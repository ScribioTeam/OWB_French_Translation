  nf_npe.1.t: "The Greatest Carol Ever Sung"
  nf_npe.1.d: "Before the war, an unknown and relatively minor senator was invited to join the Enclave. Despite his meagre political prowess, he was a charismatic and jolly husband, who loved the holidays and his people: the American people! He was an intellectual sort, and regularly inspected some of the Enclave’s finest research labs. On one such visit, however, he was infected with the New Plague and condemned to a hazmat suit.\n\nDesperate for a cure, he pleaded with his superiors to let him try the new vaccine being developed for the disease. Although few of the Enclave were keen on one of their own being subjected to FEV, the voices of those who wished to use the Senator as a preliminary trial of the cure eventually outweighed those who did not. After being treated with FEV, the senator was sealed in cryostasis in a remote research lab in Alaska. Not too soon after, the Great War began.\n\nDecades passed, and the researchers left behind to monitor the Senator had children, and those children had children, and by 2241 those children refused the call to arms issued by the Enclave. Instead, they stayed with their charge, the mysterious frozen man with a beard as white as snow. Inside his frosty coffin, the FEV addled brain and body of the senator had been changing over hundreds of years. By 2277, when the automated system had finally decided he was free of the New Plague, he awoke a different man, a changed man. What left the cryochamber was not just any senator, it was Senator Claus. But Mr. Claus came out with a quirk, he was overly..."

  nf_npe.2.t: "A Tale of FEV and Elves"
  nf_npe.2.d: "It wasn’t just Mr. Claus who experienced great change during his isolation. His elves, the faithful descendants of his less-than-well-intentioned caretakers had undergone a dramatic transformation of their own. Exposed to a high concentration of leaked, airborne FEV for decades, the residents of the hidden lab evolved into unsightly little creatures. Squat but strong, smaller than a man but able to bend steel, these horrid little creatures loved Mr. Claus more than anything else in the world.\n\nWhen he awoke, Senator Claus discovered his Eleves waiting for him. But they were different from the elves he knew, from the elves in the stories his feverish mind concocted for his own benefit. In the stories he knew, elves were nothing more than small adults in quaint green clothing, who made toys and gifts in his workshop. Now however, they were mean, green, present wrapping machines. And more than that, unlike normal elves, they were much..."
  nf_npe.2.a: "...Stronger"
  nf_npe.2.b: "...Faster"
  nf_npe.2.c: "...Smarter"

  nf_npe.3.t: "A Nice Speech"
  nf_npe.3.d: "\"Ho ho ho! It’s just about time, isn’t it?\" Senator Claus said to his assistant, Jack Faust. The man simply nodded in response and pointed at the script the elves had prepared for Mr. Claus. \"Bah humbug!\" he bellowed, \"I don’t need a piece of paper, I need a Christmas speech that comes from the heart! I need all the children of the Wasteland to know how much I want to §Gspread joy!§!\" Faust merely nodded once more, indicating towards the ham radio.\n\nMr. Claus adjusted his Christmas hat and chuckled to himself. \"Who knew I would be spreading Christmas cheer across the radio! I’m amazed you were able to make the preparations to have me heard across the Wasteland. That’s my elves for you!\" After a few moments, a red light turned green, and Senator Claus opened his mouth."
  nf_npe.3.a: "\"Ho ho ho...\""

  nf_npe.4.t: "A Naughty Speech"
  nf_npe.4.d: "\"Ho ho ho! It’s just about time, isn’t it?\" Senator Claus said to his assistant, Jack Faust. The man simply nodded in response and pointed at the script the elves had prepared for Mr. Claus. \"Bah humbug!\" he bellowed, \"I don’t need a piece of paper, I need a Christmas speech that comes from the heart! I need all the children of the Wasteland to know how much I want to §Rkill them!§!\" Faust merely nodded once more, indicating towards the ham radio.\n\nMr. Claus adjusted his Christmas hat and chuckled to himself. \"Who knew I would be spreading Christmas cheer across the radio! I’m amazed you were able to make the preparations to have me heard across the Wasteland. That’s my elves for you!\" After a few moments, a red light turned green, and Senator Claus opened his mouth."
  nf_npe.4.a: "\"Ho ho ho...\""

  nf_npe.5.t: "Senator Claus Announces Himself!"
  nf_npe.5.d: "\"Ho ho ho!\" bellowed a voice from radios across the nation. \"Hello there boys and girls of the Wasteland, it is I, Senator Claus! After decades in hibernation in the north, I have returned to spread joy and cheer to the world!\" A hearty laugh echoes from the speaker, and fills the hearts of all who hear it with glee. \"Despite the dire circumstances of the world now, I can still see the spirit of Christmas alive and well in all of your hearts! Mr. Claus is here to reward all your efforts each holiday season, just like before!\"\n\nAfter another chuckle, the man continues in a more sombre tone. \"Still, some of you boys and girls have become VERY naughty in my absence, and I think you all need to be taught a lesson by Senator Claus! Ho ho ho, don’t worry, I’ll only kill the scum of the earth. To the rest of you, the good boys and girls of the Wasteland, thank you for remembering me! I’ll be sure to visit each and every one of you on Christmas to give you what you deserve. Remember, I’ve got my list, and I’ll be checking it twice! I’m. Watching. You.\""
  nf_npe.5.a: "...What?"

  nf_npe.6.t: "Senator Claus Announces Himself!"
  nf_npe.6.d: "\"Ho ho ho!\" bellowed a voice from radios across the nation. \"Hello there boys and girls of the Wasteland, it is I, Senator Claus! After decades in hibernation in the north, I have returned to spread joy and cheer to the world!\" Although his voice started out cheery, as the man went on, his tone dropped and he began to spit the words out with great effort. After a long, awkward silence, the sound of glass shattering can be faintly heard from the radio. Then, a bellowing cry, \"At least, I would be spreading joy, had you not all FORGOTTEN CHRISTMAS!\"\n\nThe sound of anguished, deranged screaming fills the air. \"I had made plans to spread good will and cheer upon my return to America, but in my absence all the little boys and girls of the world have grown SICK. It has become clear to me, much to my dismay, that nobody cares about Christmas anymore! Without Christmas cheer in your hearts, each and every one of you has become a deranged barbaric cretin, undeserving of the greatest gift of all: life! I’ve got my list, I’ve checked it twice, and now I’m coming to personally teach each and every one of you the TRUE meaning of Christmas!\""
