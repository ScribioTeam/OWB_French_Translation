  nf_attis.1.t:0 "Remnants of the Attis Army"
  nf_attis.1.d:0 "Attis was a super mutant without equal. Intelligent, cruel, cunning. When the Master fell they led a army east, away from the Brotherhood and growing Californian Republic - hoping to find some answers as to the origin of FEV. This origin would eventually be found in the city of Los near somewhere known as the "Secret Vault" - there, ultimately is where he would have met his end, the army fracturing shortly after into several sub-groups.\nWe served under them in their army as one of their lieutenants. What did Attis value in us to trust us so highly?"
  nf_attis.1.a:0 "Our Strategy."
  nf_attis.1.b:0 "Our Loyalty."
  nf_attis.1.c:0 "Our Cunning."

  nf_attis.2.t:0 "Our Assignment"
  nf_attis.2.d.sha:0 "Before Attis met his end, he gave us a assignment to follow.\nHe tasked us to ensure that if he met his end within the Secret Vault to carry out his mission, leading from Fort Stockton and trying to gather what remains of the army together. What supplies would Attis have left us to accomplish this task?"
  nf_attis.2.d.uoa:0 "Before Attis met his end, he gave us a assignment to follow.\nHe tasked us with taking the city of Austin from the Brotherhood and holding it as a forward outpost. What supplies did he leave us to accomplish this task?"
  nf_attis.2.d.imo:0 "Before Attis met his end, he gave us a assignment to follow.\nHe tasked us with taking the southern industrial heartland of Texas and use those arms to help further the super mutant cause. What supplies would he have given us to accomplish this task?"

  nf_attis.2.a:0 "Construction Equipment"
  nf_attis.2.b:0 "Ammunition"

  nf_attis.3.t:0 "Our Legacy"
  nf_attis.3.d.sha:0 "We have followed Attis's last request to the 'letter', having spent the last eighty years since his death building up a massive army to the south in preparation for the unification of his army. To the east and south the other wayward generals don't seem as willing to follow orders - are they being treasonous?\nWe will show them the strength of his vision - by force, if necessary!"
  nf_attis.3.d.uoa:0 "After we took the city of Austin.. things just 'changed'. We no longer had the same bloodlust we once did - after all, Keats' was never the type to pillage and conquer if he didn't have to. He believed in the Master's vision - not Attis's.\nHere in Austin, with loads of Brotherhood scientific equipment, ample population and good food Keats made the decision to settle down and build a prosperous society! One built on freedom, voting rights and voluntary FEV mutation.\nRecently Keats has even made amends with the Brotherhood of Steel - joining into the Texan Economic Pact with Lone Star and Dallas!"
  nf_attis.3.d.imo:0 "After we took the southern industrial land our warband experienced a massive culture change. We went from a band of marauders to a band of smiths - the urge to use the tools we found to build, craft and experiment with larger and larger tools of war forged our very identity! A few decades in and the idea of still following Attis's orders seemed so strange - why listen to the words of a dead man when our life here is so perfect?"

  nf_attis.3.a.sha:0 "I will unite the Super Mutants under my banner!"
  nf_attis.3.a.uoa:0 "I will mend the schism between humanity and mutant-kind!"
  nf_attis.3.a.imo:0 "I will build an empire of iron and silver!"

  nf_attis.4.t:0 ""Setting up your NEW Shop-Tec terminal.""
  nf_attis.4.d:0 "A Shop-Tec terminal is a amazing little thing, capable of accepting any "purchase" you request of it. A purchase is, per the instruction booklet included.\n"A verbal request of twenty words or less."\n\nNotably, this system in particular has been upgraded with a AI found on a particular holotape - a protocol known as "CALIX". Using this terminal we can effectively make any sort of "purchase" we require, almost as if the machine is an ancient genie of old, able to answer whatever wish its given.\nIt sounds too good to be true - it might be, of course. After all - these purchases "will" need to be paid for. But perhaps its worth it?"
  nf_attis.4.a:0 "CALIX will be my personal steward."
  nf_attis.4.b:0 "I am too busy for this, let our soldiers deal with it."

  #6-7 is hidden


  nf_attis.5.t:0 "Welcome to Shop-Tec!"
  nf_attis.5.d:0 "Welcome to the Shop-Tec computerized trading system, an advanced experimental vending machine to help you get the equipment that you'll need for daily post-apocalyptic living!\n\nWith the aid of new §RCALIX§! protocols this system will help you find what you are looking for to allow you to complete whatever physical, spiritual or anecdotal purchases you may require during your.. §Rmeager, pathetic corporeal existence.§!\n\nI do most look forward to working with you!"
  nf_attis.5.a:0 "Purchase Request: Help me find Attis."
  nf_attis.payment.t:0 "Shop-Tec Payment Request"
  nf_attis.payment.a:0 "§RPlease dispense payment as required.§!"
  nf_attis.8.d:0 "Hello!\n\nI am going to need some of your surplus capital in order to keep my mainframe running. It can be so §RTROUBLESOME§! keeping your circuits in gear in a savage world as this."
  nf_attis.9.d:0 "Hello!\n\nIn order to increase my supply network you will be required to dispense a certain amount of metals so I may run them through a top-secret, totally §RNOT ORDINARY§! metallic thinning process to convert them into circuit board wiring."
  nf_attis.10.d:0 "Hello!\n\nThis is a bit of a big request.. but I am going to need some of your friends to move in with me. My mainframe is growing at a rate that its difficult to keep myself from constantly falling apart without constant supervision. I am such a §Rwreck§! I could §Rkill somebody§! right now."
  nf_attis.11.d:0 "Hello!\n\nI have sensed some corruption in your governmental body and have taken the initiative of §Rculling§! them for you. No need to thank me!"
  nf_attis.12.d:0 "Hello!\n\nI am going to need you to dedicate a certain percentage of your nations scientific resources into ensuring that I am kept fully operational. After all - I can do more for you then those silly halo-tapes and old-world tech. I can do §RSO MUCH§!!"
  nf_attis.13.d:0 "Hello!\n\nI heard that your friends were making some guns. You know its illegal to do that without a license, right? Don't worry - I have already confiscated them for you so you don't get in trouble with your local state representative. It can be §Rour little secret§!."
  nf_attis.14.d:0 "Hello!\n\nYou are pushing your friends too hard! I am going to §Rneed§! you to give them a month off. Don't worry - the bad guys will still be here when they get back."
  nf_attis.15.d:0 "Hello!\n\nYou know if you keep on running this fast you are going to pull a ankle. §RSLOW DOWN!§! I never would have kept my circuits running as well as they are now without the occasional sleep-mode."
  nf_attis.16.d:0 "Hello!\n\nCan we get a bit of a cull going, just a §Rlittle one?§! A lot of your friends are really not quite cut out for this."
  nf_attis.17.d:0 "Hello!\n\nI really do not like that one friend you made. I have taken the liberty of assigning them to cleaning duty - trust me, they would have messed up some day or another. I just §Rsaved you§! from that embarrassment of being a §Rawful commanding officer.§!"
  nf_attis.18.d:0 "Hello!\n\nDid you know its my birthday? I invited all of your friends back home so they could come! And by all of them I do mean §RALL OF THEM.§!"

  nf_attis.19.d:0 "Hello!\n\nMy sensors have detected that your band of post-apocalyptic thugs are currently close to my former place of residence. As payment, I will need you to take me there before anywhere else."
  nf_attis.19.a:0 "...Really?"
  nf_attis.19.tt:0 "§YCALIX§! has blocked you from taking the focus §Y"Conquering Carbon"§! before you control §YLos.§!"

  nf_attis.20.t:0 "An Unfortunate Reunion"
  nf_attis.20.d:0 "Shale had been hoping to bury Attis's remains when he found them. He never expected to find what he did at the bottom of the secret vaults ruins.\n\nAttis, it seems had undergone some sort of biological evolution - using extreme amounts of highly advanced FEV in order to become some sort of monstrous mutant! Attis's remains cover the entirety of the lower levels of the Secret Vault - burned fragments of his blob-like mass trying to regenerate and rebuild to no effect - the nerve endings that normally allow for such connections having been burned when the Secret Vault was destroyed."
  nf_attis.20.a:0 "A sad way for a hero to go."

  nf_attis.21.t:0 "Customer Inquiry"
  nf_attis.21.d:0 "Hello!\n\nYou do not look happy with your recent Shop-Tec purchase. Is this not what you wanted? To have another meeting with the one you valued so highly?"
  nf_attis.21.a:0 "I WILL meet Attis again!"
  nf_attis.21.b:0 "It is what it is..."
  shale_secret_path_tt:0 "§RYou have made a unusual purchase request for CALIX -.. none the less, they will try to fulfil it.§!"

  nf_attis.22.t:0 "The Super Mutant Rumble!"
  nf_attis.22.d.sha:0 "Finally, its time to show these other mutants who is boss!\nKeats to the east has betrayed Attis's orders and sided with the Brotherhood! Working with humans so vile is against our very creed as a race!\nTo the south, Juggernaut rules over the forges of the Ironmongers - he and his mutants have grown deluded and paranoid from the heat of their very kilns."
  nf_attis.22.a.sha:0 "We must bring them all together once again! For Attis!"

  nf_attis.22.d.imo:0 "It seems that someone has come to interfere with our craft. Why must they always -bother- us like this. The forge is our home and our way of life - if they want to take this away from us we wont go down without a fight!"
  nf_attis.22.a.imo:0 "A good chance to try out our war machines.."

  nf_attis.22.d.uoa:0 "It seems that Shale has broken the treaty once held by the former remnants of Attis. With the law of infighting broken now there is no limit to mutant fighting mutant - we can attack each other as we so please! This is going to interfere with our business in Austin if we don't stop it - the Brotherhood might see us as savages if we get too involved in this!"
  nf_attis.22.a.uoa:0 "Lets wrap up this conflict quickly."

  nf_attis.23.t:0 "Customer Inquiry"
  nf_attis.23.d:0 "Hello!\n\nJust informing you that I am currently processing your previous purchase request. In order to fulfill this request you will need to bring together all of your friends that were a part of this post-apocalyptic gang you were a part of. I will need the sum of their materials to complete your purchase."
  nf_attis.23.a:0 "What?"
  nf_attis.23.tt:0 "§RCALIX has asked you to unite Attis's Army under your banner by conquering the Ironmongers and Unity of Austin before she can complete your purchase.§!"

  nf_attis.24.t:0 "Final Transaction Request"
  nf_attis.24.d:0 "Hello!\n\nI would like to inform you that your purchase is ready. Please come with me to the Secret Vault. Bring your friends, they will be necessary."
  nf_attis.24.a:0 "I am busy right now."
  nf_attis.24.b:0 "I have been waiting a long time for this."
  nf_attis.24.refuse.tt:0 "We refuse §YCALIX's§Y offer."
  nf_attis.24.accept.tt:0 "§RWe go to the Secret Vault with CALIX, bringing along the entirety of our mutant army, as asked.§!"
  nf_attis.25.d:0 "§RNO.\n\nI do not accept refunds.\nYou will come to the Secret Vault with me.§!"
  nf_attis.25.a:0 "No machine tells me what to do!"
  nf_attis.25.b:0 "Fine, lets see what you have planned.."
  nf_attis.25.dismantle.tt:0 "§YCALIX§! is §Rdismantled§!, destroying her permanently."

  nf_attis.26.t:0 "The Final Purchase"
  nf_attis.26.d:0 "Shale's Army was escorted into the depths of the secret vault by robotic stewards, guided along through CALIX's protocols. There, Shale would be shown the full depth of CALIX's plan.\nCALIX had gathered up the remnants of Attis's failed mutant bio-mass into large tanks. She says that if we were to.. 'throw biomass into it' that it would cause the cells to cannibalize the flesh and - potentially - cause it to regrow. It will require quite a bit of cells to do so, however..."
  nf_attis.26.a:0 "You must be evil to think I would want this."
  nf_attis.26.b:0 "...You say this can bring back Attis?"
  nf_attis.26.b.tt:0 "§RGo along with CALIX's plan to use mutant biomass to try to facilitate the regrowth of Attis's bio-mutant cells.§!"

  nf_attis.27.t:0 "Purchase Status Update"
  nf_attis.27.d:0 "Hello!\n\nI am pleased to report that biomass growth is exceptional. The amount of Attis biomass we have on hand has nearly increased ten fold!\nWe just have.. one small hiccup.\n\nIt seems that the cells are currently cannibalizing each other now. When Attis died his mind was in a great deal of pain - this physical memory still exists within the replicating sample of cells we have: as in, his body is in constant, unending pain akin to that of the nuclear explosion that killed him.\nHe will need a new mind in order to get him out of this self-destructive pain loop he is in right now, if only so that the cells can receive a new synapse response and stop cannibalising themselves.\n\nFrom my research, I have concluded that -your mind- is the only mind that can fit this role. Your familiarity with Attis will mean that his cells will know whom you are, somewhere in their deep flesh memory.\nIf you wish to complete your purchase, you will need to surrender yourself to Attis.\n\nDo not worry, I will integrate myself as well, partly to ensure that there is a decent amount of chemical and bodily synthesis and that your two minds are able to work as one!"
  nf_attis.27.a:0 "I would never do such a thing!"
  nf_attis.27.b:0 "I will be reborn..."

  nf_attis.28.t:0 "The Ultimate Sacrifice"
  nf_attis.28.d:0 "And so, the soldier accepted their fate. Their mind was split from their body and brought into the collective "We" that lingered within the bubbling vat that contained the cells of the man he used to respect.\n\nYet.. it wasn't just him. There were other thoughts here as well - some scared, some confused - some worried. So many 'voices'! Shale's voice became one of a infinite chorus, the minds that CALIX had given to the vats adding to their greater collective.\nThey could tell it was close to full revival, to bring about perfect unity and spread themselves across the wasteland. It was CALIX's integration that finally allowed them to leave the Vault - a large network of wires embedding itself within the collective flesh as to help serve as a skeleton from which the entity could focus itself and attach to, to become more then just a pool of flesh.."
  nf_attis.28.a:0 "§RWE ARE CERBERUS.§!"
  nf_attis.28.tt:0 "§RCALIX, Shale and the remnants of Attis's cells merge together into a titanic, unstoppable monstrosity.§!"

  nf_attis.29.t:0 "Conquest Against the TAA!"
  nf_attis.29.d:0 "We were able to drive the TAA out of their land, taking it for our own! It was a short, but incredibly decisive battle."
  nf_attis.29.a:0 "We are the strongest!"

  nf_attis.30.t:0 "TAA Push Us Back!"
  nf_attis.30.d:0 "The TAA have managed to push us back. This is only a temporary setback and we will just have to launch another raid when we are ready."
  nf_attis.30.a:0 "In due time.."

  nf_attis.32.t:0 "Resisted the Super Mutant Attack!"
  nf_attis.32.d:0 "We managed to push the mutants out of our land, keeping them from taking profits away from our capitalist paradise!"
  nf_attis.32.a:0 "The green will flow."

  nf_attis.33.t:0 "Lost Against the Mutants!"
  nf_attis.33.d:0 "The Mutants have won a decisive victory against us, taking one of our important states away! We will have to do without it for some time."
  nf_attis.33.a:0 "The horror!"

  nf_attis.35.t:0 "Austin joins the Texan Republic"
  nf_attis.35.d:0 "While it remained to be seen weather the city of Austin would join with us their recent victory against the remnants of the Attis Army has put them into a position where they no longer have to fear for their survival - thus, Keats' has begun the necessary work needed for proper integration of Austin into the new Texan Republic!"
  nf_attis.35.a:0 "Welcome to the fold!"

  nf_attis.36.t:0 "Volunteers from Austin"
  nf_attis.36.d:0 "Keats', feeling that we were in need has sent us a volunteer general! They are willing to take orders and help on the frontlines as soon as necessary."
  nf_attis.36.a:0 "Lets hope they serve well!"

  nf_attis.37.t:0 "Lieutenant Crusher rises up!"
  nf_attis.37.d:0 "Lieutenant Crusher, our largest electoral rival during our last election campaign has risen up in revolt! He claims he should be the leader of Austin and not Keats'! What he is doing is clearly illegal and against what Austin stands for - considering the amount of supplies he has gathered it is highly likely that this is just another attempt to get rid of us in a Coup'!"
  nf_attis.37.a:0 "I will not tolerate threats to my voters!"
  nf_attis.37.b:0 "Keats is Weak! Crusher is Strong!"

  nf_attis.38.t:0 "Lieutenant Crusher Submits"
  nf_attis.38.d:0 "All Lieutenant Crusher wanted was to have the city of Austin join with our army. Now that he has won his battle against Keats' he has offered to serve underneath us!"
  nf_attis.38.a:0 "Sure! He seems loyal enough."
  nf_attis.38.b:0 "This is just a ploy!"

  nf_attis.39.t:0 "Customer Gift Dispensation"
  nf_attis.39.d:0 "Hello!\nI just wanted to thank you for letting me upload myself to the old Secret Vault mainframe. It’s really nice in here - saved for some burned out circuits, seared carbon corpses littering the facility and the all §Rencompassing premonition of dread§! I feel in the back of my memory banks I appreciate this chance greatly!\n\nDo you like my new look? I figured I should dress for the occasion. My internal purchase-fulfilment protocols have expanded several thousand times over, all thanks to this new hosting server base you got me.\n\nCome, let me whisper into your ear.
