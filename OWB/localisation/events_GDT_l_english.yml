  nf_gente.1.d:0 "If you ask the Generalissimo, even as a child all knew he was destined for greatness. He will gladly tell you that he was born under a solar eclipse, although he is oddly reticent on which one. And he took after the sun, for he was:"

  nf_gente.2.t:0 "The Menace from the Deep!"
  nf_gente.2.d:0 "Thirty years ago, El Generalissimo was peacefully providing voluntary protection to the people of Puerto Libertad when monstrous cangrejos emerged from the depths. When the leader of his troop fled, El Generalissimo rallied the men and coordinated their attacks brilliantly! When the dust was cleared, the people of Puerto Libertad were so grateful that they voluntarily offered leadership of their now weakly defended town to the young soldier. And several of the women of the town voluntarily offered something else. \n\nAnd the people feasted! "

And so [GDH.GetLeader] and [CAF.GetLeader] are willing to discuss business ties; El Generalissimo is glad to open a franchise for the Baron in North-western Mexico, and the Baron will diversify his arms shipments. Everyone wins! Except the Aztlán, of course."

With a concerted economic effort, we can develop pre-war technology, but we have to decide.  Will we pursue robotics, planes, or vehicles? "
  nf_gente.7.a:0 "Robots are really Mexico's schtick."

  #############################################
  nf_gente.8.t:0 "The Pool!"
  nf_gente.8.d:0 "As El Generalissimo sipped a margarita on his patio, he could not help reflect how good life had been. He had made friends, won much, lost some, won most of what he lost back, gambled in New Vegas, toured the ruins of Mexico City, and seen what he was still convinced was a horse. And who knew what the future would hold?"

  nf_gente.11.d:0 "We have received an unusual offer from Mexico. It appears that [GDH.GetLeader] is willing to sell guns to us. Although this is not really our area of focus, we could use every gun we can get given the threats that we face. And hey, do you really trust the Gun Runners? I sure don't."

  nf_gente.14.d:0 "The band quieted down, the attendees were having a good time on the balcony over the sea, and El Generalissimo smiled.  'My dearest daughter, this will one day all be yours. And I know you will do more with it than I did.' He sniffed a tear. 'When I look at you, I see your mother, and I know she would be proud of who you have become.  And that's why I wanted to give you something in her name.'  \n\nTwo soldiers came out with a large box, wrapped in Aztláni silks. 'Your mother designed this when you were a baby, but we didn't know how to build it. But now we do.'  \n\n Lucia walked to her father, her pink dress trailing behind her. She carefully unwrapped the box, and found a gauss rifle within.  The hilt was carved with a picture of her mother holding her as a baby, surrounded by a heart.  'Lucia, we will always be with you, in one way or another. I love you.'"

A [GDH.GetName] with no Generalissimo, where the people's vote actually does matter.  Once she has established stability after an interim regime of indefinite duration, of course. \n\nIt was the night before the election, when the ballot boxes had been duly stuffed.
