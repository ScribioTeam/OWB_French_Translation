  ### Assimilation Decisions
 exodus_refugee_assimilation:0 "Refugees"
 exodus_refugee_assimilation_desc:0 "As states are conquered in the Wasteland, §Yrefugees§! will flee new occupation and seek to start anew elsewhere. When such refugees reach our nation, they join our §OUnassimilated Refugee§! pool. We can §Gassimilate§! these §Yrefugees§! for a manpower boost in our core states, either by letting time play out or through making a conscious political effort. \n\nCurrently we have [?unassimilated_refugees|Y0] §OUnassimilated Refugees§! across the nation. This is [?refugee_to_core_ratio|%R] of our §Ycore population§!, and we thus suffer a [?ratio_modifier_stab|%R] §Ystability impact§!. \n\nSince the start of the game, [?all_time_refugees|Y0] §ORefugees§! have arrived in our nation, of whom [?all_time_assimilate|Y0] have §Gassimilated§! and [?all_time_expelled|Y0] have been §Rexpelled§! to date."
 exodus_assimilation_pulse_mission:0 "Passive Refugee Assimilation"
 exodus_assimilation_pulse_mission_desc:0 "Every four weeks, a fraction of our total §OUnassimilated Refugees§! will integrate evenly across our §Ycore states§!, bolstering our §Ymanpower pool§! proportional to our §OAssimilation Proportion§!. This proportion depends on §Ynational spirits§!, §Ytechnologies§! and §YOutsider Recruitment laws§!."
 nationwide_assimilation_drive:0 "Nationwide Assimilation Drive"
 nationwide_assimilation_drive_desc:0 "Through the expenditure of some political will, we can integrate a month's worth of §Orefugees§! straight into our civilian population. Handy in a pinch, it'll also help to alleviate the stability penalty from §OUnassimilated Refugees§!."

 expel_refugees:0 "Turn Away Refugees"
 expel_refugees_desc:0 "While we'd much prefer to assimilate the sizable number of refugees in our nation, the sheer number of them relative to our own core population makes this entirely unfeasible. Instead, we're going to have to turn a portion of our refugee population away from our lands to maintain stability."
 expel_refugees_trig_tt:0 "§OUnassimilated Refugees§! are causing more than a §R15%§! §Ystability§! penalty."
