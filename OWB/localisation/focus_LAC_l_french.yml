 lac_drastic_measures:0 "Mesures Drastiques "
 lac_drastic_measures_desc:0 "Dans des circonstances inexplicables, César s'est volatilisé et un Kaiser est arrivé à sa place. Le légat de Malpais, Vulpes, et d'autres se sont mis sous son influence - peut-être à la recherche d'une chance de gloire en ces temps incertains - et Lanius est le seul à s'y opposer."
  lac_loyal_reinforcements:0 "Loyal Reinforcements"
  lac_loyal_reinforcements_desc:0 "Lanius is not alone in his opposition to this new supposed §R\"Kaiser\"§!, and a great number of loyal legions have congregated under his banner of opposition. In time, more will follow, and the brutal reality of the so-called §R\"Kaiser's\"§! perilous position will become all too apparent."
  lac_the_legacy_of_caesar:0 "The Legacy of Caesar"
  lac_the_legacy_of_caesar_desc:0 "It would be incorrect to say that Lanius liked Caesar, but he respected him and his his military prowess. His teachings in the art of war were invalubale, forever changing the fate of the Eighty Seven Tribes. None other than Caesar could have conquered and ruled Arizona, §Rand none other than Caesar's Legion is fit to rule in his stead.§!"
  lac_to_the_victor_go_the_spoils:0 "To the Victor Go the Spoils"
  lac_to_the_victor_go_the_spoils_desc:0 "If Lanius's Cohort ever hopes to face the industrial might of §R\"Kasier's Legion\"§!, it must first become its equal. It would take too long to painstakingly construct new workshops, and it is not the way of the Legion regardless. No, the Legion abides by one truth alone: if you want something, take it. If you need something? §RKill for it.§!"
  lac_uproot_twin_mothers:0 "Uproot Twin Mothers"
  lac_uproot_twin_mothers_desc:0 "Nestled in the northwest of our territory, the tribals of Twin Mothers have always been an annoyance. In the past, we let them be, as there were more glorious tribes to face; but things are different now. Twin Mothers stands between us and glory, and like all who stand before the bull, they will be skewered."
  lac_stepping_on_scorpions:0 "Stepping on Scorpions"
  lac_stepping_on_scorpions_desc:0 "Scorpion's Bite are a small tribe of little means, pathetically clinging to their territory and way of life in the face of changing times. All that's needed for their demise is a little push, or in this case, the point of a sword."
  lac_kicking_dogs:0 "Kicking Dogs"
  lac_kicking_dogs_desc:0 "Infamous for their beastmasters, the Hangdogs are perhaps the most formidable we must face in Colorado. Their commanders are deathly intelligent, their warriors fervent and cunning. This will not be an easy war, but for the sake of our future Dog City must be ours."
  lac_beating_iron:0 "Pounding Iron"
  lac_beating_iron_desc:0 "Mercenaries are of no concern to the Legion... usually. The Iron Alliance, holed up in the north of Colorado, are a formidable mercenary band who make use of power armour to great effect. We must remember how Caesar dealt with Maxson Bunker and put his stratagems into play if we hope to defeat them."
  lac_assert_our_hegemony:0 "Assert Our Hegemony"
  lac_assert_our_hegemony_desc:0 "With our conquest of Colorado's major threats finished, we must now reinforce our position and remind our new underlings of their position in the Legion. With our control over the heart of the northern front secured, we can begin to make designs on what remains of Colorado..."
  lac_total_war:0 "Total War"
  lac_total_war_desc:0 "Rome was not finished in a day, nor did it found its empire on the backs of a few. If we are to create a new empire in our own image, one that will last for years to come, we need more bodies. We would do well to remind our tribes of their obligations to the late Caesar, and to his replacement: Lanius."
  lac_decolonise_pecos:0 "Decolonise Pecos"
  lac_decolonise_pecos_desc:0 "Pecos' Colony has long been considered a candidate for southern expansion, and with the political situation in the Land of Titans as precarious as ever, now is the time to strike. With a foothold in the south, we can make headway on our conquest of the region as a whole."
  lac_recall_paullus:0 "Recall Paullus"
  lac_recall_paullus_desc:0 "Centurion Paullus was an egotist of the highest calibre, and his bitter defeat was a lesson to those in the Legion who sought glory they weren't due. But despite his failure, he will still prove useful in our conquest of the Rio. We must have him."
  lac_shatter_the_republic:0 "Shatter the Republic"
  lac_shatter_the_republic_desc:0 "The time has come for us to strike down the Republic of the Rio Grande and their foolish democratic principles. With their country currently in shambles, putting them in the annals of history as little more than a footnote will be a simple task."
  lac_the_pact:0 "The Pact"
  lac_the_pact_desc:0 "Santa Anna rules over the eastern seaboard of North Mexico, and his erratic presence has long been a thorn in the side of the Republic of the Rio Grande. It's said that he dislikes humans, but that he hates the RRG more. Machines are strange, backwards creations of the old world, but their metal minds think in straight-forward ways. If we show that we can defeat his greatest rival once and for all, he may join our cause."
  lac_hegemony_over_the_rio:0 "Hegemony Over the Rio"
  lac_hegemony_over_the_rio_desc:0 "With the Republic of the Rio Grande finished, and the north's most powerful antagonist in our pocket, our dominion over the Rio is unquestionable. Now we must set to reinforcing our rule, implementing Caesar's occupation policies to the letter without fail, and teaching the people of Mexico what civilisation really looks like. The yoke of democracy has bound them for decades, but we will set them free."
  lac_the_rightful_master_of_colorado:0 "The Rightful Master of Colorado"
  lac_the_rightful_master_of_colorado_desc:0 "Our territory stretches from one end of the Rio to the other—almost. Still yet much of Colorado remains free of our grasp, and with our new nation armed to the teeth and ready to reap glory from our neighbours, the time is right to strike at what remains of our rightful lands. Once we hold Colorado, our rightful place in Arizona will become all too clear."
  lac_correct_the_timeline:0 "Correct the Timeline"
  lac_correct_the_timeline_desc:0 "The §R\"Kaiser\"§! is not of our world, of that much our spies are certain. He is a man of another place, another time, and of a stock entirely unfit to rule over what remains of the Legion. We will do both Caesar's legacy and the entire Wasteland a service, §Rand correct this cosmic mistake by displaying his head atop a pike outside the gates of Flagstaff.§!"
  lac_lanius_cruel_reality:0 "Lanius's Cruel Reality"
  lac_lanius_cruel_reality_desc:0 "Caesar and the Malpais Legate had ambitions for a greater Legion, a new Rome, but they were blinded by glory. Perhaps Caesar could have achieved his dreams, but with his disappearance, we must face a cruel reality: tribalism is our only path foward, and so the legion must double-down on its efforts."
  lac_promote_the_strong:0 "Promote the Strong"
  lac_promote_the_strong_desc:0 "Only the strongest can survive, and thrive, in the Wasteland. The Legion is a brutal organisation by design, and within its walled camps only the strong are deemed worthy of the attention of Mars. A strong army needs strong leaders, and thus only the best combatants are fit to be promoted above the rest."
  lac_human_wave_tactics:0 "Human Wave Tactics"
  lac_human_wave_tactics_desc:0 "Not all men are born strong and they know it. Outside of the Legion, the weak flock together out of fear, but under the banner of the Bull they form a horde greater than the sum of its parts."
  lac_empower_the_masses:0 "Empower the Masses"
  lac_empower_the_masses_desc:0 "The time has come for a radical change in our training doctrine. No longer shall we put up with merely giving the weak a place, rather, we must transform their feeble bodies in a crucible of blood and sweat. Some may die, but those who survive will thank us for our efforts."
  lac_the_red_army:0 "The Red Army"
  lac_the_red_army_desc:0 "Never before has the Wasteland seen an army as equal as ours, a mobile force of men who tower above the rest, lead by even more imposing figures who will go down in legend. They say the §R\"Kaiser\"§! fears unity under a banner called §R\"Syndicalism\"§!, and with our combined might marching in red across the river, we must remind him all too clearly of the failures of his so-called §R\"Weltkrieg\"§!."
  lac_caesars_ambition:0 "Caesar's Ambition"
  lac_caesars_ambition_desc:0 "The Legion was an army with a state, and Caesar intended to use its conquests to form the basis of comprehensive reform. While we may never achieve his ambitions of creating a new Rome, we can at the very least use his planned military reforms to significantly increase our prowess."
  lac_military_meritocracy:0 "Military Meritocracy"
  lac_military_meritocracy_desc:0 "Under our new military system, rather than merely promoting the strong, we pick and choose both the strongest and the most cunning. Now our ranks are filled not only with brilliant warriors, but cunning tacticians, and snake-like frumentarii."
  lac_sophisticated_drills:0 "Sophisticated Drills"
  lac_sophisticated_drills_desc:0 "Formerly, our combat drills mostly focused on getting our tribals combat ready, but if we intend to create the perfect army, we must increase group unity. We will focus on emphasising group tactics, and train our soldiers in large-scale combat drills to better hone their total war capability."
  lac_transform_the_frumentarii:0 "Transform the Frumentarii"
  lac_transform_the_frumentarii_desc:0 "The Frumentarii are an essential part of our covert operations, but we must upgrade their station. We will transform their organisation into Speculatore, placing their most logistically minded in positions of power overseeing our lands, while the brutal and the cunning shall deliver punishments and infiltrate our enemies like before."
  lac_the_new_roman_army:0 "The New Roman Army"
  lac_the_new_roman_army_desc:0 "With our last reform in place, and training continuing at a rapid pace, we have truly transformed our military. We now stand as the most organised army in the Wasteland, and with Mars as our guide nothing can stand in our way."
  lac_war_changes:0 "War Changes"
  lac_war_changes_desc:0 "Fools in the west claim that war, war never changes—but we know better. With the dawn of our new military, we will revolutionize the way war is fought in the Wasteland for centuries to come."
  lac_new_denarius:0 "New Denarius"
  lac_new_denarius_desc:0 "With the loss of Flagstaff we must re-establish our currency base. As is custom, every year we mint a new coin in honour of our accomplishments, and this year our coin will "
  lac_put_miners_to_work:0 "Put Miners to Work"
  lac_put_miners_to_work_desc:0 "We're not sure whether Lanius said \"miners" or \"minors\", but either way best groups best get to work gathering new metal fast."
  lac_slave_scrappers:0 "Slave Scrappers"
  lac_slave_scrappers_desc:0 "Our scrap gathering efforts are no longer sufficient, and so we must put a portion of our slaves to work to increase our haul."
  lac_blood_for_iron:0 "Blood From Iron"
  lac_blood_for_iron_desc:0 "With our pressing need for scrap growing rapidly, we can no longer afford the privilege of safety for our workers. Minimum requirements must be raised, and our workers must begin exploring raider territory and deathclaw nests to suit our needs."
  lac_search_for_water:0 "Search for Water"
  lac_search_for_water_desc:0 "Water is necessary for our very existence, and as our army grows our pressing need for water grows to match. It's high time we sought out new sources of water."
  lac_conscript_water_caravans:0 "Conscript Water Caravans"
  lac_conscript_water_caravans_desc:0 "It's not enough to rely on our civilised population to hand over a monthly water tithe, we must conscript new slaves to drive water caravans across the Wasteland in search of blue gold."
  lac_water_over_blood:0 "Water Over Blood"
  lac_water_over_blood_desc:0 "It doesn't matter how we get water, but we need it. If a slave comes back without enough water to suit our needs, he will lose a hand, or worse. If these offences are repeated, he will eventually lose his life, and forfeit his family's independance for generations to come."
  lac_raid_our_neighbours:0 "Raid Our Neighbours"
  lac_raid_our_neighbours_desc:0 "The wealth of the Wasteland is ours to take, and our neighbours must either face this reality or die by our hands. The Legion's scouts take no prisoners."
  lac_slave_raids:0 "Slave Raids"
  lac_slave_raids_desc:0 "With our need for key resources contuining to grow, it's about time we got together a portion of our slaves to send out alongside our scouts on raiding parties. With any luck, the sorry bastards will return with treasure in hand."
  lac_the_price_we_pay:0 "The Price We Pay"
  lac_the_price_we_pay_desc:0 "No longer are usual tactics sufficient to match our rapidly growing demand for resources. Our scouts must resign themselves to total war, to the thought they may never return home. Hopefully they're smart enough to let the slaves die instead, though."
  lac_roman_roads:0 "Roman Roads"
  lac_roman_roads_desc:0 "Rome had the best, most well paved roads in the world, or so we've been taught. If we're to match their mighty image, our dominion needs more infrastructure to support our expansion and troop movements."
  lac_spread_the_forges_of_mars:0 "Spread the Forges of Mars"
  lac_spread_the_forges_of_mars_desc:0 "Our army needs weapons, munitions, and armour on a scale never before seen in the Wasteland. With the loss of our factories in the west to the pretender, we must create new foundries for our military."
  lac_the_birthplace_of_civilization:0 "Birthplace of Civilization"
  lac_the_birthplace_of_civilization_desc:0 "With the progress of advanced infrastructure spreading across the land, we have come to be known as the birthplace of civilization among the tribes in the region, and to scholars within our beauracratic facilities. It's about time we matched this description, and begin grand construction effort unseen in the Wasteland."
  lac_the_pen_or_the_sword:0 "The Pen or the Sword"
  lac_the_pen_or_the_sword_desc:0 "A simple question with a complicated answer, to we abandon Caesar's ways in the pursuit of greater firepower and relevancy in the wars for America's future; or do we relegate ourselves to primitive but proven methods?"
  lac_cult_of_mars:0 "The Cult of Mars"
  lac_cult_of_mars_desc:0 "Spurred on by our adoption of advanced technology, the underground §OCult of Mars§! has made the crossing into our lands and sought council with Lanius. They bring with them might unmatched, and a fierce loyalty to the Tenants of Strength unseen outside of the priesthood. Recognising Lanius as the new Son of Mars, they pledge their sword in the name of conquest and triumph over §Rall§! false icons."
