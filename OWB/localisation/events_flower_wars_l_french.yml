  flw.5.d: "Following the outbreak of a civil war for control of the Aztlan Empire, the importance of the minor skirmishes commonly dubbed the \"Flower Wars\" has faded in the eyes of the people on both side of the border. Instead, the two powerful factions of the Aztlan Empire are at each other's throats, and rumor has it that the Itzan War Council are begging [ITZ.GetLeader] for intervention.
