Multiple parties have reported being smoked out, tied up, and blinded by a 'radiant blue light.' Though they didn't harm our scavengers, it seems like our presence is not welcome near these areas. We've not yet been able to make contact with them, until now. A representative returned with one of our scouting groups. Fully covered in a form fitting suit of advanced polymers, they delivered a simple message. 'We are the Koover Mavens, and we have a proposition for you. Help us extract §cOld World Relics§! from the ruins in your territory. We will reward you for your compliance.' Before we could respond, they seemingly evaporated into the wind, leaving only a note with a location."

Today, however, a new representative has arrived. One that claims to be more permenant. They tell us that soon, the Mavens will need our assistance, and with assistance comes reward.
