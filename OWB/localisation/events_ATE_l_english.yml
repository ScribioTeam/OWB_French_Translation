  nf_ate.1.t:0 "Reclaiming Destiny"
  nf_ate.1.d:0 "Some of those who followed the Lifebringer turned to the old ways, seeing her as a prophet who walked the same paths as the Nahuatl had. Her skills were confirmed again when the Cucarachas came from the north; monsters under an eagle banner. They broke into a military base near Xochicalo and tried to steal a Garden of Eden Creation Kit. \n\nBut the Lifebringer foresaw their arrival, although skeptics say she heard the Cucarachas broadcasting on an unencrypted channel. She reclaimed the GECK, and used it to heal the world."
  nf_ate.1.a:0 "She used the GECK on Xochicalco."
  nf_ate.1.b:0 "She used the GECK on the lands of the Early Empire."
  nf_ate.1.c:0 "She used the GECK on Mexico City."

  nf_ate.2.t:0 "The Liberator of the Aztlan"
  nf_ate.2.d:0 "The Liberator is said to have a dream in his youth in which he saw the empire crumble due to a slave revolt, spreading like a flame across the imperial banner.  To stop this, he emancipated the slaves upon ascending the throne. The Liberator used his cry of libertad to conquer towns throughout Mexico, bringing them into the empire with the aid of the people.  \n\nIn a dream after one conquest, he saw the future again. A flame spread across Mexico, but now it was spread by those who once wore chains, marching under the imperial banner. He saw those men shorn of shackles marching forth in the name of Aztlan."
  nf_ate.2.a:0 "They waved the banner of the Feathered Serpent."
  nf_ate.2.b:0 "They waved the banner of the Flayed Man."

  nf_ate.3.t:0 "The Legislator"
  nf_ate.3.d:0 "As the world began to recover from the Great War, and the Aztlan Empire arose above 'local warlord' level, one of the Speakers realized the empire needed a formal legal code.  The Josefina Code synthesized prewar Mexico's legal system with the rough and ready justice that arose since the war, imposing obligations and privileges upon the people of the empire. The code provided a safety valve for the desperate by letting them declare bankruptcy and enlist in the Aztlan army, and codified [CAF.GetName]'s position in the Empire."
  nf_ate.3.a:0 "The WASP Act gave the empire plentiful warriors."
  nf_ate.3.b:0 "The Treaty of Oaxaca ensured [CAF.GetName]'s loyalty."

  nf_ate.4.t:0 "The Wrath of the Old World"
  nf_ate.4.d:0 "The last Speaker was our greatest, but like the hummingbird who flew too high, he reached for the sun and perished.  The Speaker thought he could invade territory under the control of Tlaloc, refusing to believe that the aging AI could stop him.  \n\nThe Speaker was wrong. He and his wife perished in battle, along with ten thousand Aztlan warriors, when Tlaloc dropped a nuke on forces in [779.GetName]. The defeat threw the empire into chaos, and left his great works unfinished."
  nf_ate.4.a:0 "Oh God."

  # nf_ate.20.t:0 "The Warrior Cults"
  # nf_ate.20.d:0 "The Jaguar and Eagle cults of the Triple Alliance honored only warriors with several kills or prisoners of war, hailing them as heroes. The First Empress revived the tradition, but the Eagle and Jaguar Cults have expanded to become professional military forces.  The Jaguar Cult will welcome anyone, be they serf or nobleman, so long as they can survive the Test of Trials. The Eagle Cult only accepts the nobility, but make up for the lack of manpower with the best weapons the Empire has."
  # nf_ate.20.a:0 "They are like a spear in the hands of the sun."

  nf_ate.5.t:0 "The Great Work Undone"
  nf_ate.5.d:0 "The last Speaker knew the world was changing; Tlaloc had shielded Mexico, but he had kept it trapped in amber. No great warlord could oppress the land; but no great hero could save it, either. Pursuing the orders of a long-dead world, Tlaloc kept Mexico weak and divided, \"protecting\" Mexico by crushing any force too powerful as a \"guerilla element.\" But as he began to fail, opportunities beckoned. The ships of [CAF.GetName] brought word of bears and bulls, while the Mayans emerged from their jungles to menace the land. To survive, the Aztlan would have to become more than an empire. It would have to become a nation.  \n\nToo bad his plans perished in a mushroom cloud."
  nf_ate.5.a:0 "He left the nucleus of a professional army."
  nf_ate.5.b:0 "He left the seeds of higher learning."

  nf_ate.6.t:0 "Aztlan Riches"
  nf_ate.6.d:0 "Aztlan has always been one of our biggest customers for our coffee sales, but sometimes even we can be surprised by the demand they have. Our trade caravans have returned laden with Aztlan riches, and merchants from the empire have already begun placing hold orders for the next caravan."
  nf_ate.6.a:0 "Just like old times."

  nf_ate.7.t:0 "The Imperial Cults"
  nf_ate.7.d:0 "The Eagle and Jaguar Knights see themselves as heirs to the elite warriors of the Aztec Empire, and who can blame them? Equipped with husbanded power armor and heavy weaponry, they're a terror on a battlefield. But to equip these troops, the Aztlan sacrifice elsewhere. Peasant conscripts are equipped with pipe guns and machetes, and imperial supply lines bring luxuries to the front instead of basic rations. \n\nIf the Aztlan ever reform their military, it could be a threat to the rest of Mexico."
  nf_ate.7.a:0 "Good luck giving imperial knights to give up fresh quetzal feathers."

  nf_ate.8.t:0 "The Coffee Baron"
  nf_ate.8.d:0 "Lurking behind ever wicked deal, every corrupt official, is [CAF.GetLeader]. He wheels and deals, and has extended loans with such favorable terms that many still wonder why his fingers are in every enchilada. To this day, some still are not sure how a man who started selling coffee after a nuclear war became the one to place his grip on Mexico's economy."
  nf_ate.8.a:0 "It mostly comes from controlling trade routes."
  nf_ate.8.a_tt:0 "\nThe coffee just tastes good.\n"

  nf_ate.9.t:0 "The Frogs"
  nf_ate.9.d:0 "While the Wastes fear the awesome majesty of the jaguar knights, and the endless waves of Aztlan conscripts, the Aztlan navy is known by its rivals as \"The Frogs.\"  \n\nThe navy is home to the misfits of Aztlan society, including descendnets of Norteamericanos who tried to steal a GECK after the war, second daughters and third sons, and merchants who think they bleed just as well as any pompous noble. Nobody takes it that seriously, but Admiral Kinkaid has plans to show the world that even a frog can kill, with the right poison."
  nf_ate.9.a:0 "Sorry, more about the guys in power armor."

  nf_ate.10.t:0 "The Death of the Thunderer"
  nf_ate.10.d:0 "It comes in a dream, to the Empress. A barrage of thunder; a scream that breaks a mountain; a pillar of fire across the horizon. A bull in the palace's garden; and circling above, an eagle of stone. She wakes up in a sweat, oblivious to the darkness. \n\nFor she'd traded her vision for sight a long time ago."
  nf_ate.10.a:0 "The Empress shall speak again."

  nf_ate.11.t:0 "The Secret Moot"
  nf_ate.11.d:0 "While the tribes remain loyal to the Speaker, they are always willing to question who is the true speaker. Beneath a full moon, drunk on the Baron's special brews, the tribes listen to Armando and his plans for reform. Shouldn't everyone in the Empire enjoy its fruits? Shouldn't they, most of all?  \n\nUnder the watchtful eyes of the stars, each chieftain knelt before their new Speaker, Armando Ocēlōtl."
  nf_ate.11.a:0 "Let the Jaguar roar."

  nf_ate.12.t:0 "Approaching the Baron"
  nf_ate.12.d:0 "The Baron is many things, but a valuable ally most of all. For the right price, he can recognize more lucrative trading opportunities under the Cuauhtli."
  nf_ate.12.a:0 "Ask for the baron's neutrality in exhcange for a reduction in taxes."
  nf_ate.12.b:0 "Offer to make his involvement a grande."
  nf_ate.12.c:0 "We'll put him out of business too."

  nf_ate.14.t:0 "A Franchise Opportunity"
  nf_ate.14.d:0 "Cuauhtli has offered to significantly reduce our taxes in exchange for an alliance against the Speaker. And, should his empire expand across the rest of Mexico, he may offer us marketing opportunities as well..."
  nf_ate.14.a:0 "To aggressive revenue enhancement schemes!"
  nf_ate.14.a_tt:0 "\nWhen the Jaguar rises, we will join him against the Speaker.\n"
  nf_ate.14.b:0 "Sorry, our holding company wouldn't like that."
  nf_ate.14.b_tt:0 "\nWhen the Jaguar rises, we will take that excuse to exit."

  nf_ate.15.t:0 "The Jaguar Who Hunts the World"
  nf_ate.15.d:0 "Poison in her wine cup, daggers at her back. The stories of the Speaker's assassination vary with the telling, but what is clear is that she is dead."
  nf_ate.15.a:0 "She should've seen this coming."

  nf_ate.16.t:0 "The Baron Rejects Our Proposal"
  nf_ate.16.d:0 "Bad news, future Speaker. The Baron does not wish to ally with us against the Eagle Cult, but will instead, ahem, \"Sit here and wait for your death.\""
  nf_ate.16.a:0 "Jerk!"

  nf_ate.17.t:0 "The Baron Accepts our proposal!"
  nf_ate.17.d:0 "Good news, the Baron swears fealty to the future Speaker. The coffee supplies will be useful, but his men and guns will be even more valuable."
  nf_ate.17.a:0 "A toast to our victories!"

  nf_ate.18.t:0 "Clipped Claws"
  nf_ate.18.d:0 "The Jaguar Knight was brought before the crowd, and carried to the top of one of the pyramids that had survived the centuries. \"How could you think to oppose me?\" the Speaker asked. \"Did you forget that I can actually see the future?\""
  nf_ate.18.a:0 "I mean, obviously."

  nf_ate.19.t:0 "Clipped Wings"
  nf_ate.19.d:0 "The Aztlan Empire is a civilized land. The death penalty is reserved only for murders, and dropping someone from a plane is reserved only for traitors.  \n\nSadly, it turned out that at least one Eagle couldn't fly."
  nf_ate.19.a:0 "Adios."

  nf_ate.20.t:0 "The Bitter Brew"
  nf_ate.20.d:0 "The Baron's treachery lies before all Mexico to see, which would be fine if his allies had not already been executed.  Now he faces the undivided attention of an empire which is wondering why [FROM.GetLeader] should let [CAF.GetLeader] live."
  nf_ate.20.a:0 "Forgive the Baron in exchange restricting his influence in the Empire."
  nf_ate.20.b:0 "Time to revise the Treaty of Oaxaca."
  nf_ate.20.b.tt:0 "\n If [CAF.LeaderName] says no, we will go to war!"
  nf_ate.20.c:0 "Why do we need a Baron if we have a Speaker?"

  nf_ate.21.t:0 "The Speaker's Demand"
  nf_ate.21.d:0 "The Speaker is for some reason angry that we took part in a plot to kill her.  She is demanding revisions to the Treaty of Oaxaca in exhcnage for sparing our life. How shall we respond?"
  nf_ate.21.a:0 "We're sorry, please let us sign!"
  nf_ate.21.b:0 "We will choke our rivers with her dead! Somehow."

  nf_ate.22.t:0 "An Attempt on the Speaker's Life!"
  nf_ate.22.d:0 "Although the Speaker has eliminated the threat from the Jaguar and Imperial Cults, some of their diehard followers are angry that she ritually killed her leaders. They took aim at the Speaker in a speech before the people of Xochicalo, and the results were dire."
  nf_ate.22.a:0 "Thank Christ and the saints she ducked in time!"
  nf_ate.22.b:0 "Oh god, she's dead!"

  nf_ate.23.t:0 "The State of Emergency"
  nf_ate.23.d:0 "With the Speaker's death, Kinkaid was left in a desperate situation. The imperial cults had been crippled by the Speaker and could provide little support. And he lacked the prestige of the Speaker herself.  But Kinkaid was descended from the Yanquis had who had invaded Mexico, and their history gave him some ideas about how to govern the Empire."
  nf_ate.23.a:0 "And if those ideas don't work, maybe the next Speaker will have some better luck."

  nf_ate.24.t:0 "The Blood Pact"
  nf_ate.24.d:0 "The Jaguar has the obedience of many of the Empire's leaders, and but in the ruins of a prewar church Ocelotl takes it one step further.  Slitting his palm, he watches as drops fall into a bowl.  One after another, the nobles before him step up to the bowl and do likewise. \"Remember, you knew this was going to happen. Now you just can't back out.\""
  nf_ate.24.a:0 "This is fine."

  nf_ate.25.t:0 "The Best Deal"
  nf_ate.25.d:0 "Ocelotl has little respect for the Baron, but he understands that there is a price for such a man.  Therefore, Ocelotl offers the Baron a deal; remain neutral in the war to come, or join the Rafael as the next meal fo the Jaguar."
  nf_ate.25.a:0 "You will not find a better bargain, ghoul."

  nf_ate.26.t:0 "It's Your Problem Now"
  nf_ate.26.d:0 "[ITZ.GetName] has sought to steal Mexico City from the Aztlani for years, to no avail.  But Oceltol believes the Speaker when she prophecizes that Tlaloc's children will come for the City, and he fears the bloody Mayans will seize the empire during the civil war. Why not kill two birds with one stone, and offer the city to [ITZ.GetLeader] in exchange for a nonaggression pact during the struggle for the throne?"
  nf_ate.26.a:0 "If it makes an enemy of our enemy it's worth it."
  nf_ate.26.b:0 "I didn't plot seize the Empire to give it to a bunch of tribals."

  nf_ate.27.t:0 "Peace In Our Time"
  nf_ate.27.d:0 "The Ocelotl has agreed that, when he launches his plot to seize the Azltani throne, he will cede Mexico City in exchange for our neutrality. We can't figure out why his delegate was laughing ominously though."
  nf_ate.27.a:0 "It's probably an inside joke."
  nf_ate.27_tt:0 "We agree to a nonaggression pact with the Aztlani if the Jaguar tries to seize the throne."

  # nf_ate.28.t:0 "Aztalan Refuses!"
  # nf_ate.28.d:0 "The Aztalan delegation has refused to any more alterations to our relationship, violating both the spirit and the law of the treaty. The Baron is reportedly furious, and has vowed not to take this disrespect sitting down."
  # nf_ate.28.a:0 "Big mistake, [ATE.getleader]."

  # nf_ate.28.t:0 "Costa has refuses an alliance."
  # nf_ate.28.d:0 "Despite our generosity in granting them their freedom, Costa has apparently decided to leave us high and dry, leaving us without an ally or a servant. Honestly, this wasn't too unexpected, really."

  nf_ate.29.t:0 "Fly Like an Eagle"
  nf_ate.29.d:0 "The Speaker's terrible, bullet related accident has left Ocelotl with no choice but to become Speaker. Mexico City has swiftly fallen to the Itzans, who may press their atttack. But for now, to war!"
  nf_ate.29.a:0 "We will save the Empire!"

  nf_ate.30.t:0 "Pulling Out the Flowers"
  nf_ate.30.d:0 "The Aztlani Civil War has given, unsurprisingly, [ITZ.GetLeader] a golden opportunity to break the Aztlani Empire apart. Some suggest that now is the time to strike, but others warn that this will encourage the Aztlani to unite around some sort of hero figure who is as dashing as he is competent. \n\nWhat Would the Kalomte do?"
  nf_ate.30.a:0 "Mexico City was enough. For now."
  nf_ate.30.b:0 "What's the worst that can happen, some sort of alliance against us?"
  nf_ate.30.b_tt:0 "If you entered a nonaggression pact with the Eagle, breaking this has unpleasant consequences."

  nf_ate.31.t:0 "The Final Hunt"
  nf_ate.31.d:0 "The Aztlani are the best of old Mexico, forged through the atomic fires to become the masters of the Wasteland. We combine the learning of the old with the wisdom of the new. And we will avenge ourselves upon [Itz.GetLeader] for daring to stand in our way."
  nf_ate.31.a:0 "On to [Itz.GetCapital]!"

  nf_ate.32.t:0 "Children of the Sun"
  nf_ate.32.d:0 "The rights of the Aztlani are not written upon an Itzan parchment. We are the children of the sun, and we can no more be contained than her rays.  Our splendor will illuminate all of Mexico; whether the Itzans want it or not."
  nf_ate.32.a:0 "Those bastards really shouldn't have seized the territories during the civil war."

  nf_ate.33.t:0 "The Fate of the Mayans"
  nf_ate.33.d:0 "With the fall of the Mayans, Aztlani hegemony over the south is secured. Some argue for a tough peace, but others say the Mayans are not a conquered people, but rather loyal subjects."
  nf_ate.33.a:0 "Whether we drink from a cenote or the Lerma, we are one people."
  nf_ate.33.b:0 "They can hunt with the jaguar when we march north."

  nf_ate.34.t:0 "The Caged Eagle"
  nf_ate.34.d:0 "The Eagle may stand before the new speaker unbowed, unbent, unbroken, but still he stands. \n\nThe Jaguar had already decided Rafael's fate before he walked into the room.  It was to be:"
  nf_ate.34.a:0 "Find a cliff and see if he can fly."
  nf_ate.34.b:0 "Out of mercy, only blind him."

  nf_ate.35.t:0 "We've Always Made Our Own Luck"
  nf_ate.35.d:0 "Rafael may stand before the new speaker unbowed, unbent, unbroken, but still he stands. \n\nThe Jaguar had already decided The Eagle's fate before he walked into the room.  It was to be:"
  nf_ate.35.a:0 "Find a cliff and see if he can fly."

  nf_ate.36.t:0 "The Fate of Empire"
  nf_ate.36.d:0 "The palaces of the Itzans have fallen. The Speaker's soldiers have taken their banners as trophies. Prayers of thanks rise to Christ and the Saints, and to the Speakers of the past. The Aztlan are triumphant! But as the cobra said after strangling a brahmin, \"I have to eat the damned thing?\" \n\nSome suggest the Speaker rule all of the Aztlan Empire. But others suggest she release a puppet state. And perhaps a loyal ally should be rewarded...."
  nf_ate.36.a:0 "This land belongs to the Aztlan, for now and forever."
  nf_ate.36.a_tt:0 "\n§gI didn't survive two assassination attempts, a nuclear bomb, and this damn war to give up parts of my realm.§!"
  nf_ate.36.b:0 "The southern tribes can rule themselves, with our guidance."
  nf_ate.36.c:0 "Time the Baron to become a king."

  nf_ate.37.t:0 "Paying our Tab"
  nf_ate.37.d:0 "The Baron may regret his conduct in the war for the gold and turquoise crown, but what's done is done. How shall we honor him for his kind acts?"
  nf_ate.37.a:0 "Punish him for his treachery."
  nf_ate.37.a_tt:0 "\n§gThe Baron may have helped us seize the crown, but at the end of the day he broke faith with the last Speaker. How can we trust him?§!"
  nf_ate.37.b:0 "We thank you for your support."

  nf_ate.38.t:0 "Skinning a Jaguar"
  nf_ate.38.d:0 "The Jaguar's tribals have abandoned him, his followers are crushed. What shall we do with the Jaguar himself?"
  nf_ate.38.a:0 "Let us see how he does in a fight with his namesakes."
  nf_ate.38.b:0 "Let him make a public sign of submission and make a bloood oath to the new Speaker!"

  nf_ate.39.t:0 "The Most Dangerous Game"
  nf_ate.39.d:0 "The Jaguar's tribals have abandoned him, and after chasing him across the empire we found found him hiding in a prewar hotel in Acapulco. We can use this moment to determine the fate of his supporters. What shall we do?"
  nf_ate.39.a:0 "Punish them."
  nf_ate.39.b:0 "A Speaker must know when to be merciful."

  nf_ate.40.t:0 "Reviving the Mexican Constitution"
  nf_ate.40.d:0 "The Speaker lacks the powers of prophecy or the support of the imperial cults. But the Empire's real strength comes from its farmers and craftsmen, not crazy women who helpfully point out things like \"the AI that's breaking down will probably die soon.\"  To win their support, Kinkaid will guarantee the rights their ancestors held dear. \n\nThe Mexican constitution has been a dead letter outside of [RRG.GetName] since before the Great War, but people still remember when the government worked for them. The Speaker has announced that Aztlan will adopt the constitution and affirm all of its citizens are free and equal."
  nf_ate.40.a:0 "These rights cannot be denied and they cannot be suspended...."
  nf_ate.40.a_tt:0 "\nCoring costs on Mexican states are reduced by §M25%§!"

  nf_ate.41.t:0 "Are You Smarter Than a Supermutant?"
  nf_ate.41.d:0 "Oh, so sorry Senora Seven Flowers, but \"Navarro, I guess?\" is not the capital of the New California Republic. Seneca, what's your guess? That's right, it's Shady Sands! Well, don't worry, Senora, you'll still be going home with a year's supply of Costa Cafeinada coffee. Costa Cafeinada: So addictive you probably shouldn't check what's in it! \n\nAnd that's all for tonight folks. Tune in next week for another episode of \"Are you smarter than a supermutant!\""
  nf_ate.41.a:0 "Please, change the station."

  nf_ate.42.t:0 "The New Apex Predator"
  nf_ate.42.d:0 "Although the Jaguar Cult has been broken, something could be salvaged from it. We could make an example of them for the rest of the empire, or perhaps we could grant the survivors a diminished role in our army."
  nf_ate.42.a:0 "The only thing these scum are good for are penal battalions."
  nf_ate.42.b:0 "You have a chance to redeem yourselves. Do not waste it."
  nf_ate.42.b_tt:0 "\n§gAvailable because you spared the Rafael.§!"

  nf_ate.43.t:0 "The Gathering at Xochicalo"
  nf_ate.43.d:0 "The Speaker has gathered the leaders of the Empire together for a conference.  But each of them has its own dreams and hopes.  Yesenia dreams of uniting the empire under her rule.  Ocelotl thinks more power should be granted the the wealthy and powerful in the Empire, and that if they are rewarded, they will support his dream of conquest and a lower marginal tax rate. And Cuauhtli and his jaguar knights dream of an empire where any can rise to the top, including our backwards tribals. \n\n And of course there's Kinkaid, the poor descendant of the Cucarachas."
  nf_ate.43.a:0 "Why can't you all get along and do as I tell you?"
