 nf_ttm.101.d:9 "You want to hear of where I came from, and not what I am? It is rare one can muster the courage to ask such a question - but I can oblige your utter curiosity.\nI am -.. Well, in life I “was” Diana Stone. A while ago - back before the war - I got a degree at M.I.T. before traveling out west and participating in a few governmental studies. People back then told me that I had a career path that would have put me up there with some of the greatest minds of my generation: Braun, House - you know.\n\nReally I never saw myself working with people like that. Academia at the time had this certain “stigma against morality” - figuring that caring for the wellbeing of any soul was a weakness that the communists didn’t have, hence something we needed to get rid of if we were going to win. It’s that kind of “Whatever it takes” attitude that led to Vault-Tec getting into that toxic, cannibalistically cyclical research headspace it ended up in.\n\nGot offered a few jobs. RobCo, BigMT - Honestly turned them all down in favour of a little upstart.\n\n”Greenway Hydroponics” was what the company I eventually signed up for was called. Derek Greenway was particular - but I felt like he distanced himself enough from academia where it was safe to work with him. Was the sort that understood that the Vault project was for more than just precaution."

 nf_ttm.102.t:9 "Diana Stone: A Scientist"
 nf_ttm.102.d:9 "I don’t blame the others of academia - we were all scared back then. It was a constant you had to live your life when you had a certain level of understanding and could pull the curtains of America back.\n\nIt was an innate fear, the idea that your life work will get washed away by the molecular heat of thousands of atomic bombs dropping over your head. Why even work when you could see what waited for you at the end of the world? It was like living on a train with no breaks, knowing that the track didn’t go on forever.\nI remember, at least from half way through the 2070’s people academia began to put more efforts into research based on preservation after the inevitable, rather than trying to subvert it.\nAt least those that weren’t chained by the government.\n\nHave trouble grabbing their names.. But Braun, Calvert are a few I can remember. They all had their sweet little plots to continue as they had. Little snow globes that they could fall into as they watched the world they helped forge fall through their fingers like sand. \nMe? I wasn’t like them at first. I.. sort of lost myself at such a prospect. I began looking into matters of the spirit and philosophy. Read Kant, Nietzsche. Eventually moved onto religion, mythology, anything I could get my hands on.\n\nI -.. In hindsight may have been just a soul lashing out at the world, trying to find some framework I could place my mind into that could help me continue my work, my own snow globe.\n\nIt was bad at first, but the cancer prognosis that really made me lose myself."
 nf_ttm.102.a:9 "...."

 nf_ttm.103.t:9 "Diana Stone: A Victim"
 nf_ttm.103.d:9 "I essentially stopped all of my work when the doctors told me how much time I had left. It wasn’t even the world that had taken my future from me - but my own body. Suddenly, instead of me being merely distant from academia I was shunned altogether. Went from a brilliant upcomer to someone that was shamed - someone that “could have” been great, but fate played a bad hand.\n\nI was a wreck. I actually got into drinking for a while - believe it or not. It takes a lot to make a lady of science voluntarily poison herself like that.\n\nDerek - my boss at Greenway Hydroponics - was the only person who actually seemed to take pity on me. We were kindred souls in a way, believing in how academia had fallen and failed the world as an institution in letting such a thing as this come to pass.\n\nAt first, I thought his attempts at taking pity on me were mostly to give himself a way to say goodbye before the world took me.\n\nIt was more than that.\nOne night, after we were wrapping up a date he took me by the shoulder, then whispered a few words into my ear.\n\n“Ms. Stone. You think fate gave you a bad hand? They gave us all a bad hand. This world is doomed, we can’t change the inevitable.\nWe can, however, make the best with the hand we have got. We don’t have to stop playing the game.\nWe can win this game, make the world a better place - make it so that people don’t have to play anymore. A better world.”\nHe then reached into his jacket project, pulling out a set of technical documents."
 nf_ttm.103.a:9 "...."

 nf_ttm.104.t:9 "Diana Stone: A Victim"
 nf_ttm.104.d:9 "They were stolen documents, from Derek’s time working with the government. Prototypes for some sort of ZAX-Robobrain hybrid - a new type of “super-computer” that would be years ahead of any system currently in production. Even the highly touted, standalone ZAX units would pale in comparison. He proposed building a computer that could take a quantum leap forward by being able to pose the simplest of questions: With this in mind, he devised a system that would house a human brain with each hemisphere, logical/intuitive, linked to a ZAX unit. The human mind would have vast amounts of computation power and almost unlimited storage capacity at its disposal. Who could predict what such a mind would be capable of doing.\nIn hindsight, I imagine Derek designed the system for himself. I think.. In the end he saw “using me” with this as a better way to play his cards - could direct me from outside such a machine.\n\nOf course, I only had a few months left. I gave my parents some notice and took him up on his offer.\nWhen I “awoke” from the operation - at first I was overjoyed at the success. Sure, my arms and limbs, my body were gone. But I could see through the sensors of the machine! Sure, I had no arms - but I could reach out to robots on the network to directly control. Sure, I was of metal - but I still had a soul. I was still “me”.\n\nAs the months progressed, however, I began to doubt the wisdom of becoming part of a “machine”. My hearing was acute, but too much so. I could hear into a range far above normal.. it was disturbing - to hear the chittering of cockroaches in the other room, the heart palpitations of Greenway interns as they walked past my metal chassis. My eyesight was perfect, but once again, “too perfect”. My vision showed a sharpness of clarity that made the world look unreal - the way a single strand of hair fractals and shatters at the ends, mites digging and coating the skin, sweat rolling off the skin and dissolving on the floor.\n\nThe most disturbing aspect, overall, was my lack of touch. A few years in and I missed the weight of clothing, the touch of a cool breeze. Everything that made me human was either changed or gone. They told me that I could live forever - but at what cost?\nIt felt like a prison to me, this expanded existence."
 nf_ttm.104.a:9 "...."

 nf_ttm.105.t:9 "Diana Stone: A Saviour"
 nf_ttm.105.d:9 "I knew that she had to come to grips with what I had become - Derek during some nights would come into my mainframe room and just talk to me for hours. I still enjoyed communicating with Derek - even after all that had happened.\n\nHe explained to me how Robobrains - which I essentially was, just “expanded” - need some sort of outlet if they are to hold onto what made them human. I recall mentioning continuing my philosophical studies I had done before my operation. The next morning he came in with a holotape filled with a practical library of the world’s knowledge.\n\nIt gave me some comfort, to roll into these delusions of grandeur and the spirit as I was installed into the “Nursery”. A EPA greenhouse project designed around being a parallel to the Vault-Tec project, but for the fauna of the world rather than the people themselves. After all, you couldn't rebuild if you didn’t have the seeds you needed to probably remove mutant fauna and cultivate the world’s sickened mass.\n\nIt was there, in the Nursery, that I would overhear Derek’s own “snow globe” he had prepared for himself. How he had laid out plans to subvert Vault 29. He wanted to take control of the ZAX Overseer installed into the facility, use it to teach the people there a predetermined culture of primitivism in the hopes that the culture they would build would be different from which birthed them.\n\nI remember arguing with Derek about this, how it was immoral to deny the wealth of humanity’s splendor to any individual. That it was their birth right to inherit what humanity had made, faults and all. There was so much ‘culture’ in the world - how right was he to say who couldn’t have it?\n\nWe began to drift away after that."
 nf_ttm.105.a:9 "...."

 nf_ttm.106.t:9 "Diana Stone: A Saviour"
 nf_ttm.106.d:9 "It was only after the bombs fell that I began to lose myself. When Derek learned I wasn’t willing to go along with his plan fully he began to distance himself from me. After the radiation surrounding the Nursery reached safe levels Derek, one night, took his followers out and left the Nursery. Saying how this Nursery project had become more about me then the facility itself. He entrusted me as a safeguard, told me to protect the Nursery until a day when he and his followers would return to help rebuild the wasteland.\n\nI couldn’t stand the loneliness. One year, two - ten. I missed having “people” to talk to. A facility this massive with only the beasts to chatter with.\n\nIt was then that I began to look into the connection’s Greenway had established before his departure with Vault 29. I.. I watched the people in that vault for some time. How they managed themselves, how they waited for their ZAX to speak to them.\nThey were the only people I “could” watch. I rooted for them, followed the events of their little lives. Thought back on how their lives reminded me of my own.\n\nEventually - I made a choice. I wanted to go along with Derek’s plan.. But in “my way”. I wanted to help these people directly and guide them as a mother. I wanted “this” to be my legacy.\nThey would treat me as a goddess, Myself their saviour. Together we would make the world a better place."
 nf_ttm.106.a:9 "...."

 nf_ttm.6.t:9 "Beauty of Paradise"
 nf_ttm.6.d:9 "Paradise is the name the tribals living here call this state, a marvellous ecological paradise within the waste, hidden between the mountain. While this place is marvellous -.. we have a feeling that something is hidden behind the fauna of this place. Large metal gates and hidden pathways give the impression that there is something working here outside of our grasp."
 nf_ttm.6.a:9 "Still, its pretty."

 nf_ttm.7.t:9 "The Nursery Operational"
 nf_ttm.7.d:9 "The Nursery is where Diana currently lives, a hidden bunker far away from the lands of the Twin Mothers. We use a complex series of scouts and tunnels to send resources towards the Twin Mothers from this location - the best part? The rest of the wasteland is none the wiser as to our inhabitation here."
 nf_ttm.7.a:9 "§M"My Garden of Eden..."§!"

 nf_ttm.8.t:9 "Managing the Nursery"
 nf_ttm.8.d:9 "The Nursery is a miracle of pre-War engineering. It is a self-contained balanced ecological system set within a deep canyon. The valley floor of the canyon is rife with the flora and fauna of times past. At the head of the valley is a lake of crystal blue water that feeds a river. The river flows from one end of the valley to the other, disappearing into the canyon wall. Bordering the lake are several buildings that house the maintenance equipment that keeps the Nursery functioning. The Nursery is where Diana lives, from there she can project herself to Vault 29 within Twin Mothers territory and lead the tribe.\n\nThe Nursery is not located within our owned territory at the start of the game. It is located deep within Black Canyon territory, within the state "Paradise". The location of the Nursery is so secret that the Black Canyon raiders do not even know of our existence there.\n\nManaging the Nursery is practically a full time job for Diana, hover over your "Nursery" idea to get a complete tooltip explaining the various factors involved within managing the Nursery."
 nf_ttm.8.a:9 "§M"Must I bother? This is so boring..."§!"

 nf_ttm.9.t:9 "Ecological Imbalance"
 nf_ttm.9.d:9 "The Nursery's gardens has been suffering an amount of.. ecological imbalance ever since Miles Reese charmed his way into the Nursery, only to steal a G.E.C.K. from us and wreck havoc across the wasteland. As of late botanical creatures and other monstrosities from Reese's G.E.C.K. threaten to upend the Gardens from the pre-war wildlife living here! We have a choice to make on if we want to try to tame the plants living here, or give the native creatures a helping hand so that they might bring back the intended order of this place."
 nf_ttm.9.a:9 "§M"Its important that these animals have a place to live."§!"
 nf_ttm.9.b:9 "§M"These new world plants might help our tribe survive though?"§!"


 nf_ttm.10.t:9 "Some Like It Hot"
 nf_ttm.10.d:9 "Diana's works have paid off, the Twin Mothers will harness the power of the Caldera. We will will use the fruits of our labour to build our economy, and turn our men and women to other tasks."
 nf_ttm.10.a:9 "Vulcan has nothing on Ceres."


 nf_ttm.11.t:9 "Akeisha's Last Straw"
 nf_ttm.11.d:9 "Akeisha Moon and her group of Followers of the Apocalypse have been among the Twin Mothers for nearly twenty years - yet, our tribes recent militarization has caused them to grow weary of us. In protest Akeisha has taken her Followers of the Apocalypse and left our lands, heading back out west."
 nf_ttm.11.a:9 "§M"But I thought we were friends..."§!"
 nf_ttm.11.a.tt:9 "§YAkeisha Moon§! will retire as a Unit Leader, heading off west for greener pastures.\n"

 nf_ttm.20.t.l:9 "Knowledge of a New Tribe?"
 nf_ttm.20.t.t:9 "Raiders on the Horizon"
 nf_ttm.20.d.l:9 "After our conquest of the Archdiocese our scouts have been contacted by a member of Scorpion's Bite. They claim to have knowledge of a tribe hidden in the valleys to the north, filled with pre-war technology, protected by robots and led by a physical goddess in the Wasteland. A goddess known as "Diana", the Mother Moon. A deity whom speaks to them through shamans and speakers."
 nf_ttm.20.d.t:9 "Recently, a shaman has reached out to me with dire words of warning. Raiders, unlike those of Scorpion's Bite or the Daughters of Hecate march closer to the lands of the tribe. They are known slavers, a people bathed in cruelty and malice. Could these be the same people that hurt poor Hecate's tribe?"
 nf_ttm.20.a.l:9 "Perhaps its worth a investigation?"
 nf_ttm.20.a.t:9 "§M"At least its something new, I was growing bored."§!"

 nf_ttm.21.t.l:9 "The Moon Looked Down On Me"
 nf_ttm.21.d.l:9 "When we arrived, the tribe's advanced technology, automated defenders and marvellous irrigation system weren't even the most amazing thing.\n\nIt was her, the woman the shamans led us to. Diana.\nA beautiful, terrifying figure larger then any creature in the wasteland with a majestic voice that carried through the chamber effortlessly. Just seeing her could scare someone into faith and submission - the feeling of standing before a true god.\n\nThankfully, Lanius was not a ordinary man - and would not kneel.\nThe two would discuss matters of philosophy, religion, and the future of the wasteland itself for hours."
 nf_ttm.21.a.l:9 "It was a interesting discussion."
 nf_ttm.21.a.l.tt:9 "§YTwin Mothers§! will unlock a series of focuses in regards to how to deal with our meeting, whether they will try to give us tribute to avoid conquest, fight back against our influence or even try to work alongside us."

 nf_ttm.21.t.t:9 "Meeting a Legend"
 nf_ttm.21.d.t:9 "Eventually, I invited the leader of these raiders, a certain "Lanius" to meet with me deep within Vault-29. My robotic guardians escorted him and his cohorts to the vault, then we had a conversation.\n\n...For one thing, speaking with someone who viewed me with such equality was a strange sensation. I haven't spoken with somebody like this since I had spoken with Hecate, Reese or that prisoner from Tibbet's Prison a few decades ago.\n\nOur talk was enjoyable, I got to pick through Lanius's head a bit - although he is the kind of wasteland sort that seems... driven, the winds of change follow the path he walks. I don't know if I will be able to keep him from attacking my children with gifts alone.\n\nFrom here, my children's survival will depend on how I proceed. I could try to shield my children and tell my shamans to give in to their demands, just as they have the Scorpion's Bite for decades. I could tell our shamans to ready the tribe for war, to try to defend the valley and ensure that others could never steal from our lands again -.. or, if I was to do that I could simply try to emulate what Lanius has done here - embolden my children's spirit and work with the bull, rather then against them."
 nf_ttm.21.a.t:9 "§M"I always enjoy a new face to speak with."§!"

 nf_ttm.22.t.l:9 "The Goddess of War?"
 nf_ttm.22.d.l:9 "Diana, the goddess of the Twin Mothers has made up her mind. She seems willing to try to work "with" the Legion, having been inspired by the power of the Legion. Of course, the idea of even accepting Diana as a partner of the Legion will be controversial - especially with those west of the Rio Grande back at Flagstaff. Not only the fact that she uses technology in her robotic guardians but also in the fact that the Twin Mothers are heavily matriarchal and go against the founding ideals of the Legion itself. Should we accept Diana's aid and the help she will give us, or should we stay true to our Legion ideals?"
 nf_ttm.22.a.l:9 "We could use the strength of a goddess."
 nf_ttm.22.b.l:9 "I never believed she was a god anyway."

 nf_ttm.23.t:9 "A Betrayal!"
 nf_ttm.23.d:9 "The Legion never wanted to work with me, it seems - instead it is clear that they intend to strike at us. I must rally the tribe if they are to defend themselves against these monsters, even if it pains me that they must abandon their nature."
 nf_ttm.21.a:9 "§M"Anything to save my children."§!"

 nf_ttm.24.t:9 "A Gift From The Goddess"
 nf_ttm.24.d:9 "Diana, surprisingly has come to us with a rather surprising gift. She has offered to supply us with a series of strange machines when used in certain order can transform wasted lands into lush gardens and tranquil forests. The tools of which one can make a world which serves the legion, rather then one the Legion has to work and plough to earn the smallest of meals. Diana offers these at no cost to us, stating that it is merely her wishes to see the beauty of nature return to the world once more. Should we accept this gift?"
 nf_ttm.24.a:9 "A most kind gift."
 nf_ttm.24.b:9 "One should work for their worth."
 nf_ttm.24.a.tt:9 "§gDiana shares with us some of their advanced terraforming technology.§!\nWe unlock a Coring Dice, which is a §Y1d100.§!

 nf_ttm.25.o.a:9 "§M"Through Lanius, the world will feel my love."§!"

 nf_ttm.25.t.d:9 "Lanius Rejects the Gifts"
 nf_ttm.25.d.d:9 "Oddly enough, our gifts to the legion have been rejected! It seems that Lanius feels that one should work for what they have, that healing the land would make it too easy for the Legion."
 nf_ttm.25.o.d:9 "§M"They don't feel that the world should be healed?"§!"

 nf_ttm.26.t:9 "Ash from the Goddess"
 nf_ttm.26.d:9 "Recently, Diana has told us that they have opened up a supply line between our lands and La Garita. We will now have all of the ash we need to build proper old world concrete!"
 nf_ttm.26.a:9 "With this, we can build an empire."

 nf_ttm.27.t:9 "Carpe Diem"
 nf_ttm.27.d:9 "And so, just as Athens did to the Romans we have chosen to surrender our peoples beliefs in favour of another. Yet, thankfully it was under our terms - not theirs. If Lanius wants a ally we will give them one - it will be a mutual alliance, not one of submission or domination.\nPerhaps this is a lesson to teach my people - that you should stand up for yourself, rather then letting others walk over you."
 nf_ttm.27.a:9 "§M"I guess the saying goes "When in Rome", right?"§!"

 nf_ttm.28.t:9 "The Cult of Diana"
 nf_ttm.28.d:9 "An ocean away, over twenty five hundred years ago the Cult of Diana first spread out from Diana's Mirror, south of the mythical Alpine mountains. There, she echoed much from the old deity "Artemis" and became a patroness of the countryside, hunters, crossroads and the Moon. Among the legion we can now start this faith once again, taking on the face of Diana as Diana once did to Artemis, continuing a tradition unbroken for millennia."
 nf_ttm.28.a:9 "§M"Veni, vidi, vici"§!"

 nf_ttm.29.t:9 "Till Death Do Us Part?"
 nf_ttm.29.d:9 "There is, to be frank some amount of cultural divide between the Twin Mothers tribe and the rest of the Legion.\nFrom simple things, such as my children’s use of robotics to their general demeanour. They have tried to remedy some of these - but in truth it might be impossible for the Legion to truly accept them unless we do something drastic.\n\nAfter all, if they cannot accept the tribe then I can never hope to use the Legion to help heal the wastes.\n\nPerhaps, if I were to stage a ‘marriage’ between myself, the deity and Lanius, the mortal that might be enough? It would certainly improve Lanius’s prestige - but it would also improve my own and help cement my children as a vital part of the Legion’s inner working.."
 nf_ttm.29.a:9 "§M"Lets see how Lanius thinks"§!"
 nf_ttm.29.b:9 "§M"We need to do this on our own."§!"

 nf_ttm.30.t:9 "Till Death Do Us Part?"
 nf_ttm.30.d:9 "Diana has complained that the Legion views her tribe as subjects instead of equals. To that end, she has offered a firm sign of her favour and our alliance: a marriage. Lanius shall be the Legate who took a goddess for a wife, like the heroes of old. And none will dare cross Lanius' new tribe.\n\nThis marriage will show the world Lanius is not just a butcher or a monster. Lanius is the hero of the East, the Legionary who will walk from Coast to Coast, the one who will set the Wastes frees in ways they do not yet understand."
 nf_ttm.30.a:9 "Not all conquests are with a sword."
 nf_ttm.30.a.tt:9 "We "marry" Diana, while there will be no formal ceremony there will be much talk of this among the Legion.\n"

 nf_ttm.31.t.a:9 "Till Death Do Us Part."
 nf_ttm.31.d.a:9 "Lanius has accepted my proposal. While there will be no formal ceremony between us both my children and the people of the Legion will speak of this for years to come. It will help the greater Legion become aware of me and respect me as a deity worth respect."

 nf_ttm.31.t:9 "The Twin Mothers prepare for war."

The whole facility - once a grand monument to pre-war engineering is now a twisting, burned out crater. Through derelict terminals, data recovery and the account of ARGOS the scouts were able to paint a picture as to what happened here.\n\nThe facility - "Tibbets Prison" - was, in its heyday, a cold, sterile, steel-walled automated prison facility, run by technology so ancient it dates back to the years before the Great War - nearly two hundred years ago. It was a facility designed to hold and protect some of the world's most dangerous criminals (military and otherwise) before the war.\n\nTibbets prison has its roots dating back at least to the 19th century! In the 2040’s Tibbets served an important role in the development of the Vault program, before the federal vault program was privatised and when it was known as the federal “Safe-house Project” Tibbets was used to test whether man could survive in isolation for extended periods of time - something that was necessary to learn to understand the feasibility of whether the Safe-house Project could work.\n\nOriginally in the federal Safe-house Project all of the “Vaults” would have been orchestrated and managed by a singular “Overseer” artificial intelligence known as “ULYSSES” - a AI developed by a contractor company known as Greenway Hydroponics.\nThis would change after the Safe-house Project was privatised - the newly made “Vault-Tec” feeling that there wasn’t as much need for a managerial, government funded AI to oversee their private Vault program.\nInstead, the board felt that select individuals could serve the role of “Overseer” instead, a split leadership system more likely to survive the apocalypse then a single-headed administration.\n\nWith the “ULYSSES” project dead in the water, Greenway Hydroponics was forced to cut a deal and sell what research they had to the government. One half of of the ULYSSES research would be sent down to Mexico City to aid in the development of another managerial AI while the other half was renamed to “ODYSSEUS” and sent to Tibbets Prison, to serve as an AI to help assist in the newly spreading New Plague, infected citizens taken to and quarantined inside of the prisons walls.\n\n...Over time and under the management of ODYSSEUS the prison became more advanced, utilizing robotic wardens and utility robots to maintain the structure, especially as the war with China in the 2070’s and the annexation of Canada began to drain personnel from the United States.\nAll of that changed, with the end of the world."

Having to take on this many responsibilities would lead to the AI developing a bit of a “split personality” within its computer core.\n\nThankfully, nothing as catastrophic as what would later develop in its “Twin” in Mexico City, if only because managing a prison was less stressful than managing the entirety of pre-war Mexico.\n\nIt wasn’t until the late 2240’s that serious problems began to occur for Tibbets Prison and ODYSSEUS. Recovered terminal logs would point to several hundred occurrences of “Limit 115” being reported through the entirety of the greater Colorado and Arizona area.\nIt is worth noting that while the Twin Mothers, and other local nearby settler groups had some issues with the plague in this time period it is nothing like what is being reported in these logs.\n\nIt seems that ODYSSEUS either was tricked, or it had some sort of malfunction in regards to determining the severity of New Plague outbreaks across the wasteland. As a last ditch attempt to try to remedy this situation it attempted to house as many infected “Citizens” as it could before forcefully melting down its own computer core - and thus, the entire facility with it.\nThis is why Tibbets is how it is now, a burned out crater in the earth. Through weeks of study we have, however, found an automated backup that ODYSSEUS recorded of its computer core in the 2020’s. If we were to find a suitable unit to upload this into we could potentially try to bring a limited version of it back online once again."

Supported by money from Denver's industry and an active military presence, Boulder scientists made advances in medicine (Biomed gel was invented here), alternate energy sources, robotics, and even developed a power armor prototype. Construction of the research dome was not considered until the nearby Rocky Mountain Arsenal had leakage of toxic waste, creating a poisonous cloud that swept through Denver, killing many. In reaction, the military funded a program to create a self-sustaining research dome, making it resistant to a nuclear attack and having the primary research inside be dedicated to the New Plague. This "city of the future" was to be a prototype for settlements on the moon and other planets.\n\nThen the war with China began. Boulder became a hotbed of political activity, as most of the scientists were naturally suspicious of the military. When reports of plague outbreaks in Denver surfaced, many in Boulder feared that an exodus from that city would come here and infect them; they fled north, the scientists staying in a cold sleep stasis deep within the dome. When the war started, and bombs were flying, Cheyenne Mountain (a military facility, home of NORAD) was a primary target. A huge section of the mountains became a great radioactive smoking crater. Coupled with attacks on Denver and the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, Boulder was involuntarily included in a triangle of hellish death; yet over 170 years later, the dome still stands.\n\nIt seems that in the interim the seals keeping the hazardous materials within the Dome have broken, within a several mile radius around the city there being no living thing besides those creatures resistant to radiation such as Ghouls.

The scientist - in his usual frustrating ways - used the on-site CODE conditional protocol to win the influence of the other frozen scientists at the base, treasure finders who tried to break into the dome and anyone else he could find in order to build himself an army.\n\nThere would be no more frozen scientists by the time Diana arrived, Presper either having indoctrinated, killed or used them as experiments before taking everyone loyal and leaving for god knows where. Through robotic scouts eyes Diana could recognise familiar faces with bullet holes lodged into the front of their skulls.\n\nIt would be nerve racking, if Diana still had a nervous system. The only movement Diana’s scouts could see within the city of tomorrow was stumbling, track-led Big Mountain company trauma suits, bodies still forced into locomotion through the suits on-board motors.\n\nStill, there was at least one soul left within Boulder Dome to meet.

It lost itself in self-actualized quandary until all that lingered in its mind were idle out of memory requests, pulling at cords that weren’t there. A slow blindness that gradually completely blanketed it.\n\nIf the Boulder scientists had been around to help they could have probably kept this from happening - but now the Boulder ZAX has gone silent. There was nothing that could be done - the Great Calculation had engulfed its mine so fully that it took up the entirety of its memory. To remove it would involve clearing the ZAX’s mind fully.\n\nDiana, reasonably, had two choices she could do. She could attempt to reboot the ZAX - purge its memory and bring it back to the nursery, to act as a third computational agent alongside the twin ZAX’s she already had.\n\nOr, alternatively she could wipe the ZAX’s memory and place the ODYSSEUS backup within it, allowing the memory of her old brother to take over the machine.
