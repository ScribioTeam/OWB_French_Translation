  PIPBOY_PLUS_CHANGELOG_TITLE_UPDATE_2_1_0:0 "Update 2.1"
  PIPBOY_PLUS_CHANGELOG_TEXT_UPDATE_2_1_0:0 "§YAdded§! \n- Added 13 new unique focus trees and 6 new puppet trees. \n- In Utah, to the south you can experience a struggle between the three giants of the area in New Caanan, the White Legs and the Eighties. Here you can see several fan favorite characters appear such as Ulysses, Salt-Upon-Wounds and a certain ex-Legionary turned Burned Man. To the north experience a smaller scale story as Heaven’s Gate gradually spread their influence across the southern river bank and the robotic reformers from Murtaugh, the lordly vaulters from Lord’s Anointed, the pious men from High Chapel and the Glassmakers in New Hammond all try to deal with this new threat. \n- In Oregon experience a chaotic king of the hill battle to find out who is on top! In addition to an entirely new tree for Troll Warren the mind controlled followers of Mesmeralda in the Marrow Drinkers, the followers of the great M’lulu in the Mirelurk Tribe, the faithful of the Ruddy Man in the Apostles and the many different faces of the Bonedancer Tribe can all duke it out to see who can rule the north. Expect backstabbing, alliances and simple conquest to rule the day in this hellish warzone. \n- Added new Caps mechanic to the mod. This brings with it a Unit limiter in the form of caps cost per unit and a small market for you to buy equipment from. This also comes with a new gamerule that allows you to enable/disable it if you wish. Tutorial event at game start for patch 2.1.0, as well as a guide in the pipboy “Mechanics” section. This is mainly to serve as a balancing tool to help out with Legion and NCR and will not impact minors too much negatively. \n- Completely overhauled our current set of government ideas and policies. In addition to the base conscription law there are now conscription laws unique to Raiders, Tribals, the Brotherhood, the Legion, Mexico and the Troll Warren! \n- Added Followers of the Apocalypse as a decision/event system for nations to deal with. They might cause you to go mad but that seems to be part of their charm. This also comes with a new gamerule that allows you to enable/disable it if you wish. \n- Added slavery system! Certain nations, those with slavery enabled, will capture slaves during conquests/wars. Slaves impact events and production of the country. \n- Added custom ingame achievements for players to strive for when playing Old World Blues. See Pipboy for further instructions. \n- Added a fancy new login screen for the patch! \n- Added a custom Pantheon scripted GUI system for Utah minors, praise the sun! \n- Overhauled General traits system with new Fallout Traits. \n- Added decisions for dealing with Area 51 if you own it. Pretty wacky stuff. Included a gamerule if you don’t like it. \n- Added new mainline unit types! Molerats, used by the Brain for Vault City, and Mirelurks, used by the Mirelurk tribe and Apostles. Mole Rats have higher entrenchment then normal divisions while Mirelurks have higher armor from their tough shells! Nightkin are also available as an exclusive unit ( For now ) for the Troll Warren! \n- Added a formable to allow west coast mutants to relive the glory of the Master’s Army. \n- Added a formable for settler countries who take out Broken Coast to help them consolidate the region against raiders. \n- Added two new nations to the map in Oregon. Carcass Walkers, a small no-man’s land territory and the Timberline, a player suggested country! \n- Added several releasable countries inside of the Eighties territory. Two of which, the Protectron Security Hub and the Noemen Tribe are player suggested countries! \n- Added several new leaders to certain nations so they have some flavor at the start of the game. Twin Mothers, Haida, Bellingham, Jackals, Vipers, Yakuza Territories and Grabber Territories being some of them. A few of these countries even have additional ideas to better reflect their flavor! \n- Added a new vault country to Utah known as the Timekeepers. They have a rather wacky gamerule you can use with them as well! \n- Added a new modifier to coring called coring efficiency to allow submodders/us to increase/decrease coring cost for specific states/nations. \n- Added several new decisions to develop certain things around the map such as powerplants. \n- Added in a new terrain type called Radiation. \n- Added in a whole new batch of Downfall events. \n- Added several new models for Units and Buildings. \n- Added over thirty new focus icons across all focus trees! \n- Added Assault Carbine as Tier 3 ballistic weapon for NCR and NCR states. \n- Added Multiple Cosmetic weapons for Whitelegs. \n- Added Handmade Rifle as a Tier 2 ballistic and Type 93 Rifle for Tier 3 ballistic for Shi. \n- Added Chinese Officer Sword as a Tier 3 cosmetic for Shi. \n- Added Custom Tier 2 ballistic weapon for Santa Anna, Republic of the Rio Grande, and Maximilian. \n- Added Custom 9MM Tier 1 ballistic weapon for Cartels. \n- Added Brush Gun for Tier 2 ballistic for Desert Rangers. \n- Added new generic Special Forces equipment. \n- Added BOS Special Forces cosmetic equipment. \n- Added Ranger Special Forces cosmetic equipment (NCR, Baja & Desert). \n- Added Shi Special Forces cosmetic equipment. \n- Added Enclave Special Forces cosmetic equipment (only for NCR Enclave currently). \n- Added a whole lot of custom Mojave chapter cosmetics. \n- Added BOS cosmetics for Tier 1 laser equipment, Tier 4 melee \n- Added Tier 2 melee cosmetic for Crazy Horse. \n- Added Katana cosmetic to Yakuza. \n- Added Raider Power Armour cosmetic to Iron Alliance. \n- Added Washington Brotherhood Tier 4 melee. \n- Added TAA Custom weapons. \n- Added new sounds for choosing a research and completing one. \n- Complete Overhaul to the Scavenging system. \n\n§YChanged§! \n- Heaven’s Gate, having mastered the use of their AER steam cores now starts the game as Advanced. In addition several of their focuses have been heavily buffed to help them compete with their strengthened neighbors. \n- The Ghouls of Bellingham are now more willing to defend their city from invaders. Bellingham now starts the game as a Ghoul nation. \n- Rebalanced Broken Coast focus costs and effects. Now Broken Coast’s AI will have the potential of actually completing its focus tree! \n- Rebalanced Vault City’s tree. They get less wargoals now - but have several options to either attack New Reno or join one of the many factions in the Wasteland. \n- To account for Troll Warren’s new tree the Washington Brotherhood has received a small rework of their tree. They will have a series of escalating hostile decisions they can take against the Warren before going to war with them! \n- Made Tohono, Navajo, and Gente del Sol long term trading partners of the Legion. \n- Yakama Nation and a new country, the Olympus Tribe now start at war with the Washington Brotherhood. They fill the role that the Isaquah nation once did. \n- The Washington Brotherhood now starts at peace with The Cause. They get a wargoal shortly into their tree to attack The Cause now. \n- Redid bookmark menu for the West Coast to highlight nations with new content/changes. \n- Changed Immersive Terrain from actual terrain to just images on those states victory points. \n- Overhauled terrain map to better approximate elevation. \n- Super Mutant baseline stats have been adjusted to account for Warren’s new tree. \n- Super Mutant Behemoths now count as special forces. This was partly done so that we could increase their strength to better reflect their capabilities in lore. ( They will now also benefit from the special forces category as well ) \n- Revised Legion focus tree to reflect the wars in Utah. \n- Revised the Great Khans focus tree to move them away from a Utah warpath. \n- Added new focus icon’s to Rosado’s tree, because she’s your favorite. \n- Changed base game friendship loc so it makes more sense for the ways we use it. \n- Changed Arroyo so the Chosen One stays as the country leader if they join the Brotherhood of Steel. \n- Added loc to the custom faction tooltip shown on hover over so it doesn't read just strings and gives a proper explanation of what each is. \n- Added the Itza and the Aztlan to the list of protected war countries, to hopefully protect them from a random Chico annexation. \n- Some countries, for lore reasons, will now always refuse stolen territory demands from some or all nations. \n\n§YFixed§! \n- Fixed a issue where the Rio Chapter wouldn't spawn for the Republic of the Rio Grande. \n- Fixed Tlaloc's Children being able to gain two doctrines by having Tlaloc take a doctrine other than automatic warfare and then when they spawn they automatically get automatic warfare researched. \n- Fixed Lucius not being available as a minister/high command due to it using the BOM tag. \n- Fixed a bunch of equipment/technology icons without drop shadow. \n- Fixed some latent 3D and shader effect bugs. \n\n§YRemoved§! \n- Removed Pharohs from the map. Replaced with a moved High Chapel ( Perhaps they might come back in the future? ) \n- Removed Delta from the map, replaced with Timekeepers. \n- Removed Bonepickers from the map, replaced with the Apostles ( The Bonepickers still exist in the Apostles backstory though! ) \n- Removed Ires from the map, replaced with the Lord’s Anointed. \n- Removed Isaquah and replaced them with Olympus Tribe, The Yakama Nation and Olympus Tribe now fill the role that they once did in the early Washington Brotherhood war. \n- Removed the New Canaan conversion mechanic."

(Bryce Canyon is within Tar Walker territory.) \n- Countries may now join the Mormon Alliance without bordering them if they have a Mormon mission. \n- Set up New Canaan to randomly select a game rule path if the 'Default' game rule is selected with historical settings disabled - bringing it in line with other nations. \n- New Canaan will now prioritize responding to threat over other focuses, and will prefer focuses requiring higher threat levels when available. \n- New Canaan will prioritize pulling neighboring tribals into their sphere of influence more strongly in their focus prioritization. \n- New Canaan AI will now attempt to send actual volunteers to nations with Mormon missions following completion of 'Provide Direct Assistance'. \n- New Canaan's response to the Followers will now influence how nations in their sphere of influence will respond as well. \n- New Canaan's 'Draw a Line in the Sand' focus is more dynamic, and will change to reflect changing borders. \n- New Canaan's 'Fortify the South' focus is more dynamic, and will change to reflect changing borders. \n- New Canaan's 'Bring the War to the White Legs' now bypasses if New Canaan already owns or is allied with the White Legs. \n- New Canaan's 'Aid the Tribes' focus now requires them to have at least one puppet. \n- New Canaan will now cancel all active guarantees when they go into exile. \n- White Legs will now generally take focuses integrating conquests before taking new wargoal focuses. \n- White Legs will now avoid the second part of their focus tree until they've completed their opening conquests unless no other focus options are available. \n- White Legs will much more frequently attack the Crazy Horns before New Canaan if the Crazy Horns aren't guaranteed or allied. \n- White Legs now produce New Canaan threat by manually justifying wars as well, with varying amounts depending on the nation type and relationship to New Canaan.

More work may be done on this at a later date. \n- Uintah was marked as a settler nation instead of a tribal one, and given civilized tech - because they are not Fallout-style tribals but an actual Native American group.
