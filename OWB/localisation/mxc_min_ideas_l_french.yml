 MXC_backbone_desc:0 "Colorado wasn't known for its infrastructure before the war. After the bombs dropped and 200 years of degradation, the roads are yet another victim with the fall of America. There won't be golden roads leading to Maxson Bunker, but at the very least we can stop some of the foot pain while on patrol."

I trust our reclamation teams will do their best to stop our heritage from being lost to time. In the mean time, i'm going to make sure there won't be a lack of beam weapons. Now hand me that screwdriver.\" "
 MXC_envoy:0 "Maddox Conley"
 MXC_envoy_desc:0 "When the Maxson Chapter fought the Hangdogs, they learned that the wastes would always have the advantage. Even with the strongest armour and biggest gun, it won't do anything if no one is around to use it. Allowing promising wastelanders to join our ranks or atleast work along side us will keep Roger Maxson's dream alive."

They don't know they can be something greater than just a farmhand or a raider. With a bit of knowledge and meeting them halfway, they could start to help more than just themselves.\" "
