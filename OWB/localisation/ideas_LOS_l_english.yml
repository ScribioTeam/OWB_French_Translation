  los_the_church_of_the_lost_desc: "The Church of the Lost is the religion of the ghouls living within Los. Its followers try to follow a path towards achieving "Perfect Wisdom" - hoarding secrets and relics of the past so that they can be protected and used to achieve this state of perfect wisdom.\nAt one point, under Blake this church also practised values promoting Ghoul supremacy over humans - under the new leadership of Sappho those tendencies have been marginalized in favour of a individual path one can take to wisdom, rather then one that requires the subjugation of others."
