  ces_death_in_the_canyons:0 "The Janus Face of Caesar"
  ces_death_in_the_canyons_desc:0 "Caesar's mercy after a battle was as renowned as his brutality during it.

For every tribe who lost their name, there was a town that blossomed under the Arizona sun."

  ces_the_malpais_legate:0 "The Malpais Legate"
  ces_the_malpais_legate_desc:0 "Joshua Graham, the Malpais Legate, was the co-founder of the Legion, and Caesar's greatest servant. A shrewd, cunning general - an early act cemented his legend across the Legion, and formed the basis of his military prowess."

  ces_caesar_son_of_mars_desc:0 "Caesar's will is law. He is a god amongst men, the son of the god of war, Mars. All in his legion live to serve him, as a blade serves his master. He is the teacher and master of the tribes under him - and in his conquest, taught them many lessons."

  ces_caesar_the_godslayer:0 "Caesar the Godslayer"
  ces_caesar_the_godslayer_desc:0 "Caesar will teach the Twin Mothers their final lesson. Their goddess is nothing more than an illusion - and can be slain. With their tribe broken and enslaved, they will be chained to Caesar's will - and used as healers for the Legion."

  ces_deconstructing_perfection:0 "Deconstructing Perfection"
  ces_deconstructing_perfection_desc:0 "With all the salvaged power armour parts we have gained from defeating the Mojave Brotherhood, we can potentially construct our own power armour with greater ease, though the use of servos is still a mystery to us."

  ces_new_judea_desc:0 "The Rome of old once conquered the province of Judea - then Israel, where Christianity was born. The Mormons, building a New Canaan in Utah, seem to be inviting a New Judea upon themselves."

  ces_the_white_leg_petition:0 "The White Legs"
  ces_the_white_leg_petition_desc:0 "The White Legs, a nearby tribe, have come to our attention. Perhaps we can extend them our support in exchange for attacking potential threats in Utah. And should they fail . . . we can always find more tribals."

  ces_graham_execution:0 "The Conquest of New Canaan"
  ces_graham_execution_desc:0 "With the conquest of New Canaan, the Legion's influence extends throughout much of Utah.  Al that is left is mopping up whatever remains. It's not as if the Canaanites can hide in some valley, rally under some outsider's influence, and drive our proxies out, right?"

  ces_new_cohort:0 "New Cohort"
  ces_new_cohort_desc:0 "The White Legs have loyally served us in the war, defeating the New Canaanites and delivering Graham to us. They will be welcomed into the Legion, and granted dominion over Utah."

  ces_cowboy_country_desc: "Caesar has gathered his most trustworthy warriors to make the final decision."

  ces_friendship: "Fors Iuvat Audentes"

  ces_two_conquest_cow: "A Lumine Motus"
  ces_two_conquest_cow_desc: "Will Faster and his racers have served the legion dutifully for many years and there loyalty is unquestioned.

  ces_gdh_take_shore: "Ubi Proxima Merces"
  ces_gdh_take_shore_desc: "The Generalissimo has made us an offer we simply can not refuse, a fleet capable of challenging the NCR's dominance over the Gulf, a project for which he  is going to require the production capabilities of the  ports of [444.GetName]."

  ces_upgrade_port: "The Navy of the Bull"
  ces_upgrade_port_desc: "No matter the owner, [444.Getname] must become Legion's forward navy base. If we can challenge the NCR's position in Baja, it will surely stagger their strategic position up the river."

  # Mexico sub-tree
  ces_mexico_expansion:0 "Mexican Expansion"
  ces_mexico_expansion_desc:0 "South of Caesar's territory is the land of Mexico. It is a prime point of expansion, with many weak tribes and nations. Should the Legion's army find themselves in Mexico, their conquest would be easy."

  ces_open_the_lucky_38:0 "Break The Bank"
  ces_open_the_lucky_38_desc:0 "The Lucky 38 stands tall, watching over the Strip. Inside, Mr House must have housed many treasures and, as it has not been opened since before the war, much pre-war technology."

  ces_divide_et_impera_desc:0 "Divide Et Impera, or 'divide and conquer' - is the principle of dividing a larger power into smaller powers, in order to better conquer or rule over the parts. By attacking key areas of the NCR, we can weaken them enough to be more easily conquered."

  ces_thesis:0 "The New Thesis"

  ces_legion_salvagers_desc:0 "Dog City is a remarkable place, filled to the brim with relics untouched by fearful tribals, or protected by packs of savage hounds who have been and bred here for over a hundred years.

  ces_enslave_hangdogs_desc:0 "Here and there, among the hills and in the deep places of Dog City, small groups of diehard Hangdogs dare to defy us. We must break the will of their men, we shall separate the mother from the child, and in the name of the Legion these dogs shall be taught to kneel."

  ces_slaves_to_flagstaff_desc:0 "From all across the Four States, and beyond, the come to us. Shackled and bound, broken in spirit and mind. We shall give them purpose again, they shall work for the greatest force in the wasteland, or they shall die trying to resist it."

What better place for a Legion outpost than a den of wickedness?"

  ces_slaves_in_phoenix:0 "Slaves in Phoenix"

  ces_two_sun_tribute_desc:0 "The City of Two Sun fought us for their freedom, and even now? They possess some of it. We do not garrison them unless absolutely necessary, and in exchange?

  ces_two_sun_warcamp:0 "Two Sun Warcamp"
  ces_two_sun_warcamp_desc:0 "The Legion does not have a permanent base within the City of Two Sun, to remind these people that they live under our thumb, so in response Caesar ordered the construction of a massive military camp less than a mile from the city. It is here our tributes are delivered, and it is here that numerous warriors are trained in the art of war."

  ces_enslave_tribals:0 "Enslave Tribals"
  ces_enslave_tribals_desc:0 "The people of Two Sun are relatively safe from Legionary conscription, yet the tribals who were under their protection are ours to claim now. The Tombwalkers, the Sun Hunters, and the Roadrunners shall be absorbed into the legion, and form the heart of a new cohort."

But Lucius knows that the Legion's home is Arizona; and with the guidance of the Legion, they shall thrive."

  ces_tank_weapons:0 "The Cataphracts"
  ces_tank_weapons_desc:0 "What better weapon is there to fuel our conquest than armoured vehicles? Under Caesar, their usefulness has been grossly underestimated, and their production cast aside in favour of more... 'heroic' equipment such as machetes and armor for the infantry.

It was the lines of food and water that nearly broke the Legion's strength... and the lack of tribals near that cursed city.  What I felt in that struggle, I felt as I saw the map of the West. The West is a trap. The bear has already been caught in it, and it is dying. Our future lies to the east. \n\nThe Republic shall keep their Old World gate this day, I shall return East.
