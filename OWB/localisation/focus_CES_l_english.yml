  ces_death_in_the_canyons:0 "The Janus Face of Caesar"
  ces_death_in_the_canyons_desc:0 "Caesar's mercy after a battle was as renowned as his brutality during it.

  ces_the_malpais_legate:0 "The Malpais Legate"

  ces_caesar_son_of_mars_desc:0 "Caesar's will is law. He is a god amongst men, the son of the god of war, Mars. All in his legion live to serve him, as a blade serves his master. He is the teacher and master of the tribes under him - and in his conquest, taught them many lessons."

  ces_caesar_the_godslayer:0 "Caesar the Godslayer"
  ces_caesar_the_godslayer_desc:0 "Caesar will teach the Twin Mothers their final lesson. Their goddess is nothing more than an illusion - and can be slain. With their tribe broken and enslaved, they will be chained to Caesar's will - and used as healers for the Legion."

  ces_deconstructing_perfection_desc:0 "With all the salvaged power armour parts we have gained from defeating the Mojave Brotherhood, we can potentially construct our own power armour with greater ease, though the use of servos is still a mystery to us."

  ces_the_white_leg_petition:0 "The White Legs"
  ces_the_white_leg_petition_desc:0 "The White Legs, a nearby tribe, have come to our attention. Perhaps we can extend them our support in exchange for attacking potential threats in Utah. And should they fail . . . we can always find more tribals."

  ces_graham_execution:0 "The Conquest of New Canaan"
  ces_graham_execution_desc:0 "With the conquest of New Canaan, the Legion's influence extends throughout much of Utah.  Al that is left is mopping up whatever remains. It's not as if the Canaanites can hide in some valley, rally under some outsider's influence, and drive our proxies out, right?"

  ces_new_cohort:0 "New Cohort"

  ces_a_worthy_foe_desc:0 "For the first time, the Legion has encountered a foe perhaps more powerful than itself, and the first foe that Caesar is ideologically opposed to. The NCR is, indeed, a worthy foe for Caesar's fledgling Legion."

  ces_divide_et_impera_desc:0 "Divide Et Impera, or 'divide and conquer' - is the principle of dividing a larger power into smaller powers, in order to better conquer or rule over the parts. By attacking key areas of the NCR, we can weaken them enough to be more easily conquered."

  ces_camp_searchlight:0 "Camp Searchlight"
  ces_camp_searchlight_desc:0 "Vulpes Inculta has come to us with a plan. The NCR Camp in the town of Searchlight could easily be sabotaged by opening some irradiated barrels of nuclear waste inside the town, irradiating the town and the NCR soldiers within."

  ces_battle_of_nipton:0 "Battle Of Nipton"
  ces_battle_of_nipton_desc:0 "The town of Nipton, though only small, could prove an extremely important strategic point to launch assaults on the NCR in Mojave. By expending some manpower to take it, we can seize the town as a base across the Colorado."

  ces_legion_salvagers_desc:0 "Dog City is a remarkable place, filled to the brim with relics untouched by fearful tribals, or protected by packs of savage hounds who have been and bred here for over a hundred years.

  ces_enslave_hangdogs_desc:0 "Here and there, among the hills and in the deep places of Dog City, small groups of diehard Hangdogs dare to defy us. We must break the will of their men, we shall separate the mother from the child, and in the name of the Legion these dogs shall be taught to kneel."

  ces_flagstaff_fort:0 "Flagstaff Fortress"
  ces_flagstaff_fort_desc:0 "The Legion is a machine, it takes in weak things and spits out mighty things. Boys become men, men become soldiers, soldiers become heroes, heroes become legends. But before this can happen? Our Legionaries will require weapons."

  ces_slaves_to_flagstaff_desc:0 "From all across the Four States, and beyond, the come to us. Shackled and bound, broken in spirit and mind. We shall give them purpose again, they shall work for the greatest force in the wasteland, or they shall die trying to resist it."

  ces_settlers_in_phoenix_desc:0 "Water is a precious thing in the wasteland, and in Arizona, we have so little. Almost all of it flows to one place, through one series of rivers.

What better place for a Legion outpost than a den of wickedness?"

One can only hope this effort remains once those dreams are crushed."

  ces_two_sun_tribute:0 "Two Sun Tribute"
  ces_two_sun_tribute_desc:0 "The City of Two Sun fought us for their freedom, and even now? They possess some of it. We do not garrison them unless absolutely necessary, and in exchange?

  ces_two_sun_warcamp:0 "Two Sun Warcamp"
  ces_two_sun_warcamp_desc:0 "The Legion does not have a permanent base within the City of Two Sun, to remind these people that they live under our thumb, so in response Caesar ordered the construction of a massive military camp less than a mile from the city.

  ces_enslave_tribals:0 "Enslave Tribals"
  ces_enslave_tribals_desc:0 "The people of Two Sun are relatively safe from Legionary conscription, yet the tribals who were under their protection are ours to claim now. The Tombwalkers, the Sun Hunters, and the Roadrunners shall be absorbed into the legion, and form the heart of a new cohort."

  ces_new_mexico_highways_desc:0 "The people's of New Mexico were slow to kneel, and travel through this place is rough even for our best warriors and outrunners. If trade is to flourish, and if our armies are to move swiftly through these places, we shall need more roads."

  ces_fort_construction:0 "Fort Construction"

  ces_lucius_wall:0 "The Commonwealth"
  ces_lucius_wall_desc:0 "The Legion has never been an empire or a tool of oppression. It was always an army held in common for the people of the Wastes.

But Lucius knows that the Legion's home is Arizona; and with the guidance of the Legion, they shall thrive."

  ces_the_academy:0 "The Academy"
  ces_the_academy_desc:0 "It seems like our kind and caring words have had much more effect than we initially expected on the NCR populace. Multiple scientists, fed up with NCR interference and lack of clear support, have decided against burning their research and material like most others. Instead they have put it at our disposition in exchange for preferential treatment. We shall put this to good use."
  ces_justice:0 "Aequitas"
  ces_justice_desc:0 "Under [CES.GetLeader], the best way to imagine justice is a field that does not slant to either side. [CES.GetLeader] focuses on fairness, moderation, and even liberality, so that the meanest subject can challenge the richest merchant. This compares well to the NCR. "

  ces_searchlight_raid:0 "Raid Camp Searchlight"
  ces_searchlight_raid_desc:0 "Camp Searchlight is a major NCR military base, but the convoys to the supply the outpost are vulnerable to attack. And we've also learned of nuclear waste stored within the camp, which could devastate the occupants if we were to release it. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make."
  ces_cult_vulcan:0 "The Cult of Vulcan"

  ces_utah_conquer_desc:0 "We have long had an influence in Utah, raiding, slaving, and trading. Indeed, based on casual discussions with members of the Legion one might think we actually ruled much of Utah! In practice, our hegemony has been nominal. Let us start to fix that."

  ces_reservation_slaves:0 "Slaves for the Workshops"

  CES_lanius_rules_desc:0 "Lucius, Aurelius, Vulpes . . . none of them can rise to lead the Legion. It was I who crushed the Executives; It was I who burned the dogs of Denver. It will be I who crosses the Dam and watches the Old World die."
  CES_irn_friends:0 "The Iron Price"

  ces_testudo:0 "The Tortoise . . ."
  ces_testudo_desc:0 "The Testudo is a new theory of Lanius, where Legion troops stand close together and provide covering fire. These tactics act almost like a shell around Legionaries, giving rise to the term 'tortoise tactics'."

  ces_lanius_texas:0 "The Wiser Decision"
  ces_lanius_texas_desc:0 "Long ago, when taking Denver, I had to face such a challenge. Many died, over many years to claim the city as ours. It was the lines of food and water that nearly broke the Legion's strength... and the lack of tribals near that cursed city.  What I felt in that struggle, I felt as I saw the map of the West. The West is a trap. The bear has already been caught in it, and it is dying. Our future lies to the east. \n\nThe Republic shall keep their Old World gate this day, I shall return East. When I return, I shall have all the armies of the Legion with me."
