 nashoba_desc:0 "Nashoba Solomon has been a lot of things in his time:\nWarrior. Wanderer. Initiate. Prisoner. Survivor.\nThese lives are behind him now.\nHe found a place to call home a long time ago and nowadays he is different things:\nHusband. Father. Grandfather. Teacher. Leader."
 cho_storytellers_and_storykeepers:0 "Storytellers and Storykeepers"
 cho_storytellers_and_storykeepers_desc:0 "It has been a tradition long before the war to pass down stories from one person to another to remember our history and our legends. These stories hold valuable lessons that made us the people we are today. Even if others are willing to repeat mistakes from their past, we are not."
 cho_building_the_library:0 "Building the Library"
 cho_building_the_library_desc:0 "We need a secure place to store every piece of knowledge we have collected already and will collect in the future. So we will build a library. A place of learning and remembering."
 cho_holotape_archives:0 "Holotape Archives"
 cho_holotape_archives_desc:0 "While some people prefer the tactile feeling of books made of actual paper, the practicality of holotapes and terminals is not to be underestimated. This wing of the library will be dedicated to the archive of every holotape that we own and the technology to read and write them."
 cho_physical_records:0 "Physical Records"
 cho_physical_records_desc:0 "Books need special care to survive a large amount of time. It is a wonder so many survived the ravages of war and the exposure to the elements in the following years. In this wing they will be stored under optimal conditions to last as long as possible."
 cho_physical_records_tt:0 "Librarian §YGreen McCoy§! becomes available for service."
 cho_scriptorium:0 "Scriptorium"
 cho_scriptorium_desc:0 "Not every piece of wisdom comes from the time before the war. There was much to be learned in the intervening years and yet more stories to be told in the future. We will record them, on paper or tape, so that future generations can learn from them."
 cho_opening_the_library:0 "Opening the Library"
 cho_opening_the_library_desc:0 "With enough material collected it's finally time to open the library to the public. We want everyone to be able to access these stories so they can learn from them and pass them on."
 cho_cherokee_wing:0 "The Applied Science and Engineering Wing"
 cho_cherokee_wing_desc:0 "We are not the only collectors of knowledge in our federation. The Cherokee Council for Science and Engineering has been doing it for about as long as we have. Even though they do focus more on the technical aspect than the historical importance. This wing is an attempt at an exchange of knowledge between our storytellers and their archivists."
 cho_defenders_of_history:0 "Defenders of History"
 cho_defenders_of_history_desc:0 "The pursuit of preserving history and knowledge is a worthy goal. Unlucky for us, this is not an easy task in the Wasteland. We need people that are willing and equipped to protect what we have acquired."

 cho_shields_of_wisdom:0 "Shields of Wisdom"
 cho_shields_of_wisdom_desc:0 "Wisdom is a shield protecting us from the darkness of ignorance. But sometimes you need actual shields to protect you from what comes out of the darkness. Also guns. Those help too."
 cho_PIT_wing:0 "The PIT External Library"
 cho_PIT_wing_desc:0 "With the opening of a shared higher place of learning the need for sources of knowledge has grown.

 cho_the_basement:0 "The Basement"
 cho_the_basement_desc:0 "While we encourage people to access the library, there are certain objects that we deem as too dangerous for the average citizen. For this purpose we have constructed a special secure storage vault in the basement of the library. Most people don't even know the library has a basement. And that is better for everyone."
 cho_nuclear_fission:0 "Pioneer Scouts Guide to Nuclear Fission"
 cho_nuclear_fission_desc:0 "The implications of this magazine are honestly rather disturbing. For some reason someone in the years before the war thought it would be a good idea to explain how to create your own nuclear bomb out of common household objects. Worse yet, it is clearly aimed at young children with easy to understand pictograms and a friendly cartoon frog guiding them through the steps."
 cho_nuclear_fission_tt:0 "§gYou will be able to use the nuke during wartime against the capital of your enemy.§!"
 CHO_nuke_decision_cat:0 "Nuclear Fission In Five Easy Steps"
 CHO_nuke_decision_cat_desc:0 "It was very easy, terrifyingly so, to create a nuclear warhead following the guide. It would be a shame to let it get to waste."

 cho_esp_and_you:0 "ESP and You!"
 cho_esp_and_you_desc:0 "Based on the quality of the print and the paper it is unlikely that this pamphlet ever saw commercial distribution. But this does not undermine the legitimacy of it's content. The volunteers that agreed to go through the program outlined in the pamphlet showed remarkable abilities, like precognition and far-sight. Those that survived, that is."

 cho_makato_achili:0 "Makato, Makato, Makato, Achili"
 cho_makato_achili_desc:0 "The stories that shaped our culture have been passed down from person to person over generations. People have added bits to them, changed parts, adapted them to current situations. And we will continue with this tradition."

 cho_living_history:0 "Living History"
 cho_living_history_desc:0 "We have an opportunity that very few people had access to. Among us walk some that have experienced more history than any single man or woman before. People call them ghouls, but what they are to us a is living history filled with stories. Stories worth being told."
 cho_ghoul_immigrants:0 "Ghoul Immigrants"

 cho_integrity_of_the_home:0 "Integrity of the Home"
 cho_integrity_of_the_home_desc:0 "We have underestimated how many ghouls would answer the call we send out. We need more accommodations and fast. At this point it might be easier to build new homes in a decent location than trying to fit them into existing places."
 cho_ghoul_town:0 "Ghoul Town"
 cho_ghoul_town_desc:0 "It took a while but we managed to establish a completely new settlement from the ground up to house all the incoming ghouls. For many ghouls it will only be a place of short rest before they find another place in our existing settlements, but we hope that for many it will be something they want to call home."
 cho_the_tattooed_man:0 "The Tattooed Man"
 cho_the_tattooed_man_desc:0 "Among the many immigrants one stood out. Every piece of his skin was tattooed with words and images. He himself has said that he has wandered for a very long time and doesn't remember his own name anymore. People tend to just call him the Tattooed Man where ever he goes. He sparks the imagination of others when he tells the stories he has experienced himself or heard on his travels."
 cho_tattooed_man_unit_leader_tt:0 ""
 cho_an_evening_of_stories:0 "An Evening of Stories"
 cho_an_evening_of_stories_desc:0 "It has become a sort of ritual for many Choctaw of all ages to gather in Ghoul Town when the Tattooed Man is going to tell some of his stories.

 cho_the_hunter_and_the_alligator:0 "The Hunter and the Alligator"
 cho_the_hunter_and_the_alligator_desc:0 "The Alligator may look weak, but it's still a dangerous beast. Bind it's feet, so it can not scratch, and it's mouth so it can not bite."

 cho_shreveport_roads_desc:0 "Shreveport used to be a trade hub a long while ago, before the devil that calls himself the wild one took over. There are still many intact roads that we can use, now that the Desperado's don't drive along them anymore. And maybe we can even encourage some traders to use these paths again."
 cho_bound_in_chains:0 "Bound in Chains"
 cho_bound_in_chains_desc:0 "Say what you will about the Gatormaws practices along the Mississippi, they had them down pat. Efficient and effective. And considering we have a lot of them imprisoned right now, we could turn them into chain gangs, building harbour facilities and ships for us.\nPoetic justice?"
 cho_mississippi_queen:0 "Mississippi Queen"
 cho_mississippi_queen_desc:0 "The Mississippi is a teacher. She moves wildly like a dancer, bacchic with wine. She demands much, but she also gives much. We would be wise to listen to what she asks."

 cho_the_nameless_choctaw_desc:0 "This evening the Tattooed Man retold the tale of the Nameless Choctaw, a son of a chief from before the Smoke and the Fire. Though something is different about how he tells the story."

 cho_the_false_knights:0 "The False Knights"
 cho_the_false_knights_desc:0 "Everyone knows the Brotherhood of Steel. They came from the west and set down in many places along the way.

And while the Brotherhood may not always be friendly, these false knights mean trouble wherever they appear."

 cho_deus_ex_machina:0 "Deus Ex Machina"
 cho_deus_ex_machina_desc:0 "While it is clear that Diana is no god or higher spirit, but just a ghost of woman trapped in a metal shell, the similarities to one of our ancient legends are too big to ignore. She herself claims no knowledge of the story but some of our people are doubtful. Was there some intervention of a higher being, trying to guide her and us, or is it just an attempt of yet another outside force trying to control our people?"
 cho_guided_by_spirits:0 "Guided by Spirits"
 cho_guided_by_spirits_desc:0 "After many lengthy debates and comparisons with the story of the unknown woman and related legends we have decided Diana speaks the truth and that she actually has no knowledge of the story itself.

 cho_kindred_spirit:0 "Kindred Spirit"
 cho_intentional_manipulation:0 "Intentional Manipulation"
 cho_intentional_manipulation_desc:0 "This situation reeks of deceit. We have learned from the past and this will not be another case of empty promises and lies for our people."

 cho_na_losa_chitto:0 "Na Losa Chitto"
 cho_na_losa_chitto_desc:0 "A creature made of shadows that's so frightening that even speaking it's name would enable it to eat your soul. Let us be like it to our enemies. Let everyone who wishes us harm fear our name."
 cho_wings_of_thunder_and_lightning:0 "Wings of Thunder and Lightning"
 cho_wings_of_thunder_and_lightning_desc:0 "Legends tell of two giant birds building their nests among the clouds, leaving sparks across the sky and being responsible for thunder and lightning.

 cho_heloha:0 "Heloha"
