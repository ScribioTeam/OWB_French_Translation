  FFI_shadow_brothers_desc:0 "It is time for us the ease the Shadow Walkers in to the federation. To do this requires a match between one of our leaders, and theirs.

  FFI_legends_of_the_monsters:0 "Legends of the Monsters"
  FFI_legends_of_the_monsters_desc:0 "Part of our plan to chip away at the pride and imagined superiority of the Two Masks is to spread rumors of our own Mil Mascaras; by circulating legends of a warrior twice the size of a man who's always ready for a fight, we can lure them into wanting a match with us."

Providing these skilled workers with actual workshops to hone their craft would be a boon for military industry."

  FFI_awakened_foundries:0 "Awakened Foundries"
  FFI_awakened_foundries_desc:0 "For far too long have the foundries of the Old World laid dormant, used for nothing more than a hideout for squatters and chem pushers. With refurbishment and refitting, once more can these great steelworks put arms in the hands of our people."

  FFI_repurposed_trawlers_desc:0 "For the purpose of naval action, pre-war fishing trawlers make for a hull that has enough bulk to be pushed around, enough deck space to put on guns, and enough engine power to outpace less consistent forms of propulsion.

  FFI_great_refuge:0 "The Great Refuge"
  FFI_great_refuge_desc:0 "The most defining moment of Mil Mascaras’s life, should you ask him of it, takes the form of his failed initial attempt to escape the slavery of the Legion, in which he sacrificed his freedom so that others may gain their own, throwing himself into a mob of Legionaries to buy his fellows time to escape.
