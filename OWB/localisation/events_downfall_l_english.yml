  ### Main Capitals
  ## New Canaan (ids 1 to 9)
  # 1: Generic
  downfall.1.t: "The Fall of New Canaan"
  downfall.1.d: "After two days of intense fighting, New Canaan has fallen to [Root.GetNameDef].  Mormon troops bravely defended the settlement until the early hours of the morning, falling back to hastily constructed defensive lines on no less than seven occasions. Whilst an order to withdraw was given late last night following a successful enemy encirclement action, the Mormon defenders of the city refused to acknowledge the order and instead took up highly defensible positions in the centre of the settlement. It was only thanks to heavy ordinance that their last stand was ultimately put down. \n\nIn the morning light, it was clear the settlement had been devastated. [Root.GetNameDefCap] spared no quarter in quashing resistance to their rule, and many building lie in smouldering ruins - including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, the Mormon's main place of worship."

  ## Shady Sands (ids 10 to 19)
  # 10: Generic
  downfall.10.t: "The Fall of Shady Sands"
  downfall.10.d: "Following three days of skirmishing, the government of the NCR has today confirmed that their beloved capital, Shady Sands, has fallen into the hands of [Root.GetNameDef]. The capture of the city comes despite fierce resistance from both the NCR Rangers and the town's militias, although precise information on the Battle for Shady Sands is very sparce. It appears that the [Root.GetName]'s final assault was spearheaded by a group of bikers who managed to overwhelm the last Ranger defenders at the main entrance. The bikers, utilising their mobility and small size, rapidly spread through the city, forcing almost every NCR Trooper to take shelter inside buildings. [Root.GetName] forces followed the bikers, surrounding and destroying each cluster of NCR troopers one by one, either by breaking down the door or by leveling the buildings NCR troopers vaily defended. \n\nShady Sands itself appears to have been heavily damaged. Only a small portion of building remain standing, including the Hall of Congress, from which flags of [Root.GetNameDef] now fly."
  downfall.10.a: "Shady Sands is lost, but the war is not."
  downfall.10.b: "The Californian front must hold!"
  downfall.10.c: "The Hall of Congress is the NCR's heart. They must sue for peace soon."
  downfall.10.e: "Even the Rangers can't stop our alliance."

  # 20: Generic
  downfall.20.t: "The Fall of Flagstaff"
  downfall.20.d: "The City of Flagstaff, long the seat of Caesar's absolute power, fell late last night to [Root.GetNameDef]. Although [CES.GetLeader] stayed to command the defence until defeat was all but certain, even his military wisdom could not save the city, surrounded as it was by [Root.GetName]'s earlier pincer movements. In his infinite wisdom, [CES.GetLeader] ordered a last stand, commanding his elite Praetorian Guard to fire on any units that attempted to desert. Ultimately the order only served to delay the capture of the city at large by a day, although even now sporadic fighting continues between invading forces and Praetorian Guard units holded up in building. Caesar's palace also appears to be still holding out, although this might shortly change when [Root.GetName]'s demolition teams get into position."

  # 30: Generic
  downfall.30.t: "New Vegas's Downfall"
  downfall.30.d: "For the first time in living memory, the casinos on the New Vegas Strip failed to open for business this morning, largely thanks to their annihilation in the fierce fighting against [Root.GetNameDef]. For four days, fighting on the Strip raged, as Securitrons and mobs loyal to the great families of the casinos attempted desperately to prevent their precious city from falling to hostile powers. Ultimately the Strip was lost, but even then the families of the Strip contined to stubbornly defend their casinos. Following a direct order from [Root.GetLeader], the casinos were demolished with the last mobsters inside them—much to the dismay of the soldier keen on looting the riches. The Securitrons, meanwhile, withdrew in the direction of the Mojave's weather monitering system, allthough attempts to find them have so far been unsuccesful."
  downfall.30.a: "Find me those Securitrons!"

  ## Lost Hills Bunker (ids 40 to 49)
  # 40: Generic
  downfall.40.t: "The Capture of the Lost Hills Bunker"
  downfall.40.d: "Some deemed it impenetrable, others deemed the conquest of it too bloody to even be attempted. However, they both initially seemed to have been proven wrong after a single day of somewhat underwhelming fighting. [Root.GetName] troops began their attack in the early hours of the morning, seemingly catching the Brotherhood napping. The first troops through the bunker doors were elites, armed with enough anti-armour firepower to crack open Liberty Prime—twice over. However, they were met with no resistance. The Brotherhood had seemingly cottoned on to the fact that power armour, their great strength, is not terribly effective in cramped hallways. They also seemingly had no appetite for a desperate last stand. Instead, unbeknownst to the attackers, they had rigged the entire bunker to explode as soon as the fourth level of the bunker was reached, and that it did. The resulting explosion could be felt across California, and resulted in the deaths of over five hundred [Root.GetName] soldiers. It seems, ultimately, those who had deemed the conquest too bloody to be justified were proved correct."
  downfall.40.a: "They pain the highest price!"
  downfall.40.b: "Even on the backfoot, the Brotherhood are cunning."
  downfall.40.c: "Expelling the Brotherhood from Lost Hills was worth the cost."
  downfall.40.e: "Thankfully it wasn't our troops."
  downfall.40.f: "With Chapters over North America, losing Lost Hills will not bring the Brotherhood down."

  # 50: Generic
  downfall.50.t: "The Destruction of Ranger Citadel"
  downfall.50.d: "The Rangers of the Arizona Wasteland, once the bane of all raiders in Arizona, have today lost their great stronghold. Although the Rangers fought well, defending their beloved Citadel for three days straight against a massive assault and against all odds, it seems the Ranger's favoured tactic of survivalist fighting could not stand up to the swarming ranks of [Root.GetNameDef]. Ultimately, the Rangers made the painful decision to withdraw from the Citadel, both to prevent further unnecessary loss of life, and to ensure their leadership is not captured in one unexpected assault."
  downfall.50.a: "We'll be back again, mark my words!"

  downfall.100.d: "In an ironic twist of fate, the capitol of the Broken Coast pirates, North Koover has fallen to raiding parties sent by the forces of [Root.GetNameDef]. Naval infantry landed on the beaches of the Upper Colombia River in the dead of night, catching the small security detachment in North Koover off guard. Official sources state that before enemy reinforcements could be signalled, these raiding parties quickly secured key infrastructure in the city, swiftly eliminated leadership figures in the enemy's chain of command, and entrenched themselves in intersections, on highrises, and in abandoned stores. Before long, the main [Root.GetNameDef] force caught up to reinforce these forward raiding parties and advanced the frontline in the war against the Broken Coast. Although the Broken Coast is still very much in the fight, we suspect that this attack has thrown their command structure into a frenzy. It remains to be seen if [Root.GetNameDef] will be able to keep up the momentum from this victory."

  downfall.110.d: "The holy crusade against [Root.GetNameDef] proved to be too much for Heaven's Gate to handle. After a grisly campaign, the carcasses of both the faithful and their creations borne of steam littered the promised land, creating a trail that led all the way to the broken gates of the cathedral and the ransacked city itself. Fighting in the city was intense as every able-bodied man, woman, and child was ordered by the Clergy to give their lives for The Archangel's vision of a pure world. [Root.GetNameDef] forces were involved in bitter urban fighting as they fought uphill to reach the cathedral at the top of the mountain the city rested upon, with each city block heavily contested by heavily entrenched infantry and civilian militia.

The guard detail in the area was quickly and quietly eliminated under the cover of night and a gaping hole was blasted into a barrier that separated The Refinery's interior from the fighting outside, providing [Root.GetNameDef] with an opening to funnel forces into the objective. Faced with defending their capitol from both inside and out and losing more men than they could sustain, El Seeyo, who had been fighting the enemy alongside his elite guard, the Mannajias, ordered The Refinery's entire garrison to surrender their arms.
