  energy_fireteam_equipment_3:0 "Gatling Laser"
  energy_fireteam_equipment_3_short:0 "Gatling Laser"
  energy_fireteam_equipment_3_desc:0 "A rotary lens design with each barrel feeding from a stacked microfusion cell allows more shots, along with improving internal cooling and precision. While the lack of a traditional ballistic feeding system makes it lightweight enough to be handled by normal soldiers, we are beginning to hit the limit of what can be reasonably hip carried, and our future research should take this fact into consideration."
  energy_fireteam_equipment_4:0 "Tesla Cannon"
  energy_fireteam_equipment_4_short:0 "Tesla Cannon"
  energy_fireteam_equipment_4_desc:0 "Originally an anti-tank weapon, this tesla cannon is modified to be more akin to an autocannon than it's heavier sibling by the installation of smaller focusing array, and quick-discharge electron packs. While not having a rate of fire comparable to other support weaponry, the sheer impact of each shot will get everyone to keep their heads down, while retaining enough piercing capabilities to puncture any conventional body armour."

  flamer_demolitions_equipment_4_short:0 "Heavy Incinerator"

  explosive_demolitions_equipment_2:0 "Fragmentation Grenade"
  explosive_demolitions_equipment_2_short:0 "Frag Grenade"
  explosive_demolitions_equipment_2_desc:0 "A mix of offensive and defensive grenades, along with demolition charges, lets our sapper be more effective in their intended demolition role. Fragmenting explosives and concussive blasts require better protection, so our engineers are equipped with reinforced helmets and steel armour plating, as well as receiving physical training to improve their throwing range."

  ground_blimp_equipment_2_desc:0 "Rearming every autocannon with armour-piercing shells, and giving a complement of shoulder-fired rocket launchers to an increased gun crew, let us destroy most ground targets quickly and efficiently in a barrage of rockets and shells."

  ground_blimp_equipment_3_short:0 "Flying Artillery Blimp"
  ground_blimp_equipment_3_desc:0 "Our rotary autocannon designs are devastating, but lack punch against hard targets. Upgrading them to 57mm automatic cannon will considerably increase our ground support capabilities, along with giving a nasty fright to any troops on the ground."

  ground_blimp_equipment_4_short:0 "Battery Carrier"
  ground_blimp_equipment_4_desc:0 "Going further into our ground attack doctrine, we increased the calibre of our automatic cannons even further, to a staggering 75mm. Transforming our blimp into the equivalent of a flying artillery battalion makes it the most devastating air asset we have against enemy troops."

  air_blimp_equipment_1_desc:0 "With supplies of explosive shells discarded, the weight saving can go toward installing quadruple machine gun turrets provided with gun-laying rangefinders, letting us gain air superiority over our enemies and protect our troops on the ground."

  air_blimp_equipment_2_short:0 "CAS Interceptor"
  air_blimp_equipment_2_desc:0 "As enemy aerial capabilities become more proeminent on the battlefield, our blimps seems like the perfect solution. Able to accompany our ground troops for as long as needed without refuelling, and with a huge stock of ammo to support them, they can tear apart any enemy aircraft trying to gain control of the sky. Adding a second autocannon in every turret in detriment of bomb load will help with this."

  air_blimp_equipment_3_desc:0 "Upgrading our rotary autocannons with smoothened firing mechanism, reinforced firing chamber, two additional barrels, and an endless stock of ammo, will let our blimp crew shoot down any aerial threat detected by the on-board radar."

  air_blimp_equipment_4_short:0 "Air Superiority Zeppelin"
  air_blimp_equipment_4_desc:0 "Protection of our troops from aerial assets is paramount. To this end, the on-board rotary autocannons have been supplemented by heavy 75mm flak guns, loaded with shrapnel shells, shoulder-fired MANPADs, and guided missile turrets, letting us destroy aircraft before they are even in firing range. Automatic targeting systems for our lighter weaponry will obliterate any fighter that managed to get through the hail of shells."

  cargo_plane_equipment_1_desc:0 "Cheap and lightweight, those wooden transport gliders are carried on the back of flatbed 8x8 trucks, and fired with the help of a dual catapult and rocket launch system, allowing for good range for such an aircraft. Otherwise unremarkable, and with low agility, they can still be useful to drop supply crates for our ground troops stuck in low-supply areas, or even fighting for their lives behind enemy lines."

  cargo_plane_equipment_2_short:0 "Cargo Plane"
  cargo_plane_equipment_2_desc:0 "A powered cargo plane with a twin engine design, this transport aircraft is much better suited to combat operations, as it includes multiple machine guns for defensive purposes and an increased top speed that lets it manage supply drops in hostile environment. A better drop system with improved parachutes let them also deliver bigger payloads, ranging from ammunition to small arms or even anti-tank weaponry."

  cargo_plane_equipment_3_desc:0 "Huge transport aircraft armed with defensive autocannons and incredible strategical range, this transport plane can carry enough supply to arm entire battalions for months. A ground-sweep radar scanning for flat terrain to allow easier drops is paired with an IFF signalling device on each supply crate to let our troops find them much faster and easier. Increased speed owing from it's quadruple turbo-prop engines also let it dodge enemy anti-air fire easier."
