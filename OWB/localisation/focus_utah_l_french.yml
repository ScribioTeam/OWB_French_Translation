War is our god, and battle our sacrament."

  utah_religion_dea_2:0 "Memories of the Legate"
  utah_religion_dea_2_desc:0 "A lifetime of war leaves its marks, both on the body and the soul. There is much to be learnt by our people from the trials of the burned man, both from his victories, and his failures."

  utah_religion_dea_3:0 "Preparing the Soul for War"
  utah_religion_dea_3_desc:0 "War is hell, but it need not be so. If the soul is prepared and the spirit willing, when the act is done righteously and without falter, it is just a chore, like any other"

  utah_religion_uin_2_desc:0 "The ancients too, knew the secret of the wind.

  utah_religion_lon:0 "Umbra"
  utah_religion_lon_desc:0 "When the world was broken down by apocalyptic fire, when the great clouds of ash had settled, and those few survivors that remained dared not leave their shelters, the world was finally at peace. No more light, no more movement, no more sound. Humanity, however, rejected this purity, and once again begain to fill the world with their disgusting clamour. Now, only we who recognise the holiness of this oblivion still pay respect to the great silence."

  utah_religion_lon_2:0 "Walking in the Shadows"
  utah_religion_lon_2_desc:0 "The hideous light, the cacophonic sound, the filth of being, all encroach upon us ever further. We must return to the sanctity of oblivion, by force if need be."

  utah_learning_from_god:0 "Learning from Elohim"
  utah_learning_from_god_desc:0 "While they consider themselves to be the first tribe amongst tribes, there is no denying that the mormons have not fallen as far from paradise as we have. With their help, we may yet regain the knowledge that our forefathers lost."

  utah_tribal_conversion:0 "Baptism"
