  KHA_focus_what_happened_in_new_vegas_desc: "Our early clashes with the NCR in the Mojave forced us to find new areas to settle.

That is, until Mr. House, with his securitrons and bootlicking tribal allies, kicked us out."

  KHA_focus_our_future: "Our Future"
  KHA_focus_our_future_desc: "The time has finally come to decide the destiny of The Great Khans, by deciding who will lead our people on to victory in the name of our forefathers. Both candidates have uniquely different views, however!"

  KHA_focus_what_we_once_had_desc: "The Khans were once a great tribe, terrorising all who stood in their way. They amassed untold riches—in old world tech, gold, women and slaves—and were the undisputed masters of hit-and-run tactics. We should stive to once again reach such glories!"

  KHA_focus_natural_opioids: "Natural Opioids"
  KHA_focus_natural_opioids_desc: "Long before the Followers of the Apocalypse arrived, the Khans had taken to using natural opioids—coyote tobacco chew and other natural plants—to enhance our bravery in the battlefield, at the cost of some addictions."

  KHA_focus_new_ideas_embraced_desc: "Like most societies in the wasteland, the Great Khans understand how important slaves are for the economy—though we are now beginning to realise they're not the only way to run the economy."

  KHA_focus_pre-war_ballistic_weapons: "Pre-war Ballistic Weapons"
  KHA_focus_pre-war_ballistic_weapons_desc: "Before the great war ballistic weapons were the primary infantry weapons used by the world's armed forces. Due to their huge usage, it is easy to find parts in the wasteland and produce these for our self."

  KHA_focus_the_secrets_of_vault_22: "The Secrets of Vault 22"
  KHA_focus_the_secrets_of_vault_22_desc: "Strange rumours of the mysteries of Vault 22 circulate the wasteland. The rumors of what is inside range from man-eating plants to pre-war experiments and wonder weapons. The only catch is that no one has ever returned from the Vault—perhaps we should try out own expedition?"

  KHA_focus_a_new_direction: "A New Direction"
  KHA_focus_a_new_direction_desc: "The world advances around us, and so we must adapt with it—so that we are not blown away by the winds of change. It has become evident that the Legion see us as little more than a tool in their hands. We must instead look towards the NCR for a better life."

  KHA_focus_bandage_old_wounds: "Bandage Old Wounds"
  KHA_focus_bandage_old_wounds_desc: "We can never forget the hell that the NCR rained down on us at Bitter Springs, but we must also never forget this was a mistake—indeed, the soldiers that partook in the massacre were only following orders, and the orders were based on incorrect intelligence.

  KHA_focus_ncr_embassy: "NCR Embassy"
  KHA_focus_ncr_embassy_desc: "The first step in our plan requires us to launch a diplomatic mission to the NCR embassy in New Vegas. From here we will be able to slowly build up a mutual understanding between our peoples, and hopefully together focus on the bigger enemy across the Colorado."

  KHA_focus_request_amnesty: "Request Amnesty"
  KHA_focus_request_amnesty_desc: "For years the Khans have been percecuted by NCR troopers, but we have also enacted violent revenge on NCR settlements in response. We should discuss the possibility of a mutual pardon with the NCR, in exchange for ceasing all raiding activities in the Mojave."

  KHA_focus_a_formal_alliance: "A Formal Alliance"
  KHA_focus_a_formal_alliance_desc: "Now that we have reached a mutual understanding, we can initiate the last phase of our plan—a military alliance."

  KHA_focus_ncr_funding: "NCR Funding"
  KHA_focus_ncr_funding_desc: "A benefit of being a part of the NCR's alliance network is the extensive funding they pump into our defence and production sectors. We should put this money to good use!"

  KHA_focus_ncr_support_development: "NCR Development Support"
  KHA_focus_ncr_support_development_desc: "What the NCR believes is old technology is very new to us, and with the NCR's help we can adapt our industry to become more efficent using this tech."

  KHA_focus_ncr_sharecroppers_desc: "Sharecropping is the system of offering protection to settlements in exhange for a share of their crop yield. We should employ this system in our territory, allowing us a sizeable reserve of food."

  KHA_focus_adopt_new_tactics_ncr: "Adopt NCR Tactics"
  KHA_focus_adopt_new_tactics_ncr_desc: "The NCR has shown us how powerful an organised fighting force can be—if we are to be fighting along side these men we should take after them."

  KHA_focus_the_red_menace: "The 'Red Menace'"
  KHA_focus_the_red_menace_desc: "The greatest threat to the survival of the Khans is the Legion. We must ensure they remain firmly on the other side of the Colorado."

  KHA_focus_for_the_republic: "For the Republic! For the Khans!"
  KHA_focus_for_the_republic_desc: "The fate of the NCR and our own society are now firmly Intertwined. We must fight to the last!"

  KHA_focus_a_neutral_party: "A Neutral Party"

  KHA_focus_restore_trade: "Restore Trade with the NCR"
  KHA_focus_restore_trade_desc: "Trading with the NCR will allow us access to countless new consumers—to the great benefit of our economy!"

  KHA_focus_new_traditions: "New Traditions"
  KHA_focus_new_traditions_desc: "The Khans have risen from the ashes many times, but does that not mean we have also failed many times? Only a fool would deny that change is needed—we must adopt new tactics in order to survive in this dystopian world."

  KHA_focus_regis: "Regis"
  KHA_focus_regis_desc: "Regis has been Papa Khan's right hand man—an excellent fixer, soldier and advisor. However, Regis and Papa don't always see eye to eye on the future of the Khans—especially when it come to how we should align ourselves in the future. Thanks to the decisions of the Council, however, Regis' time to shine has come!"

  KHA_focus_great_hunts: "Great Hunts"
  KHA_focus_great_hunts_desc: "In the past we’ve taken to hunting when times were quiet. The hides and meat of the Geckos and Bighorners can serve our people well—and the hunt itself is such a thrill!"

  KHA_focus_camp_armouries: "Camp Armouries"
  KHA_focus_camp_armouries_desc: "Our warriors should not be purely dependent on the labour of slaves to create and maintain their weapons, vehicles and armour. Each warrior should be capable of building and maintaining their own, and each camp should maintain the facilities to do so."

  KHA_focus_arms_workshops: "Arms Workshops"
  KHA_focus_arms_workshops_desc: "Camp armouries alone won't be able to cut it for the scale of weaponry production we need—instead, we should set up workshops soley devoted to the production of weapons."

  KHA_focus_slave_workshops: "Slave Workshops"
  KHA_focus_slave_workshops_desc: "Slaves in arms workshops has long been a part of the production line, but we should now ensure they are tightly woven into the production system. This will ensure only increasing productivity!"

  KHA_focus_warrior_scholars: "Warrior Scholars"
  KHA_focus_warrior_scholars_desc: "When we are not fighting, hunting, building or maintaining our gear, we should not sit back and rest our laurels. Instead we should study, ponder and learn. Anything we can learn from the wasteland is useful—it may just save lives one day."

  KHA_focus_overwhelming_firepower: "Overwhelming Firepower"
  KHA_focus_overwhelming_firepower_desc: "We don't have the men to match either the NCR or the Legion, but we can sure as hell match them in the size of our heavy guns."

  KHA_focus_warrior_training: "Warrior Training"
  KHA_focus_warrior_training_desc: "Our new guns are only as good as the soldiers that can fire them—we should therefore ensure every Khan is trained to be able to fire any weapon they find in their hands!"

  KHA_focus_reuse_old_factories: "Reuse Old Factories"
  KHA_focus_reuse_old_factories_desc: "The wasteland is filled with old, desolate factories—many still containing semi-useable equipment—that we can, and should, quickly make use."

  KHA_focus_lessons_of_history: "Lessons from our History"
  KHA_focus_lessons_of_history_desc: "Throughout our existance, we have won numerous victories—and recovered from many defeats. All of these battles should influence how we wage war—and manage ourselves in peace—going forwards."

  KHA_focus_synthesise_our_own_chems_desc: "The Followers of the Apocalypse, when they came, gave us gifts of technology and taught us how to make many weapons.

  KHA_focus_founders_of_the_chem_trade: "Founders of the Chem Trade"
  KHA_focus_founders_of_the_chem_trade_desc: "Few crops grow in Redrock Canyon—fortunately the foundation plants of many chemicals are amongst some of the few that do. As a result, many Mojave gangs rely on us for their supply of chems—earning us the title of the 'founders' of the chem trade."

  KHA_focus_old_friends: "Old Friends"
  KHA_focus_old_friends_desc: "Some of the old raider groups which we left the vault with depend on us for new and exciting drugs. We should take advantage of this for as long as we can—it will only see us prosper, and may even make them easy pickings in the future."

  KHA_focus_crimson_caravan_trade_deals: "Crimson Caravan Trade Deals"
  KHA_focus_crimson_caravan_trade_deals_desc: "The NCR officially has a ban on addictive drugs, but both the Crimson Caravan and many of the wealthy, independent merchants that make up the NCR frequently turn a blind eye in order to make a profit. This allows us to spread our influence throughout the corrupt elite of the NCR!"

  KHA_focus_the_logical_path: "The Logical Option"
  KHA_focus_the_logical_path_desc: "Few in the wasteland are worthy of even the consideration of an alliance with the Khans, but across the Colorado a very similar beast awaits. The Legion maintains many of the same views we do—including an undying hatred of the NCR—and so we should cozy up with them. Who knows? We may even crush the NCR together."

  KHA_focus_a_friend_of_the_legion: "A Friend of the Legion"
  KHA_focus_a_friend_of_the_legion_desc: "The Legion may be closely aligned with us on many issues of policy, but we do not currently have many diplomatic ties—indeed, some of the Legion's leadership sees us as little more than tribal savages! (Honestly! Us, savages! Our soldiers wash twice a fortnight—that's twice as much as they do!) We should seek to enlighten them about our heritage and culture, so that our two civilizations may intertwine."

  KHA_focus_caesars_advisor: "Caesar's Advisor"
  KHA_focus_caesars_advisor_desc: "As a symbol of our growing friendship, Caeser sent to us one of his most trusted advisors—a frumentarii who goes by the name of Karl.

  KHA_focus_join_the_legion: "Join the Legion"
  KHA_focus_join_the_legion_desc: "A grand military alliance between us and the Bull across the Colorado is the logical progression to our current relationship with the Legion. All we need to do is ask for it."

  KHA_focus_ideas_of_the_legion: "Ideas of the Legion"
  KHA_focus_ideas_of_the_legion_desc: "More than one thing has spread when we began adopting some of the Legion's tactics and organisation—namely, their rejection of all things automated. It's a view we'll have to accept if we want further benefit from the alliance."

  KHA_focus_legion_slave_trade: "Legion Slave Trade"
  KHA_focus_legion_slave_trade_desc: "Both the economy of the Legion and our own economy rely heavily on the trading of slaves. We should, as a result, attempt to combine our slave pools—giving us more access to the kinds of slaves we need the most."

  KHA_focus_a_bastion_across_the_colorado: "A Bastion Across the Colorado"
  KHA_focus_a_bastion_across_the_colorado_desc: "Whilst we're technically in a military alliance with the Legion, it's more or less taken for granted they will be unable to assist us directly should the NCR invade. Consequentially, we must build up our own defences to fend off said threat."

  KHA_focus_war_with_ncr_desc: "It will not be long now before we have our pound of flesh, but we are in need of some more fighting men to fill our ranks! Let us call the warbands back home."

  KHA_focus_legion_industry: "Legion Industrial Ideas"
  KHA_focus_legion_industry_desc: "Advisors from the Legion have explained to us several techniques to improve our industrial capacity through better use of slave labour and more efficient metal working. These shall undoubtably help us increase our output to newfound heights!"

  KHA_focus_legion_weapons_desc: "Caesar himself has ordered that we be supplied with several tonnes of weapons, ammunition, explosives, and other equipment, so that we may be able to better hold our own against the NCR. We should graciously accept."

  KHA_focus_fake_neutrality: "A Facade of Neutrality"
  KHA_focus_fake_neutrality_desc: "Whilst the protection the Legion offers is appealing, they demand too much from us in return. Instead, we should do things our own way—though it is obvious which side we favour in the clash between the Bear and the Bull."

  KHA_focus_our_own_slave_trade: "Our Own Slave Trade"
  KHA_focus_our_own_slave_trade_desc: "Slaves run many economies in the wasteland—ours included. We should prioritise enslaving as many people as we can to increase our industrial capacity."

  KHA_focus_backhand_support: "Cloak and Dagger"
  KHA_focus_backhand_support_desc: "Directly engaging the NCR troops on our borders would only lead to waves of troopers sent against us. Instead, we should send some of our elite troops to the Legion to assist them in their fight—allowing us some oh so sweet revenge whilst not jepordising the lives of our women and children yet again."

  KHA_focus_khan_addicts: "Synthetic Opioids"
  KHA_focus_khan_addicts_desc: "With new technology our own people have shifted from use of the old natural opioids to much, much stronger synthetic opioids—jet and psycho. Only an idiot would step in the way of one of these drug addicted brutes."

  KHA_focus_khan_overdose: "Doped Up Khans"
  KHA_focus_khan_overdose_desc: "By giving out a larger amount of chems before battle, we will be able to 'dope up' our men—putting them in a fit of rage and giving them a significant attack bonus at the cost of organisation."

  KHA_focus_upgrade_the_arsenal: "Upgrade the Arsenal"
  KHA_focus_upgrade_the_arsenal_desc: "No matter how courageous our forces are in battle, they can't defeat an NCR trooper with a laser musket when only equipped with a knife. We should upgrade our weaponry so that our prowess can shine."

  KHA_focus_a_khan_holds_their_own: "A Khan Can Hold His Own"
  KHA_focus_a_khan_holds_their_own_desc: "In order to even join the Khans, a warrior must prove he can hold his own in one-on-one battle. Many of our enemies don't recieve the same training."

  KHA_focus_cheap_firearms: "Cheap Firearms"
  KHA_focus_cheap_firearms_desc: "The wasteland is a treasure trove of abandoned weapons and other equipment. We must exploit this!"

  KHA_focus_impale_the_enemy: "Impale Our Enemies"
  KHA_focus_impale_the_enemy_desc: "A true Khan warrior is one that does not cower when directly in the face of his enemy, event when outgunned and outnumberd. They instead pull together and destroy anyone who opposes them against all odds—well, and the thermic lance they wield sure helps."

  KHA_focus_deal_with_gun_runners: "A Deal with the Gun Runners"
  KHA_focus_deal_with_gun_runners_desc: "A loosely-knit band of Boneyard dwellers, the Gun Runners have had a long past in the business that bears its name. They take pride in constructing only the finest, and highest-quality weapons. Although located primarily in the Boneyard the Gun Runners operate several small factories on the outskirts of New Vegas, and like every other dirty merchant they would be willing to supply us with arms for caps."

  KHA_focus_the_khan_arena: "The Khan Arena"
  KHA_focus_the_khan_arena_desc: "A large arena resides in the canyon where multiple Khans hone their melee fighting abilities.

  KHA_focus_weapon_manafacturing_quantity: "Mass Production"
  KHA_focus_weapon_manafacturing_quantity_desc: "Whilst every Khan can fight well unarmed, this is not always feasible—especially when facing down NCR troopers armed to the teeth with guns. We should focus on making weapons!"

  KHA_focus_new_tactics: "New Tactics"
  KHA_focus_new_tactics_desc: "Whilst our clashes with the NCR have meant we know a thing or two about how they fight, it also means they know a thing or two about how we fight. We need to stay unpredictable!"

  KHA_focus_iron_steeds: "Iron Steeds"
  KHA_focus_iron_steeds_desc: "Ghengis Khan led his warriors across the vast steppes on the backs of grand warhorses. We will lead ours on the backs of something much faster, and much sexier—the motorbike."

  KHA_focus_improved_housing: "Improved Housing"

  KHA_focus_one_community: "Tribal Spirit"
  KHA_focus_one_community_desc: "The Great Khans are one big family—everyone cares for each other, and someone is always there to catch you if you fall. We have our fights, but we always work out our differences. This is perhaps our greatest asset."

  KHA_focus_electronic_technology: "Electronic Technology"

Oscar managed to survive due to his unique sniper abilities, allowing him to cut down the NCR troopers who attempted to follow him up the narrow mountain passes. His skill will be of great use to us—as will the regiments of survivors he can call upon."

  KHA_focus_melissa_lewis: "Melissa Lewis"

  KHA_focus_grand_tribe_slaves_desc: "The tribes in the Grand Canyon that we did not wipe from the face of the earth may prove a useful source of productivity, as well as being able to find pockets of ore we could not. I'm sure no one will miss them if we throw them in the mines..."

  KHA_focus_integrate_the_grand_tribes: "Create Khan Outposts"
  KHA_focus_integrate_the_grand_tribes_desc: "Now that the Grand Canyon is purged of enemies, we should move a small group of Khans into the canyon and set up outposts. This land is now rightfully ours, and soon we will begin recruiting Khans from the area."

  KHA_focus_develop_zion: "Salvage Old Factories"
  KHA_focus_develop_zion_desc: "After our victory against the Sorrows we can focus on salvaging what is left of old pre-war factories in the region, this should grant us access to some useful tools. Perhaps the factories themselves may recieve a new life."

  KHA_focus_zion_slaves: "Enslave Zion"
  KHA_focus_zion_slaves_desc: "Zion has a large civillian population left, despite the drawn-out war. We only wished for Zion for the extensive strategic benefits, so we should put the populace to work in the factories and the mines!"

  KHA_focus_integrate_zion: "Integrate Zion"
  KHA_focus_integrate_zion_desc: "Whilst our fight with the Sorrows was bloody, many of the locals in settlements we have captured are sympathetic to our way of life—indeed, many wish to join the Khans. We should exploit this to raise even more warbands!"

  KHA_focus_expansion_high_chapel_desc: "We now share a common border with High Chapel, though they grow in strength and fervour by the day. We should take pre-emptive action—though we should also be careful that those nuts in New Canaan don't come running to their aid!"

  KHA_focus_integrate_wht: "New Khan Members"
  KHA_focus_integrate_wht_desc: "Many of the people within the White Legs were never opposed to joining the Khans, and also have significant experience at surviving in the wastes. We mustn't let this talent go to waste!"

  KHA_focus_enslave_wht: "Make Them Slaves"
  KHA_focus_enslave_wht_desc: "The White Legs have been our enemies, and as such we can never trust them to join the warbads. We should instead put them in shackles and send them to the factories and mines!"

  KHA_focus_khan_culture_3: "Able Bodies"

  KHA_focus_khan_culture_4_desc: "We'll never be able to field a large army, so we must develop our own tactics to make the best of what we have."

  KHA_focus_khan_culture_5: "Permanent Structures"

  KHA_focus_khan_culture_6: "Ideas of the Future"
