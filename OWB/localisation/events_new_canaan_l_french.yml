  nf_ncn.1.d: "When the bombs fell, the Prophet did not make it to the vault. One of God's elect was chosen as overseer, and he tried to guide the Church of Latter Day Saints through the darkness that followed. God's people remembered the tales of Nephi and Joseph Smith, of Jesus and Abraham. They turned to their ideals to guide us through.  Judge Samson compared our time to past moments in the Christian faith."

  nf_ncn.2.d: "And the children of New Canaan did evil in the sight of the Lord. So the Lord strengthened Ryan King of Farfield against New Canaan, because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord But when the children of New Canaan cried out to the Lord, the Lord raised up a deliverer for them: Ehud the son of Jason. By him the children of New Canaan sent tribute to Ryan King of Farfield.  \n\nNow Ehud made himself a dagger fastened it under his clothes on his right thigh. So he brought the tribute to Ryan king of Farfield.  And when he had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who had carried the tribute. But he himself turned back from the Nuka Cola sign that was at Farfield, and said, 'I have a secret message for you, O king.'"

  nf_ncn.3.d: "The New Canaanites did evil in the eyes of the Lord, and for seven years he gave them into the hands of the mutants. Because the power of the mutants was so oppressive, the New Canaanites prepared shelters for themselves in mountain clefts, caves and strongholds. And God sent them a Prophet, who said, 'This is what the Lord your God, says: I brought you up out of Illinois, out of the land of slavery. And I delivered you from the hand of all your oppressors; I drove them out before you and gave you their land. But you have abandoned him. \n\nAnd Gideon asked God, 'If the Lord is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our ancestors told us about when they said, ‘Did not the Lord bring us up out of Egypt?’ But now the Lord has abandoned us and given us into the hand of the White Legs. Why?'  \n\nAnd the Lord replied, 'go in strength you have and save New Canaan out of the mutants' hands. Am I not sending you?'"

  nf_ncn.4.t: "Every Man Did What Was Right In Their Own Eye"
  nf_ncn.4.d: "Under Deborah New Canaanite traders ranged to New Vegas and California, and made contact with the Midwest Brotherhood.  But she also encouraged deviance, letting sodomites live openly, letting bars and brothels flaunt themselves in exchange for a 'licensing fee,' and taxing the poor to support a mighty army. Deborah was overthrown in a populist uprising inspired by the faith. But Deborah died unrepentant and claiming she would be welcomed into the arms of the Lord.  \n\nHer final words were a quote from Brigham Young himself: 'The male portion of the human family are the lords of the earth, and they are full of wickedness, evil and destruction, and especially in their acts towards the female sex. But God will hold them accountable.'"

  nf_ncn.5.t: "The White Legs at the Gate"
  nf_ncn.5.d: "And the Prophet foretold the the Lord will snatch away their finery: the bangles and headbands and Pip boys, the earrings and bracelets and radios, the headdresses and anklets and guns, the perfume bottles and colas, the signet rings and nose rings, the fine robes and the capes and golds, the purses and mirrors, and the linen garments and tiaras and silk of the Shi.  \n\nInstead of fragrance there will be a stench; instead of a sash, a rope; instead of well-dressed hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; instead of beauty, branding. \n\nThus spoke Jeremiah Rigdon, when the White Legs reached New Canaan's borders."

  nf_ncn.6.t: "The War for Heaven"
  nf_ncn.6.d: "Even after Jeremiah's fiery warning, few truly believed the White Legs would be so bold as to launch an open attack. Even fewer can believe the brutality they are exhibiting in the settlements they capture. Those of the faith are executed horrifically, whilst children are being sold into slavery, all under our watch. Truly, the White Legs are a terrifying foe, and one we seem ill-prepared to face. \n\nAll our local sheriffs have been mobilised, and paired with battalions of faithful from neighbouring tribes, but the question remains: will this be enough?"

  nf_ncn.7.d: "Following weeks of gruelling manoeuvrers, forces loyal to the White Leg banner have reached the city of New Canaan itself. A recent Canaanite counter-attack has proven futile, and the Canaanites have been forced to withdraw from the outskirts of their holy city. The White Legs' final assault is underway against the few buildings in New Canaan that resist their grasp: the last hold-out of Canaanite troops barricaded in the Sheriff's building are expected to be crushed within a day. Already, however, New Canaan burns bright on the horizon, as buildings have been put to the torch by White Legs forces. Soon, all that will remain of the Mormon holy city will be twisted metal and scorched stone."

  nf_ncn.8.t: "The Day of Judgement: The Capture of Lincoln"
  nf_ncn.8.d: "Following several weeks of brutal fighting across the Utah wastes, forces loyal to the Canaanites have captured Lincoln, the primary settlement of the White Legs tribe. The capture came at an excruciating cost to Canaanite forces, with the White Legs stubbornly fighting from house to house in a desperate last defence of their homeland. Whilst [WHT.GetLeader] has reported to have fled the city, there is little doubt that the White Legs will be forced to scatter across the wasteland without their capital city in their hands."

  nf_ncn.9.t: "The Soft Hands of the Holy"
  nf_ncn.9.d: "Daniel's approach to all things theological has always held a comforting appeal to the tribes we preach in. Pledging to spread unity and compassion, Daniel has been named the new President of the Church, but has been cautioned against perusing some of his more drastic reforms by the influential traditional bloc of the Church. Fortunately he has more pressing concerns to focus his attention on for the time being, including deciding on a policy regarding tribal converts to the faith, as well as dealing with the dark stain of decadence on the nation. If he can deliver his bold promises, the Church will surely be more united and more powerful than ever before, but his path will not be smooth sailing."
  nf_ncn.9.a: "So be it, Lord."

  nf_ncn.10.t: "Decadence and Wealth"
  nf_ncn.10.d: "With the support of the clergy, and a good sprinkle of caps to help seal the deal, Jeremiah has retained his position as President of the Church, seeing off a challenge from the more devout Daniel. Pledging a continuation of the trading policies that have brought Canaan much wealth, as well as decisive action to improve the economy, Jeremiah has much to live up to. Even more pressing is the horrendous corruption that currently plagues the country, and whilst it might line Jeremiah's pocket nicely even he can see the damage it is causing his people. The path won't be easy, as surely there are many threats awaiting the Canaanites, but they have put faith in Jeremiah, for which he will reward them royally: even if it means exploiting Canaan's neighbours to do so."

  nf_ncn.11.d: "Joshua Graham is our light in the darkness. His bold leadership, focused around unifying the tribes that surround us and rapidly rearming to face off against the White Legs once more, has gained him a huge deal of support amongst the remaining congregation and the tribes that house us. As a result, Graham has assumed total temporary control of our forces and clergy in exile, and will use them to their fullest extent to ensure we return triumphant to our holy land, with a fire in our stomachs brighter than any before. After all, we can't expect God to do all the work..."
  nf_ncn.11.a: "The White Legs shall know their place before the Lord!"
  #######################################################
  nf_ncn.12.t: "A Leader in Exile"
  nf_ncn.12.d: "Jeremiah Rigdon has failed us. Money twisted him away from the Lord, as it did to many of the preachers and missionaries we once called our kin. Now, they got their punishment from God. Most of them lie dead in the streets of New Canaan, and the rest are scattered across the wastelands. Some have managed to find refuge amongst tribes we once preached in, as we have, but the numbers who have are a mere fraction of the congregation we once had. Jeremiah has reportedly escaped and fled to New Reno, where he has made use of his merchant contacts to create a comfortable life. That means that we need a new leader, one who can unify our fractured, confused and disheartened congregation so that we may, God willing, return to our holy lands. Two candidates present themselves, each with very different visions for our recovery. Daniel is the 'old' Mormon's favoured choice: his compassionate and measured approach promise unity and hope. The Burned Man, Joshua Graham, promises a radically different programme. A champion of the tribes, Graham is calling for militarization and unification to crush the White Legs once and for all. Who will lead us in this new age of exile?"

  nf_ncn.13.t: "A Church Lost in the Wilderness"
  nf_ncn.13.d: "The war may have been won, but at what cost? Whilst it raged, our flock at home suffered terrible hardships from White Legs and Canaanites alike. Corruption was rife, with greasing the right palms becoming almost a necessity to survive, and it remains at endemic proportions even now the war is over. The economy is close to collapse, having being strained by the fighting, and to make matters worse even our closest tribal allies are eyeing us with suspicion now that we occupy vast swathes of land that isn't ours. \n\nWe, the congregation, therefore face a choice. Do we throw our support behind Jeremiah once more, or do we choose a new leader? Jeremiah certainly saw off the White Legs aptly, and he seems keen to reform the economy, but there are doubts about how far he may go to combat corruption. Daniel, meanwhile, has pledged to reform the church and eliminate corruption, but he is less willing to follow through with necessary economic reforms. Who shall lead the flock forwards?"
  nf_ncn.13.a: "Jeremiah saw off the White Legs, so he is fit to lead."

  nf_ncn.14.t: "The Malpais Legate Speaks Out"
  nf_ncn.14.d: "Following the sack and salt of New Canaan by the White Legs, the Malpais Legate has been elusive, secluding himself in his dwellings. Some claim to have seen him weeping, presumably mourning the city he grew up in and the people he once called his brothers and sisters. Whilst Caesar expected this behaviour from him temporarily, Caesar expected him to continue soldiering on with his calls of duty. This has not been the case. Not only has the Legate been flagrantly disregarding his duties to the Legion, but he has also suffered frequent angry outbreaks at his advisors and friends. Whilst this may have been tolerable for a short period to Caesar, what was not tolerable is the brazen outburst he hurtled at Caesar himself during a war council meeting this morning. Not only did the Legate dare question Caesar's express orders, but he went on to denounce Caesar's decision to support the White Legs in their conquest of Utah. It was truly an outburst to behold!"

  nf_ncn.15.t: "The Prodigal Son Returns"
  nf_ncn.15.d: "Joshua Graham was once one of our flock. A gifted translator and devout Mormon, he was sent amongst the tribes to help them communicate with each other and outsider traders, brokering many a peace deal and trade treaty in his time amongst the tribes. During one of these many missions, Graham helped a certain Edward Sallow out of dire straights, and an ill-fated friendship was formed. Shallow persuaded Graham to stray ever further from God, and together the two laid the foundations of what would become Caesar's Legion. Shallow took the helm, but Graham was his trusted right hand man. Together, the two commit unspeakable atrocities far to our South, with Shallow persuading Graham to deviate ever further from his Mormon principles. \n\nThe friendship could never last, however. Caesar was ever fearful that Graham may one day eclipse him in power and popularity, and so kept a wary eye on him at all times. Sure enough, Graham stepped out of line one too many times, and so Caesar ordered him executed in the most horrific manor possible: covered in pitch, set alight, and thrown into the Canyon to our south. Caesar thought him surely dead, but by a miracle of God, Graham was spared from death. Badly wounded but with his faith in God burning brighter than our brightest flame, Graham staggered back to the tribes of Utah, who provided him with medicine, bandages, and space to rest. After recovering his strength, Graham embarked on a journey back to New Canaan, where we have welcomed him with open arms and without question. He is our Prodigal Son: baptised once in water, once in fire, and he will do what is right to protect the flock."

  nf_ncn.16.t: "Get with the Program, Old Man!"
  nf_ncn.16.d: "The Church is backwards and bureaucratic. It refuses to accept much-needed reform, much to the frustration of Daniel and his closest advisors. As a result, we have decided to fight back against these remnants of an ignorant age, and have today sent out a list of our demands to every congregation in New Canaan and our tribal allies. We anticipated that the demands wouldn't go down well with some of the congregations, but we were not expecting quite such an uproar. Some congregations have even taken up arms against our leadership, declaring us heretics, and have pledged to remove us from leadership by any means necessary! It seems we shall have to fight for our desperately needed reforms."
  nf_ncn.16.a: "Reform is right."
  #######################################################
  nf_ncn.160.t: "Reform in the Mormon Church"
  nf_ncn.160.d: "It's no secret that Daniel despises the backwards, bureaucratic ways the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints developed under Jeremiah Rigdon. Every attempt at even minor reform Daniel has attempted has been met with fierce opposition amongst local clergy and congregations, and as a result Daniel has been forced to back down more times than he cares to count. Until today. This morning, enraged by the refusal of the Church to accept any reform whatsoever, Daniel has sent an extensive set of demands to every church and congregation that adheres to the Mormon faith, laying out his detailed ideas for reform. The demands have been wholeheartedly rejected by about half of the Church, who have taken up arms in an attempt to depose Daniel for his heretical act of authoring what they dub Daniel's 'Ninety-five Theses'. The other sect stand loyal to Daniel's new vision, and have also taken up arms to defend the new order. Who will prevail?"

  nf_ncn.17.t: "A Schism in the Church"
  nf_ncn.17.d: "A rupture has emerged in the Church. Religious congregations and the Church organisation alike are being ripped apart into two distinct camps, divided over the issue of reforming the Church. The central church authority, headed up by Daniel and his pious advisors, have begun an ambitious programme of reform, aiming at cleanly cutting the Church away from its old, decadent ways. This has been met with fierce criticism, both across [NCN.GetName] and in our own lands, so much so that all-out civil war has broken out in [NCN.GetName] proper. We must now decided which branch of the Church we will pledge loyalty to. Regardless of our choice, we still risk civil war!"

  nf_ncn.18.t: "Utah Should See God"
  nf_ncn.18.d: "With the crises facing our nation firmly warded off, and our control over our holy lands re-established, the time has come to begin to face outwards again. One thing is clear to Daniel when it comes to the tribes of Utah he has spent so much time amongst, and that is that they too can see the light of the Lord, given time and tender care. Our first actions in this new era must be to spread word of our Lord to these tribes, with unified and coordinated force, so that they too may follow the word of God and his speaker on earth, Daniel. Whilst this is happening, we also have significant political changes that need to occur for the Church to fulfil the full potential Daniel sees in it: and these will not be easy to implement. Should we manage to successfully push these through the Church, we could bring the light of the Lord to all of Utah, possibly even unifying it under the Church. Only time will tell..."

  nf_ncn.19.d: "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has truly lost its way in the wilderness, but the leadership clearly have not lost their hard-fixed glare on the nearest source of caps. Under Jeremiah's shrewd leadership, the economy has recovered from the devastating war with the White Legs, and the worst excesses of corruption have been curbed. Jeremiah's next priorities are twisting the tribes around us to his whim, though it seems unlikely he'll be able to manage this without dropping the pretence that he is doing this for the good of the congregation and not just himself. Whilst this means ever greater profits and an ever stronger economy, is it really worth it when we have lost touch with those who depend on us for guidance? Apparently so..."
  nf_ncn.19.a: "Money buys any heart, it seems..."

  nf_ncn.20.t: "Utah Must Prosper"
  nf_ncn.20.d: "With the capitulation of the White Legs, Graham has achieved what most considered an impossible feat: returning the Mormon Church to its holy land, and ensuring the wastes of Utah are safe for all those who tread their roads once more. Truly, he has been a gift to us from the Lord, and so we pledge our support to him in his future ambitions to ensure Utah remains free from tyranny evermore. The path surely won't be easy, as there are many enemies around us who seek to divide us, but through God's holy flame we can surely expel these infidels from Utah once and for all."

  nf_ncn.22.d: "For as long as we have called the Salt Lake our home, trade has been an essential part of our economy. We gain the vast majority of of wealth from goods and service made here, in Utah, and traded across America and beyond. Without trade, we would have stood no change against the giant that was the White Legs, nor would we have had any change to restore our economy after the war.

Although a central White Leg authority no longer exists, significant amounts of the tribe are already beginning to regroup in as-of-yet unoccupied parts of their lands, as well as some of the wastelands owned by both [CLK.GetNameDef] and [TAR.GetNameDef]. These groups could potentially pose an even greater threat than a centralized tribe: these groups will be hard to track, and could possibly slip past our patrols in ways a more organised armed force could not.

Sure enough, little had changed since we fled each city: both settlements are little more than burnt-out wrecks, with the skeletons of our friends still littering the once-bustling streets. New Canaan received an even worse fate, it transpires, as the ground has been salted so that nothing can ever grow close to the city again. A question, therefore, remains: where should our new Church be based? Some argue we must return to New Canaan, once our refuge from raiders, and restore it to splendour. Others argue for New Jerusalem, since it was where our ancestors had their great Church. Some more radical elements even advocate making Provo our new capital, to symbolism our shift from the old ways of the Church. What shall it be, oh Living Prophet?"

The wasteland is also the main point of contention between the Bear and the Bull, and troops loyal to both sides continue to roam the plains, though they act little better than the raiders or Power Gangers that rob honest people blind. Clearly, the Mojave desperately needs to see the light of the Lord, and to do that we must have an easy route of access to the wastes.

These refugees originate from a pre-war Vault, Vault 24, whose twisted experiment seems to have revolved around playing with the effects of time on its occupants. Despite managing to survive the cruel experiment played on them, Vault-Tec played one last trick, indoctrinating them all with the belief that if they don't manage to fix the 'time machine' placed in the centre of the vault, they will be unable to send their best soldier back in time to protect their vault's creator from death, resulting in a time paradox completely wiping them out of existence. Whilst this is clearly nonsense, the appearance of these refugees poses significant questions to our leadership: do we accept these deluded fools? What about their leadership?

Few buildings in Ogden survived the massive nuclear warhead that hit the city, and even fewer survived the decades of harsh weather and scavenging that followed the bombs. One of these buildings, however, is the Ogden Armoury. Once a small National Guard armoury and headquarters, the rapid militarization of the United States preceding the Great War developed the armoury into a sprawling complex that coordinated most national guard activity in the Utah area. Whilst the ground levels of the armoury have mostly been cleared out by scavengers long before our arrival, the lower levels require a degree of expertise to access that most common scavengers lack.

One of these advanced parties, far to our south, became to the tyrannical Legion led by Caesar, and took one of our sons from us in the process. Now another advanced party has come to us, in Utah.

  nf_ncn.30.d: "Trade has been a lifeline for the Canaanites over the last century. In the early days of the settlement, caravans brought enough goods for the faithful to survive and thrive, allowing the construction of much-needed new buildings and the successful cultivation of surrounding land. As New Canaan grew, so did its influence over the caravans that criss-crossed Utah: Mormon translators were in high demand to strike deals between tribes and traders, and Mormon peacekeepers ensured the roads of Utah remained free from raiders. However, over the past decade our relationships with the many caravan companies that operate in our lands have deteriorated. They claim the tariffs we are placing on them are too excessive, and that we're taking far too large a cut in deals we help strike.

  nf_ncn.32.d: "Following negotiations with and promises to [WHT.GetLeader], the [WHT.GetName] have agreed to an alliance between our two nations. Together, we shall serve the lord and protect each other from external harm. They have also agreed to give us back the lands we lost to them many months ago: though they have warned us we may not like what we find..."
  nf_ncn.32.a: "Excellent news!"
  #######################################################
  nf_ncn.33.t: "[WHT.GetNameDef] Decline"
  nf_ncn.33.d: "Despite our best efforts, negotiations with [WHT.GetLeader] and the [WHT.GetName] as a whole have broken down. Too many potential issues presented themselves with any possible alliance agreement for [WHT.GetLeader] to be happy enough to agree. The main sticking point seems to be the White Legs ceding back our old lands: a point that is non-negotiable for us. Sadly, it seems war is the only option left to us."
  nf_ncn.33.a: "We shall return home, one way or another."
  #######################################################
  nf_ncn.34.t: "[NCN.GetName] Offers an Alliance"
  nf_ncn.34.d: "Far away, in the wastelands of Utah, a group of Mormon believers have established themselves in the ruins of what was Ogden and Salt Lake City. Having struggled for many years with the Caesar's influence corrupting tribes in their vicinity, ultimately leading to the sack of New Canaan at the hands of the Legion-sympathetic White Legs, the Canaanites have decided to tackle the problem at the head, waging their own war against the Legion in and around Utah. They've offered an alliance of convenience: we each promise to share intelligence and technology, whilst also promising not to sign a separate peace if either side were to capitulate. They also emphasize that this alliance would be purely until the Legion has been defeated. Surely this is a good deal?"
  nf_ncn.34.a: "We shall agree to this alliance."
  nf_ncn.34.b: "We'd rather wage war on our own."
  #######################################################
  nf_ncn.35.t: "[NCR.GetNameDef] Accepts"
  nf_ncn.35.d: "In the interest of defeating the menace that is the Legion, the NCR has agreed to a temporary alliance between themselves and us. We shall both share intelligence and technology, whilst also promising not to seek a separate peace if things go poorly. This is surely one of our greatest diplomatic triumphs, and should leave [CES.GetLeader] quaking in his boots!"
  nf_ncn.35.a: "Together we shall crush the tyranny of the Legion!"
  #######################################################
  nf_ncn.36.t: "[NCR.GetNameDef] Declines"
  nf_ncn.36.d: "Despite our best efforts, the NCR has declined our offer of a temporary alliance to crush the Legion. Whilst a diplomatic defeat, we both still remain fighting the Legion, who will struggle under our combined weight nonetheless."
  nf_ncn.36.a: "Disappointing."
  #######################################################
  nf_ncn.37.t: "The End of the Road"
  nf_ncn.37.d: "Following the end of the war with the Legion, the purpose of the Canaanite-Californian alliance has been fulfilled. The alliance was always meant to be temporary, and so we always knew our alliance would drift apart. Perhaps we shall unite again soon to face a new foe."
  nf_ncn.37.a: "Thank you for your sacrifice, brother."
  #######################################################
  nf_ncn.38.t: "Those Not Quite Mormon"
  nf_ncn.38.d: "Whilst we control a large amount of territory outside of our holy cities, much of it has yet to properly see the light. In an effort to avoid another sack of New Jerusalem at the hands of disgruntled outsiders, we have more or less opened our borders for all those seeking a peaceful life, helping our relations with the tribes around us significantly, but hurting our Mormon dominance. For the most part, we can keep rival power bases in check, but two groups are of particular concern to us: the Brigham Barons in the north, led by the young industrialist Rachel May, and the Farfield 'Warband', led by Marcus Furness, whose parents led the original sack of New Jerusalem. Whilst neither of the two are openly rebellious, we fear one or the other may soon be if we do not take action to help them and their followers feel a part of our country."
  nf_ncn.38.a: "A revolt should be avoided at all costs!"
  #######################################################
  nf_ncn.39.t: "The Rise of the Farfield Warband"
  nf_ncn.39.d: "Despite our efforts at abating this very eventuality, the Farfield Warband has risen up in arms against our leadership. Collecting together all manner of disenfranchised tribals, dissatisfied ex-raiders and even some wannabe-slavers, [FAR.GetLeader] has declared an open revolt, and even as we speak he marches on New Jerusalem with his hosts, seeking to re-create the Sack of New Jerusalem his parents masterminded many years ago. We can't allow this to happen!"
  nf_ncn.39.a: "Our ways of peace don't always work..."
  #######################################################
  nf_ncn.40.t: "The Brigham Barons Declare Independence"
  nf_ncn.40.d: "Inspired by our relaxing control over the northern settlements, the border town of Brigham has decided to declare its independence from our rule. Led by the charismatic [BRI.GetName], the self-styled Brigham 'Barons' have managed to draw on volunteers from a number of other northern settlements, and now pose a serious threat to our authority in the area. We shall have to deal with them!"
  nf_ncn.40.a: "They asked for this!"
  #######################################################
  nf_ncn.41.t: "A Kingdom of Utah?"
  nf_ncn.41.d: "Following the unification of the tribes of Utah under my rule, I have followed a path similar to that tread by Saul, the fist King to unite the twelve tribes of Israel. Under Saul's wise leadership, Israel managed to fend off many foreign threats, just as I have managed to protect Utah from those who wish to enslave it. Like Saul, I have been granted my place at the head of the tribes by the Lord, and so, like Saul, maybe I too should claim a title of my own. Saul was the first King of Israel, and so should I be the first King of Utah? Or perhaps, to hark back to the pre-War traditions that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was powerful in Utah's state affairs, I should name myself Utah's Governor: a title more closely matching my mercantile ambitions. Maybe instead I should choose not to adopt a formal title: surely this would bring me closer to the people I lead..."
  nf_ncn.41.a: "Just as Saul was King, so shall I be."
  nf_ncn.41.b: "I shall be a Governor, as my ancestors were."
  nf_ncn.41.c: "I will take no title, for we are all one under God."
  #######################################################
  nf_ncn.42.t: "Pioneer Day"
  nf_ncn.42.d: "Today is Pioneer Day, a major Mormon festival celebrated yearly by the Mormons of Utah and beyond. It was on this day in 1847 that Brigham Young and his followers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, where they would go on to found Salt Lake City, or as we now call it: New Jerusalem. Whilst New Jerusalem is a mere shadow of the grandeur Salt Lake City possessed, every year we can see yet more progress towards the rejuvenation of the city. So, in honour of our progress towards a new tomorrow, one closer to God, tonight we shall feast, dance and sing our songs!"
  nf_ncn.42.a: "Blessed be our ancestors."
  #######################################################
  nf_ncn.43.t: "The Kingdom of God on Earth"
  nf_ncn.43.d: "Once but a dream of [NCN.GetLeader], today God's Kingdom on Earth has come to pass. The Mormons have declared their domain 'Deseret', as their ancestors did when they established themselves on the banks of the Salt Lake, a safe and prosperous state that follows much the same borders as Utah did before the Great War. It's not been an easy struggle for the Mormons to get this far: having lost New Canaan to the White Legs, it took much sacrifice for the Canaanites to re-establish themselves amongst the tribes they once preached to, and even more sacrifice to return to their home lands. Truly, the Canaanites are blessed by good fortune if not a God, and any nation setting their eyes on Utahan lands faces a daunting enemy indeed."
  nf_ncn.43.a: "Utah is unified under God."
  nf_ncn.43.b: "They're mad. Simply mad."
  #######################################################
  nf_ncn.50.t: "The Tax Bill Comes Due"
  nf_ncn.50.d: "Jeremiah has demanded we alter our leadership to pay our debts to New Canaan. Given their stranglehold over our economy, most of our leaders wish to comply. But some think we should fight back! A civil war is breaking out between those who will work with New Canaan and those who prefer our old ways."
  nf_ncn.50.a: "This is pretty awful."
  #######################################################
  nf_ncn.51.t: "The Burned Man Comes for Us"
  nf_ncn.51.d: "The fall of New Canaan was not the end of the Canaanites. They now follow a ghost, the Burned Man.  A monster who was tossed into the Grand Canyon by Caesar, the Burned Man now stalks the wasteland for revenge. He demands we join his war against the White Legs, or face his wrath. What shall we do?"
  nf_ncn.51.a: "I don't want to die! Accept his terms."
  nf_ncn.51.b: "No ghost can harm us."
  #######################################################
  nf_ncn.52.t: "[NCN.GetLeader] Begs for Aid"
  nf_ncn.52.d: "After the fall of their capital, the leader of the Canaanites has asked us for assistance. They ask to settle refugees in [446.GetName], who will ship the resources to their place of refuge. The Canaanites have given much to us, but is this a step too far?"
  nf_ncn.52.a: "You friend of Sorrows, yes? Together we smash White Legs that defile holy places, yes?"
  nf_ncn.52.b: "We mourn for you, but we fear the White Legs"
 #######################################################
  nf_ncn.53.t: "[SOR.GetLeader] Grants Our Request"
  nf_ncn.53.d: "The Sorrows have extended the hand of friendship and sympathy for our loss.  They granted our request to settle refugees in [446.GetName]."
  nf_ncn.53.a: "Thank you, friend."
  nf_ncn.53.a_tt: "\nFor I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me.\n"
  #######################################################
  nf_ncn.54.t: "[SOR.GetLeader] Denies Our Request"
  nf_ncn.54.d: "The Sorrows sympathize with our loss, but they have declined our request.  It seems that [WHT.GetLeader] has hardened too many hearts in Utah.  It appears the lands of the Sorrows are closed to us."
  nf_ncn.54.a: "We wept, when we remembered Zion."
