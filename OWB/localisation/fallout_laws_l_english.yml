  settlement_levies:0 "Settlement Levies"
  settlement_levies_desc:0 "As far back as the rebuilding of civilization, a system of decentralized and localized levying of troops contained to individual settlements have served us well in every conflict until now. While not effective on a strategical scale, the recruitment of officers and building of regional training bases let us leave soldiers relatively close to home, boosting moral as well as civilian manpower."
  volunteer_militia_conscription:0 "Wasteland Militias"
  volunteer_militia_conscription_desc:0 "With the constantly emerging threat of the wasteland and neighbouring nations, it would do us well to reform our army into something more strategically sound. Organizing levies into regional militias let us improve our command effectiveness without pulling them from their homes, and increased funding allocated to training and recruitment increases our forces."
  funded_militia_conscription:0 "Funded Militias"
  funded_militia_conscription_desc:0 "Investing even more into our organization is a sound decision, considering the state of the wasteland. Pulling funds toward the construction of military bases let us concentrate our forces even more, as well as providing a reinforced structure within which our soldiers can train more freely with their new "toys" that our taxpayers gracefully helped acquire."
  two_year_conscription:0 "Two Year Conscription"
  two_year_conscription_desc:0 "Forcing a conscription onto our population might make a lot of people very unhappy, but it is sadly a decision we will have to take to prepare properly. To minimize the effects of conscription, a two year rotation will be put into law, which should provide our conscripts with some breathing room and a light at the end of the tunnel."
  four_year_conscription:0 "Four Year Conscription"
  four_year_conscription_desc:0 "Extending the conscription to a four year rotation will considerably increase our available manpower, but with it comes consequences. Massive funding has to be allocated to train conscripts to a decent standard for our army, and moral is slowly degrading even if our citizens understand our situation. We must be careful if we are to go further."
  until_dismissal_conscription:0 "Service Until Dismissal"
  until_dismissal_conscription_desc:0 "As of now, our government has officially declared a state of emergency. Every conscription centre is to pull overtime, and conscripts will only be dismissed when we deem them no longer useful, or the emergency passes. With moral now plummeting as civilians are even pulled from the factories and their homes, we must remember we are doing this to preserve our way of life."
  child_conscription:0 "War Never Changes"
  child_conscription_desc:0 "Civilians ripped from their homes, fathers, mothers; sons, daughters. But what choice do we have against the apocalypse? Are we to leave ourselves perish, are we not to rage against our fate until the bitter end? Already, the forced conscriptions and training leave kind-hearted people into empty shells. Our nation might never forgive us. Our citizens will hate us, our officers will resent us, and our culture might never recover fully. But it is all worth it if only to leave a hateful nation standing. Damned be the wasteland for leaving us no choice, and damned be our souls for going down this path. War truly never changes."
  # conscription laws Caesar's Legion
  tribal_recruitment:0 "Tribal Hastati"
  tribal_recruitment_desc:0 "Recruiting exclusively from our subjugated tribes offer many benefits to The Legion. Tribals are notorious for their warrior spirit and courageous soldiers, which will increase our effectiveness in battle. Recruiting only from tribals will also mean that our army is commanded by their own, as warchiefs and other high-ranks will command the rank and file."
  incorporate_mercenaries:0 "Hired Cohorts"
  incorporate_mercenaries_desc:0 "In addition our tribal forces, we can pay for and integrate a large amount of mercenaries in high-ranking officer positions and rank and files with only minimal impact on our army structure, improving our manpower pool without diminishing the warrior spirit of our forces to an extensive degree."
  settler_volunteers:0 "Recruited Auxiliary"
  settler_volunteers_desc:0 "Engaging in a widespread recruitment campaign targeting the settlers in our land will bring in considerable amount of wide-eyed recruit, willing to either die for or get paid by us. Such a huge number of non-tribal recruits in addition to mercenary forces is sure to diminish the organization of our army, as well as breeding discontent in the still mostly tribal rank and file."
  conscript_settlers:0 "Conscripted Principes"
  conscript_settlers_desc:0 "As the Bull rises, we require more and more men to fuel our conquests. Conscripting settlers to our cause in addition to our other efforts will provide us with just the right amount of soldiers to continue our conquests, but it is sure to deeply shake the structure of our army. Conscripts make for poor soldiers, and they require more training than volunteer. A conscription order is also sure to turn some of the people against us."
  conscript_children_of_caesar:0 "Nova Triarii"
  conscript_children_of_caesar_desc:0 "The obliteration of culture is one of the Legion's strongest tools at its behest. Settlers, traders, mercenaries and raiders - they all are moulded into the model of the Legion just as the Romans did to Gaul. We will remake the wasteland into our very image - and with it? We will have a army of loyal soldiers willing to die for our cause."
  # conscription laws Mexican Nations
  tlaloc_stagnation:0 "Tlaloc's Stagnation"
  tlaloc_stagnation_desc:0 "With the mighty Tlaloc having protected most of Mexico for decades, few of the Mexican nations possess a standing military, or even a federal militia. As such, resources can easily be diverted to internal matters, and a peaceful atmosphere has set in as the people feels safe under His guidance. This cannot last eternally, however."
  frontier_militias:0 "Frontier Militias"
  frontier_militias_desc:0 "Organizing willing citizen militias into nationalized armed forces will considerably increase our military capabilities, while still maintaining the peace, and diverting minimal resources to their training and armament. While it is a temporary solution, it can still buy us the time we need to properly arm our forces."
  adelitas_militias:0 "Adelitas Militias"
  adelitas_militias_desc:0 "As the need for more soldier becomes apparent, we can put in place a simple yet effective solution. Allowing willing women volunteer into our armies is sure to swell our rank, and provide us with countless capable soldiers. Putting this measure in place, however, might unnerve some of our population, as they see increasing militarization, and might break the feeling of peace that has permeated Mexico for so long."
  standing_garrisons:0 "National Garrisons"
  standing_garrisons_desc:0 "Reforming our army into a true mobile force, capable of efficient strategical movement, is an arduous task. Once done however, the militarization of our society will finally be finished, which will both increase our internal support in case of war, as well as bring a lot more recruits to our cause. Sadly, the population is now keenly aware of the fact that the flames of war are raging inside of Mexico, and will be more and more nervous as time goes on."
  mexican_conscription:0 "Gloria Mexicana"
  mexican_conscription_desc:0 "Putting in place a huge conscription program into every sector, from the fields to the factories, will bring countless soldiers to our cause, and will let any of our enemy experience the full wrath of the people of Mexico. But, in exchange, such a move is deeply unpopular, and will also take away vital manpower from some of our factories."
  # conscription laws Brotherhood
  paladins:0 "Paladins"
  paladins_desc:0 "The wasteland is an extremely harsh place. Not only will our external forces have to face raiders and mutants but also pockets of radiation, little to no food or water, and constant risk of debris in urban zones. As such, we will decide to only deploy the best of the best in this harsh place. Only the famous paladins, the highest rank our soldiers can achieve will be deployed. They shall be the brotherhood's sword, as well as its shield."
  senior_knights:0 "Senior Knights"
  senior_knights_desc:0 "As the need to project our power throughout the wasteland makes itself know, we have to compromise more and more. One cannot efficiently control vast pockets with soldiers requiring years of experience before they are deployed. Allowing senior knights, distinguished soldiers barely a rank below paladins, to deploy with them as support will bolster our troops, and still only allow the best into the wasteland."
  knights:0 "Knights"
  knights_desc:0 "With senior knights still taking a vast amount of training to deploy, and them being few in numbers in our already small manpower pool, we should consider allowing proven knights to deploy alongside higher ranks. Knights are still battle-proven soldiers, having earned not only their rank but the best weapon we can give them. Deploying them will come to the detriment of the effectiveness of our forces, but doing so will let us have many more units ready to defend the Brotherhood."
  scribes:0 "Scribes"
  scribes_desc:0 "The need for troops is overwhelming. We cannot sustain our military occupation and campaigns with only proven soldiers coming from our bunkers. Scribes are competent technicians eager to help our cause, and we can deploy them as rank and file soldiers, protected by knights and paladins. But this will mean they will not be safe in the bunker, studying technology. Deploying our scientist on the battlefield is also sure to make some of our citizens lose faith in our cause."
  initiates:0 "Initiates"
  initiates_desc:0 "Initiates are a numerous group of recruits that still need a lot of training before becoming knights. In case of extreme danger, we can decide to deploy them before they achieve that rank. Doing so means we can get troops necessitating little in terms of training, and would considerably increase the size of our army. But it will also mean sending untrained recruits in the wasteland, which is sure to turn away a number of citizens from our cause. Care is to be taken, as this decision is not done lightly."
  # conscription laws Raiders
  petty_gang_conscription:0 "Petty Gang Conscription"
  petty_gang_conscription_desc:0 "Many mock our current raiders as nothing more than a nuisance. But we can bully other gangs into joining us."
  raider_bands:0 "Raider Bands"
  raider_bands_desc:0 "Now that we have gathered a lot more strength, and more importantly a lot more guns, we can just begin firing willy nilly. While that might waste ammunition and make some fools lose sleep, it's almost certain to attract raider bands wanting to join on the fun. And for any that don't want to, we just need to point said weaponry at them instead."
  scum_and_villainy:0 "Scum And Villainy"
  scum_and_villainy_desc:0 "While we can't ever hope to intimidate the most ferocious warbands, we can certainly promise them a whole barrel of fun, as well as a few hundred barrels of actual explosives. With them they bring not only years of experience gained by riling raiders up, but they also more manpower than we could know what to do with."
  threat_to_all_people:0 "Threat To All People"
  threat_to_all_people_desc:0 "Why stop at our gang for recruitment? That's some petty stuff. Let's go even higher! We'll organize dozens... nah, hundreds of raiding parties into neighbouring territories. Blow everything up to kingdom come, make a huge ruckus, leave some calling cards between the burning bodies and the jet pit. That's sure to bring in new blood!"
  doom_of_wasteland:0 "Doom Of The Wasteland"
  doom_of_wasteland_desc:0 "With the huge reputation we now have, we are feared by all that knows of us. Some more efforts into a uh... "publicity campaign", we could even manage to have actual soldiers join us. The wasteland has no shortage of disgruntled grunts and officers that would love nothing more than to take it easy with the raider life, it's time to use that to our advantage."
  # conscription laws Tribals
  born_warriors:0 "Born Warriors"
  born_warriors_desc:0 "As per our tribe's tradition, we must assure only our warrior class ever set foot outside of our villages. The wasteland is a cruel place, full of horrible creatures and savages. We must take extreme precaution in deploying our people, and so only warriors trained from birth may earn the honour of waging war for the tribe."
  veteran_pathfinders:0 "Veteran Pathfinders"
  veteran_pathfinders_desc:0 "While it may be a mistake to break ancient tradition, we should consider increasing our fielded manpower. The tribe requires more of their own to defend itself, as such we shall consider deploying our most veteran pathfinders and hunters along with our warrior class, supporting them in their noble fight against the cruel wasteland."
  able_bodied_tribesmen:0 "Able Bodied Tribesmen"
  able_bodied_tribesmen_desc:0 "The outside world batters and wear down our tribe constantly, dangers besetting us from all side. We might not be able to survive without drastic measures, as such, we shall now deploy every able-bodied tribesmen. Courageous, trained, and following our tribe's most difficult warrior ritual, they are hardy fighters, ready to defend our land."
  first_sons_and_daughters:0 "First Sons And Daughters"
  first_sons_and_daughters_desc:0 "Shamed and humbled by our enemies, we must seek refuge into the inner strength of our tribe. While it is deeply unsettling to resort to such measures, we must now force a general conscription on every first son and daughter of fighting age of every tribe member. It is a harsh decision not taken lightly, and we shall make sure to use them for a higher purpose."
  children_and_mothers:0 "Children and Mothers"
  children_and_mothers_desc:0 "The bloodthirsty savages are at our door. We are facing nothing less than the total annihilation of our way of life, as well as every member of our noble tribe. May our gods forgive us for what we will do, but we have no other choice than to send everyone into the fight, be them children barely able to swing a knife or their mother trying to protect them. The least we can do is deploy them together. May They have mercy upon our sinful souls, for our consciences will have none."
  # conscription laws NCR
  ncr_disarmed_nation:0 "Peacetime Corps"
  ncr_disarmed_nation_desc:0 "The NCR maintains a token military force, preferring to use economics and other forms of soft power to exert its influence abroad."
  ncr_volunteer_militia_conscription:0 "Volunteer Military"
  ncr_volunteer_militia_conscription_desc:0 "With the constantly emerging threat of the wasteland and neighbouring nations, it would do us well to reform our army into something more strategically sound. The NCR Senate has authorized the recruitment of volunteers to form the new military force."
  ncr_funded_militia_conscription:0 "Fully Funded Military"
  ncr_funded_militia_conscription_desc:0 "Investing even more into our organization is a sound decision, considering the state of the wasteland. Pulling funds toward the construction of military bases let us concentrate our forces even more, as well as providing a reinforced structure within which our soldiers can train more freely with their new "toys" that our taxpayers gracefully helped acquire."
  ncr_two_year_conscription:0 "Two Year Conscription"

Massive funding has to be allocated to train conscripts to a decent standard for our army, and moral is slowly degrading even if our citizens understand our situation. We must be careful if we are to go further."
  ncr_until_dismissal_conscription:0 "Service Until Dismissal"
  ncr_until_dismissal_conscription_desc:0 "As of now, our government has officially declared a state of emergency. Every conscription centre is to pull overtime, and conscripts will only be dismissed when we deem them no longer useful, or the emergency passes. With moral now plummeting as civilians are even pulled from the factories and their homes, we must remember we are doing this to preserve our way of life."
  ncr_child_conscription:0 "War Never Changes"

Are we to leave ourselves perish, are we not to rage against our fate until the bitter end? Already, the forced conscriptions and training leave kind-hearted people into empty shells. Our nation might never forgive us. Our citizens will hate us, our officers will resent us, and our culture might never recover fully. But it is all worth it if only to leave a hateful nation standing. Damned be the wasteland for leaving us no choice, and damned be our souls for going down this path. War truly never changes."
# conscription laws NCN
  ncn_disarmed_nation:0 "Descendants of the Founders of New Canaan"
  ncn_disarmed_nation_desc:0 "We are Canaanites and our task is to spread enlightenment and the word of the Lord in Wasteland. Our Bible tells us to be merciful, and therefore we give shelter to others. But this shelter must be protected, and this is our duty. We are Chosen People, which means that our duty as descendants of the founders of New Canaan is heavier than that of anyone else."
  ncn_volunteer_militia_conscription:0 "Descendants of the Converted"
  ncn_volunteer_militia_conscription_desc:0 "Wasteland threats like the White Legs tell us that we need more people to take up arms to protect our home. The descendants of those who once received the word of Christ are just right for this role. It may not be right to transfer our debt to others, but we simply have no choice."
  ncn_funded_militia_conscription:0 "Converted to Faith"
  ncn_funded_militia_conscription_desc:0 "The Lord tells us to be merciful, but we simply have no choice due to threats from the outside world. From now on, if you want to become Brethren and Sisters of New Canaan, you must serve in the army. Yes, we will thus refuse to help many, but we need to do it."
  ncn_two_year_conscription:0 "Converted Tribals"
  ncn_two_year_conscription_desc:0 "Arming tribals with weapons is not right. They do not remember the sins of their ancestors, they can build a new world, and we assure them, as if killing people with a different faith is an action pleasing to Christ. This is a violation of all principles of our faith."
  ncn_four_year_conscription:0 "Missionary Recruiters"
  ncn_four_year_conscription_desc:0 "From now on, all our missionaries will convince people that New Canaan is the promised land. Only by protecting it, it’ll be possible to go to heaven, and the deceased for their protection are automatically freed from all sins. Yes, we are not only violating the foundations of our faith, but we are perverting what was written in the Bible."
  ncn_until_dismissal_conscription:0 "Erase Confession Differences"
  ncn_until_dismissal_conscription_desc:0 "We will begin to call to the service not only Mormons and Canaanites, but also all other Christians who live in the Wasteland. Descendants of those who came from Mexico and believe in Santa Muerte, Refugees from Heaven's Gate, who’s worship to Steam? Even the Protestants from Snake Valley. They will all defend our faith, whether they like it or not."
  ncn_child_conscription:0 "Convert by Force"
  ncn_child_conscription_desc:0 "Previously, people had a choice - to accept the word of Christ, to accept responsibility for their own destiny and make a conscious let to atone for their own sins, or simply stay to live in our lands. Now we do not give this choice. Everyone who lives on our lands will be forced to accept our faith and all the responsibilities associated with it, even if they do not want to. This is completely contrary to the foundations of Christianity, the idea of voluntary atonement. We force people to do this by force, not by word. And so, we will burn in Hell until the Second Coming of Christ. We can only hope that our children, for whom we commit all these sins, will cancel it all for the salvation of their own souls."

  TWO_legionem_foederati:0 "Legionem Foederati"
  TWO_legionem_foederati_desc:0 "Thanks to Caesar Legion, we are no longer mere tribals in the Wasteland. But at the same time, we still fight the way we are accustomed to ourselves, using the tactics that work best for us."
  TWO_barbarisque_auxiliis:0 "Barbarisque Auxiliis"
  TWO_barbarisque_auxiliis_desc:0 "We are now part of a new idea, a new society and a vision of the world. We should use not only the traditional tactics for us, but also the basis of the military machine - the infantry."
  TWO_equites_cohortes:0 "Equites Cohortes"
  TWO_equites_cohortes_desc:0 "We should be using not only our tactics, but also the view of Legion warfare, such as the tactics of using large formations, logistics, siege weapons and much more. And the history of Rome can give us all of this."
  TWO_sociis:0 "Sociis"
  TWO_sociis_desc:0 "We've borrowed enough from the Legion to be considered, if not full-fledged citizens of this new nation, then not very different from them. Of course, this means consigning to oblivion our traditions, our gods and ancestors. But that is the price for a place in the New World."
  TWO_alae:0 "Alae"
  TWO_alae_desc:0 "Specialized cavalry units in ancient Rome were called alae. What if not the machines we use are worthy to take their place? We have achieved the perfect synthesis between the Legion war machine and our traditions, with only strengths and no weaknesses. Of course, this also means that our warriors are already more legionnaires of the Two Suns, praising Vulcan, not Naas. If our gods really had power, they would destroy us for such treachery."
# conscription laws NAV
  NAV_legionem_foederati:0 "Legionem Foederati"
  NAV_legionem_foederati_desc:0 "Thanks to Caesar Legion, we are no longer mere savages in the Wasteland. But at the same time, we still fight the way we are accustomed to ourselves, using the tactics that work best for us."

  NAV_vexillatio:0 "Vexillatio"
  NAV_vexillatio_desc:0 "Vexillatio are special mobile units in the Roman army with a flexible structure, created and disbanded as needed. For the legions of Rome, this gives flexibility in a matter of operational action. We will get in this way the ideal tactics for the maneuver war we are used to. Of course, some will say that our abandonment of the ways of our ancestors will incur the wrath of Naagloshii, but this is the only way to preserve at least a part of our culture in this New World."
# conscription laws ghouls
  ghoul_military_in_both_lives:0 "Military in Both Lives"
  ghoul_military_in_both_lives_desc:0 "We trust our protection only to those in whose skills we are absolutely confident. These are members of the National Guard, military and rangers who still remember the times of the United States. There are few of them, but they are the best of the best, and therefore we can be sure that the losses among them will be minimal."
  ghoul_volunteers:0 "Service for Volunteers"
  ghoul_volunteers_desc:0 "Due to losses, we are forced to open the way to military service for volunteers. Yes, they are far less trained than those who trained by Old World standards. But at the same time, they are still better than the average human, as many have survived in the Wasteland for almost two centuries."
  ghoul_conscription:0 "Conscription"
  ghoul_conscription_desc:0 "In connection with current events, we are forced to resort to the conscription of those ghouls, fully retaining their rationality. Of course, few will like it. But this is a compulsory measure to preserve our people."
  ghoul_feral_ones:0 "Almost Feral"
  ghoul_feral_ones_desc:0 "We are left with no choice but to recruit into military service those who are usually avoided even by ghouls - feral ghouls. They are almost impossible to control, so our army will turn into an uncontrollable herd, relying more on instincts than on tactics and strategy. Our almost instinctive brethren will soon be used as cannon fodder, which will be sent to enemy machine guns from a simple calculation. We have more feral ghouls than the enemy has ammunition."
