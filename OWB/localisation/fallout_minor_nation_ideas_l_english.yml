This was fortunate indeed, because less than half a century after the Great War the Hondurans would find themselves under attack from Central America. It appears other Central and Southern American nations were not so fortunate in their preparations, and had fallen into raider-driven anarchy.

  PMR_slaves_and_drugs_desc:0 "Port Maw's economy is driven almost completetly by the sale of slaves and drugs. While the trade may neither be moral nor terribly profitable, Port Maw's unqiue status as one of the few non-cannibal settlements in Oregan means they get a suprising amount of customers. After all, it's better to be hooked on Psyco than in a cannibal's stew."

  PMR_wannabe_criminal_empire_desc:0 "The gangs of Port Maw have their eyes set on a high prize: to be the hub of a vast criminal empire trading in slaves, smuggled goods and caps. Sadly they face a fair bit of competition, with drugs pouring out of The Den and New Reno, while slaves are readily traded along the northen coastlines. Regardless, the promise of future glory encourages swathes of desperate young people with no other life prospects to join the gangs. Poor buggers."

  bel_spirit_of_liberty_desc:0 "American propaganda was strong in the years before the Great War, leaving deep impressions on those who called America their home. Indeed, American propaganda was so strong that it still has a lasting effect on the ghouls of Bellingham some 200 years later. The emphasis on liberty, and American world dominance, have become key to Bellingham's fiercely independent culture."

Combining the experitse of the two gangs, and their skilled leaders, the \"Baja Banditos\" run an enourmous smuggling operation.

  oly_park_legacy_desc:0 "While the days of park rangers and guided tours are long gone, the cultural importance of orienteering and understanding nature remained empressed on the Olympus Tribe over the centuries since the Great War. Their knowledge of industry or construction may be basic to say the least, but nobody can out-maneuver the warriors of the Olympus Tribe."

  oly_nomadic_traditions_desc:0 "After the bombs fell, many in Western Washington fled to the Olympus National Park to escape the nuclear hellfire that engulfed major cities. However, there was nowhere near enough houses to accomodate the influx of people, and instead everyone had to become used to a more nomadic lifestyle. As knowlegde of their past withered away between successive generations of apocalypse survivors, the importance of constantly moving and adapting remained core to the tribe."

  vip_legacy_of_great_snake_desc:0 "Decades before the Vipers were forced to flee California by the Brotherhood of Steel, the Vipers worshiped their Great Snake god. Their entire lives and cultures revolved around the Great Snake, and its poision: sacrifices were made to it, its poison was ritually cosumed and weapons were made smothered in its venom. While the \"Pit\", where the Great Snake resided, was destroyed by the Brotherhood when they finally drove the Vipers from California, fragments of the Vipers' old religion remains. One of the most important lessons that has survived the hard years the Vipers have wandered in the wasteland is regaarding survival of the fittest. Sure, some half-decent cannon fodder may die before their time, but this way the Vipers are strong."
  vip_a_broken_tribe:0 "A Shattered Tribe"
  vip_a_broken_tribe_desc:0 "When a band of Vipers set upon a patrolling group of the Brotherhood of Steel in 2155, they had no idea who they were making enemies with. In the resulting fight the leader of the small Brotherhood patrol group, a certain Maxson II, was struck and fatally injured by a poisoned arrow. Unfortunately for the Vipers, Maxson II was none other than the Brotherhood's High Elder: his death stirred the Brothehood up into a genocidal fury. By 2261, after 6 years of being hounded relentlessly by the Brotherhood, the Vipers finally shattered. Bands fled across America, with some settling in the Mojave, some in Nevada and some as far afield as the Hounds of Hectare. The Vipers are a mere shadow of their former selves."

Blessed by their proximity to the Rio Grande river and the large cattle herds that grazed the area before the Great War, Pecos has survived and thrived through a heavy focus on cattle rearing. Their wealth of knowledge when it comes to post-apocalyptic animals makes them skilled hunters and influential brahmin herders: the Colony hosts almost as many Brahmin as it does people."

The few settlements in the Colony that do exist are mainly used for traiding, while the people are highly agile. If one settlement falls to raiders, the entire community can easily relocate with most of their worldly posessions."

These spirits guide the Umbran tribe, offering them advice and insights into the future. While how true these spirits' words are is somewhat debatable, the fundamental religious belief in their existance helps the Umbran tribe stay motivated like few others."

All eleven nations remain represented on the Legislative Council, and work together to ensure the saftey and prosperity of the Nation."

  #SHO

  sho_outcasts_once_again_desc:0 "For centuries after the arrival of European colonists in America, the Shoshone made their home in the rough terrain of the west. Of the many Shoshone groups, a significant number settled in Utah and southern Idaho, and achieved federal recognition in the late 1900s. Like many other Native American Nations and Tribes, the Shoshone fared resonably well in the post-apocalytic wasteland: their ancestoral teaching proved useful in an era of hunting and gathering, and the reservations the USA threw many native groups in were remarkably undamaged by nuclear hellfire. However, trouble began for the Shoshone in the decades after the nuclear ash began to settle. Utah and Idaho became stricken by religious wars: a huge variety of neo-christian groups, all with their own twisted interpretation of the bible, decided Utah should be theirs. Between the zealouts in Heavens Gate, the \"pious\" in High Chapel and the schism between Murtagah and the Lord's Annointed, the Shoshone found themselves being persecuted from all sides. Eventually the Shosone were forced to flee west, away from their ancestral land, where they remain plotting their next move."

While they may have been expelled from their homeland, the Shoshone's continued access to the Snake River means they are far from clueless about how to survive."
