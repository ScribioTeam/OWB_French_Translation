  CHR_project_uktena: "Project Uktena"
  CHR_project_uktena_desc: "A series of sub-projects below the umbrella of the Uktena Project. Some of the results of the project were of questionable nature. But it would be a shame to let all that effort go to waste."
  chr_pestilent_breath_decision: "Unleash Pestilent Breath"
  chr_pestilent_breath_decision_desc: "Releases an extremely poisonous gas among our enemies that kills in about a minute. I think stuff like this used to be outlawed by someone?"
  chr_uktenas_gaze_decision: "Use Uktena's Gaze"
  chr_uktenas_gaze_decision_desc: "The enhanced mesmetron, codename Uktena's Gaze will overload our enemies brain and send subliminal messages at the same time. Messages such as 'surrender peacefully', 'stop' or 'kill your friends'. The third setting proved to be the favourite among users during our preference survey."
  chr_ulusunti_bots_decision: "Use Ulun'suti Bots for Public Works"
  chr_ulusunti_bots_decision_desc: "Gaining some good will by improving the living standards of our citizens with our builder bots will go a long way in not having our nation implode around us the next time we release some scientific abomination."
