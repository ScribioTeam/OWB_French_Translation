  bhd.1.t:0 "The Ungodly Child of Neptune and Jupiter"
  bhd.1.d:0 "The Hoover Dam: a great, hulking slab of concrete towering above the Colorado river, which gushes through its long silent turbines and overflows. We first heard about the Dam from those of the Twisted Hairs that joined our legions, though they dismissed it as lifeless and broken. It seems in the years since they last visited it, that has changed. Recent scouts, under direct orders from Caesar, have observed a significant buildup of military forces, and the remarkable resumption of power production. Most of this power appears to being diverted West, to the entity known as the 'New California Republic', but some seems to be going to what was once Las Vegas: now an illuminated jewel in the desolate Mojave wasteland. \n\nWhile masses of power and old world technology are of little concern to a Legion as vast and mobile as we, the Hoover Dam holds something much for important to Caesar: the keys to the Mojave. Only by seizing and holding it will we be able to spill West in great numbers. If we hold the Dam, we can seize the Mojave and march for Vegas. Caesar will at last have his Rome."
  bhd.1.a:0 "Malpais will lead. There must be no delay!"
  fbhd_ces_pre_tt:0 "In §yfive days§!, the §OMalpais Legate§! will lead an attack on the §OHoover Dam§!, using troops deployed adjacent to it. The attack will be in the form of a §Oborder war§!, influenced by our previous actions regarding the Mojave and the Dam.\n\n"
  bhd.2.t:0 "A Mustering Across the Dam"
  bhd.2.d:0 "For some time, we have had knowledge of some great power in the harsh wastelands East of the Colorado River. From traders arriving from Utah and Arizona, we even gleamed the area appears to be dominated by some batshit, neo-Roman cultists who swear loyalty to their 'Caesar' and crucify those that oppose them. However, we have for a while thought little of them: they appear to have few major cities to their name, and mostly disregard modern technology in favour of more primitive melee equipment. Just another raider band, it seemed. \n\nIt appears recent events have forced us to reconsider that evaluation, however. Over the last few months, we've been spotting more and more scouts glad in similar armour appearing and disappearing. Last week, a division made camp within view of our patrols. Today, a company arrived, with more seemingly on their way. Why are they here? Well, there's only one thing worth taking in the area: the Hoover Dam.We must prepare our defences. Urgently."
  bhd.2.a:0 "Alert all our units. Prepare to defend the Dam."
  bhd.4.t:0 "The Battle for the Hoover Dam"
  bhd.4.d:0 "The Hoover Dam, stretching across the mighty Colorado, has become the battleground between two vast forces today. On orders directly from Caesar, the Malpais Legate himself is leading a massive force of Legionnaires and tribal auxiliaries in an attempt to seize the so-called 'Old World Wall' from the hands of the New California Republic, who have held it since the 2274 Treaty of New Vegas. The Legion, aided by its superior numbers and fierce obedience to orders, seems to have the upper hand in the clash, but will need to carry any momentum it gains from breaking through at the Dam to secure it from counter attack. \n\nIf they should succeed, the Mojave and the lights of Vegas will lay open for Caesar to grab. Should they fail, the Malpais Legate may find himself in a difficult spot, and the NCR will retain their hold on the Mojave for a little while longer."
  bhd.4.a:0 "The savages will be repelled. For the Republic!"
  bhd.4.b:0 "Nobody will stop Caesar's march to his New Rome."
  bhd.4.c:0 "The battle will shape the Mojave, no matter the outcome."
  bhd.5.t:0 "Victory at Hoover Dam"
  bhd.5.d:0 "While our victory at the Dam was anticipated, it has come to the relief of the Legate that victory has been achieved. NCR Troopers may have fought bravely in a well-planned defence of the Dam, but ultimately our superior numbers and the inherently indefensible nature of the Hoover Dam. While those factors combined to bring us initial victory here at the Dam, the very same factors may be our undoing: we will face a multi-fronted counter-attack while defending open and narrow terrain. Unless we can carry our momentum forwards and seize Boulder City we face swiftly losing the Dam to a Californian counter-attack. Fortunately, the Malpais Legate assures us he has a plan for the capture of Boulder City."
  bhd.5.a:0 "We must march to Boulder Dam!"
  bhd.6.t:0 "Defeat at the Dam"
  bhd.6.d:0 "The cowards of the NCR have defeated our epic heroes with their 'combined arms tactics' and 'enfileade fields of fire.' We will be back, but this is a dark day for the Legion. "
  bhd.6.a:0 "The troops believe Mars deserted us!"
  bhd.7.t:0 "Stalemate at the Dam"
  bhd.7.d:0 "The Malpais Legate has called off the assault on the Great Wall. For some reason, he thinks we will never prevail. Can Caesar truly forgive this cowardice? One wonders . . . "
  bhd.7.a:0 "When did he become so weak!"
  bhd.8.t:0 "The Old World Wall Holds"
  bhd.8.d:0 "Cheers erupted today across the Republic as news broke that the Legion had been repelled in spectacular fashion from the Hoover Dam. For days NCR troopers and rangers have bravely fought and died on the cold concrete surface of the gigantic structure, locked in an ever-changing conflict with an enemy more vicious, loyal and organised than any we have faced before. The battle was closer than any of us would have liked, in part thanks to the Legate commander that opposed us. Regardless, through our defensive forethought and more sophisticated weaponry and tactics, we have been able to win the day. We've certainly dealt a blow to the Legion, but few in the Mojave have a doubt they will be back again: in some form or other."
  bhd.8.a:0 "We must keep a weary eye east."
  bhd.9.t:0 "The Old World Wall Falls"
  bhd.9.d:0 "Despite the valiant efforts of many a trooper and ranger, we have proven unable to repel the Legion attack from seizing the Hoover Dam from our grasp. While unfortunate, the loss of the Dam is not the end of our clash. Both our generals and those opposing us recognise the Dam is all but indefensible without holding the strongpoints on both sides of it. For that reason the Legion has pressed their assault into Boulder City, and are anxious to capture it to prevent us being able to counterattack on multiple fronts. We must hold the city at all costs. Success, and we will be able to chase the Legion back across the Colorado. Failure, and we risk our Mojave forces being chased back to Nipton, or even beyond."
  bhd.9.a:0 "Resist and bite!"
  bhd.10.t:0 "Stalemate on the Old World Wall"
  bhd.10.d:0 "While not the stunning victory Oliver was hoping for, the stalemate that the battle over the Hoover Dam has turned into has resulted in something of a strategic victory for us. Sure, we lost dozens of men and their equipment, but at least the Legion was unable to make any real progress in capturing the Hoover Dam. After days of deadlock, the Legion has finally backed down, unable to sustain a protracted conflict without reinforcements. We have won a temporary reprieve from Legion attacks, but we must not get complacent. They will doubtless return."
  bhd.10.a:0 "A bloody victory is better than defeat."
  bhd.11.t:0 "Victory at Boulder City"
  bhd.11.d:0 "Boulder City, a small NCR-controlled frontier town sat just behind the Colorado river, was never meant to be a difficult place to conquer. Surrounded on two sides by open ground, and penned in on the other two by harsh ridgelines and the Colorado itself, waves of the Legate's troops should have brushed aside any resistance the NCR put up. Indeed, they did: despite fierce sniper fire from the NCR's rangers, waves of Legion troops forced the mottly NCR defending force to rout within minutes of Legion troops reaching the city. \n\nEven though their leadership had been decimated by Ranger sniper fire, the Legate's forces knew one tactic: charge. So they did. Waves of soldiers poured into Boulder City, overwhelming the Rangers' sniper nests. But the Rangers detonated the explosive charges they had laces throughout Boulder City, but to little effect: the bulk of the Legate's soldiers were charging their ridge, after all. A massacre was narrowly avoided by the Malpais disciplined training of his forces. Trumphantly he marched south, routing the NCR completely."
  bhd.11.a:0 "The Mojave is ours!"
  bhd.12.t:0 "The Miracle at Boulder City"
  bhd.12.d:0 "Boulder City, a small NCR-controlled frontier town sat just behind the Colorado river, was never meant to be a difficult place to conquer. Surrounded on two sides by open ground, and penned in on the other two by harsh ridgelines and the Colorado itself, waves of the Legate's troops should have brushed aside any resistance the NCR put up. Indeed, they did: despite fierce sniper fire from the NCR's rangers, waves of Legion troops forced the mottly NCR defending force to rout within minutes of Legion troops reaching the city. However, once the bulk of the Legion's forces reached Boulder City, they stood confused. Ranger sniper fire had decimated the Legion's leadership, leaving units leaderless and milling around Boulder City... \n\n* BOOM * \n\nJust like that, the NCR sprung its trap. Dozens of explosive charges laced across Boulder City detonated in unison, utterly annihilating the Legion troops in the city. The Legion's defeat was total, and Graham had no choice but to turn his tail and run."
  bhd.12.a:0 "We will return, it time."
  bhd.13.t:0 "Boulder City Reaches a Stalemate"
  bhd.13.d:0 "We may have been able to punch through the NCR's front lines on the Hoover Dam, fighting in and around the heavily defended NCR-occupied down of Boulder has drawn to a stalemate. Successive charges of the Legate's finest have assaulted and perished before the NCR's front, and after at last the Legion's seemingly infinite pool of manpower at the Dam has been exhausted. Lest he be completely overwhelmed by an NCR counter-attack, Malpais has made the decision to retreat back across the Colorado and lick his wounds. Caesar will surely not be please..."
  bhd.13.a:0 "With our forces so far from home, we must retreat."
  bhd.14.t:0 "The Miracle at Boulder City"
  bhd.14.d:0 "Defending Boulder City was, in our minds, a long shot at best. Despite that, we knew we had to try: defeat here would jepordise our entire Campaign, with our next defensive line not until Nipton. And by the Republic, did we try. As soon as the Legion broke our lines at the Dam, the 1st Recon Division sprung into action, raining down sniper fire on ranking members of the enemy force. Working together to execute a series of sophisticated maneuvers and bluffs, Ranger Chief Hanlon and General Oliver were able to goad the Legate's force into an all-out charge on Boulder City itself. When they reached the city, they found no troopers to be found: instead, there was only explosives. With a cacophonous boom which could be heard across the Mojave wastes, the explosives placed so hurriedly by our rangers detonated. Almost the entire assaulting army was caught in the blast and annihilated instantly. The few that survived fell back in sheer panic: and at that moment we pressed our advantage. Using what little troopers and rangers we had remaining, the surviving Legion forces were chased across the Dam, their tail between their legs. Whilst we were unable to peruse them east of the Colorado, due to the huge loss of troopers and immense exhaustion of those who survived, the Legion will certainly thing twice before attempting to seize the Dam again."
  bhd.15.t:0 "The Collapse of the Campaign"
  bhd.15.d:0 "Defending Boulder City was, in our minds, a long shot at best. Despite that, we knew we had to try: defeat here would jepordise our entire Campaign, with out next defensive line not until Nipton. And by the Republic, did we try. As soon as the Legion broke our lines at the Dam, the 1st Recon Division sprung into action, raining down sniper fire on ranking members of the enemy force, significantly limiting the enemy's capability for tactics or strategy. Despite this, we could not kill enough of the enemy with sniper fire alone to stem the tide of men pouring across the Dam. Even without their immediate commanding officers, the Legionnaires and their tribal auxiliaries were able to use their overwhelming numbers to overrun our last-ditch defence in Boulder City. No miracle could be achieved, despite the best efforts of Hanlon and his rangers, who attempted to detonate explosives inside the city once we were forced out. Alas, even they caught but a small fraction of the foe's strength in their blast. \n\nWe must not take what few troops remain and fall back to the town of Nipton. All territory north of it will, sadly, need to be surrendered: we simply lack the men and defensive lines to hold off the hoard. Who knows, maybe one day we will return to the Dam."
  bhd.15.a:0 "We embark on a long march home."
  bhd.16.t:0 "Boulder City Reaches a Stalemate"
  bhd.16.d:0 "Defending Boulder City was, in our minds, a long shot at best. Despite that, we knew we had to try: defeat here would jepordise our entire Campaign, with our next defensive line not until Nipton. And by the Republic, did we try. While we were unable to decisively repel the Legion form their attack, they also were unable to throw us out of Boulder City. They knew as well as we did that they would not sustain a protracted offensive, nor could they hold the Dam without Boulder City. As a result, they withdrew. We have no doubts they will return, in larger force and better prepared, and so we must prepare. Maybe, just maybe, we have earned ourselves a little breathing room."
  bhd.16.a:0 "A bloody victory at best."
  bhd.17.t:0 "The Legion Overrun the Mojave"
  bhd.17.d:0 "Malpais Legate parades his troops to the borders of the NCR itself, and their prisoners march east to Flagstaff. With the fall of the Mojvae Territory, New Vegas lies undefended, and the Wasteland holds its breath."
  bhd.17.a:0 "The Mojave will be ours in the future."
  bhd.17.b:0 "Caesar's Rome is in sight!"

  bhd.18.t:0 "The Miracle in Boulder City"
  bhd.18.d:0 "Boulder City, a small NCR-controlled frontier town sat just behind the Colorado river, should never have posed much of a threat to the Malpais Legate's army. Surrounded on two sides by open ground, and penned in on the other two by harsh ridgelines and the Colorado itself, waves of the Legate's troops should have brushed aside any resistance the NCR put up. Indeed, they did: despite fierce sniper fire from the NCR's rangers, waves of Legion troops forced the mottly NCR defending force to rout within minutes of Legion troops reaching the city.

Dozens of explosive charges laced across Boulder City detonated in unison, followed by sniper fire on anyone who moved. The Legion's defeat was total, and Graham had no choice but to turn his tail and run."
  bhd.18.a:0 "We owe those Rangers a great debt."
  bhd.18.b:0 "Nothing will stop the Legion for long."
  bhd.18.c:0 "An unstable status quo prevails."

Unlike the first time, however, neither Oliver or the Malpais Legate stand unlone. The Legion assault now brings with it the full weight of the Legion's military and industy. Similarly, the NCR itself is mustering troops to march into the Mojave and reinforce the woefully outnumbered Mojave Expedition.
