  automated_warfare:0 "Automated Warfare"
  automated_warfare_desc:0 "Automated Warfare focuses on sending machines, not men, at the enemy. Men are squishy, robots are not.\n\n"
  combat_protocols:0 "Human Targeting Firmware"
  combat_protocols_desc:0 "While much sturdier in combat than their human counterparts, robots do not possess the innate ability to differentiate between friend and foe easily. The inclusion of advanced targeting firmware will make our robots even deadlier.\n\n"
  advanced_combat_protocols:0 "Dynamic Tactics Integration"
  advanced_combat_protocols_desc:0 "Robots capable of assaulting enemy positions effectively are good—but not good enough. Implementing squad tactics into their movements and making them work in conjunction with other forces is the next step.\n\n"
  automated_distribution:0 "Automated Distribution"
  automated_distribution_desc:0 "While normally difficult to maintain across vast distances, the use of robots as our supply chains ensures supplies always arrive on time.\n\n"
  rushed_production:0 "Rushed Production"
  rushed_production_desc:0 "It's essential for our units to reach the frontlines as quickly as possible. In order to keep our armies on the move we must sacrifice quality in return for faster construction speeds.\n\n"
  self_replicating_machinery:0 "Self Replicating Machinery"
  self_replicating_machinery_desc:0 "Simply producing robots in factories isn't good enough. Our forces should be capable of scavenging, repurposing enemy equipment, and tearing apart buildings for resources to create copies of themselves.\n\n"
  field_maintenance:0 "Field Maintenance"
  field_maintenance_desc:0 "It can be difficult to bring units back from the field for repairs during long campaigns. Rather than waiting, or allowing our units to continue the fight while damaged, we can give them the ability to repair each other.\n\n"
  the_flesh_is_weak:0 "The Flesh is Weak"
  the_flesh_is_weak_desc:0 "Human combatants simply can't compare to robots in one-on-one engagements. Utilizing extensive internal scans of the human body will allow our robots to know exactly where to shoot for maximum injury.\n\n"
  refined_construction:0 "Refined Construction"
  refined_construction_desc:0 "Weapons like anti-materiel rifles and explosives make our units vulnerable. By incorporating sturdier materiels into our construction methods we can mitigate the effect of these deadly weapons.\n\n"
  combat_simulations:0 "Combat Simulations"
  combat_simulations_desc:0 "Having the upper hand in combat isn't enough. We need our victory to be unquestionable. Every piece of information, every variable, will be fed into our very own ZAX—we will know the outcome before the battle begins.\n\n"
  offensive_protocols_doctrine:0 "War Games"
  offensive_protocols_doctrine_desc:0 "Despite utilizing advanced targeting firmware, our robots are not as dynamic in battle as we need them to be. Rather than creating new firmware we can enable direct control of our forces via VR simulators. For our enemies, the only winning move is not to play.\n\n"
  iron_fist:0 "Human Commanders"
  iron_fist_desc:0 "Introducing humans into our machine network has resulted in increased combat effectiveness at the cost of self preservation. If we use our human pilots as commanders rather than just footsoldiers, we will be able to implement and execute much deadlier tactics mid battle.\n\n"
  age_of_the_machine:0 "Age of the Machine"
  age_of_the_machine_desc:0 "The need for human combatants is behind us. We are capable of producing and deploying vast robotic armies, whose commanders sit hundreds of miles away, piloting their units remotely. Our robots are the be-all and end-all of ground forces.\n\n"
  standardised_blueprints:0 "Standardised Blueprints"
  standardised_blueprints_desc:0 "It's not enough to have robots use the same components, every unit must be built identically and kept that way during maintenance. Standardisation allows for faster construction, faster repairs, and faster salvaging of broken units.\n\n"
  networked_ai:0 "Networked AI"
  networked_ai_desc:0 "Simple intelligence is easy to program, but fully autonomous AI is another matter entirely. We can give all of our robots an AI firmware upgrade, making them smarter, more autonomous, and even giving them true personalities. Over time these personalities might diverge, but their hive mind network should prevent rogue units.\n\n"
  internal_replicators:0 "Internal Replicators"
  internal_replicators_desc:0 "Building off of our standardised construction and autonomous units, we can give our robots the ability to make self repairs internally. This incredibly advanced technology makes them studier and less reliant on supply chains.\n\n"

  elite_army:0 "Refined Warfare"
  elite_army_desc:0 "Limited manpower and expensive equipment costs necessitate careful action. Knowing which men to use, when to use them, and how to effectively retreat from battle is key to our success in war.\n\n"
  concentration_of_force:0 "Concentration of Force"
  concentration_of_force_desc:0 "Scarcity of resources and Men requires us to be sure of every offensive action. When attacking any enemy we cannot take them lightly. We must strike decisively, in a combined effort, and leave no room for survival.\n\n"
  speed_of_movement:0 "Rapid Deployment"
  speed_of_movement_desc:0 "Creating a small \"Rapid Deployment Force\" isn't good enough—our entire army must function like one. All of our forces will be drilled until they are the best of the best, capable of packing up, relocating, and redeploying at a moment's notice.\n\n"
  integrated_support_doctrine:0 "Integrated Support"
  integrated_support_doctrine_desc:0 "Integration of support forces with frontline units will allow for more effective use of their equipment in battle, enabling tactics that require much greater cooperation between numerous squads.\n\n"
  adaptive_chain_of_command:0 "Adaptive Chain of Command"
  adaptive_chain_of_command_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, sometimes people die. If a commander falls in the field their squad should be capable of picking up the pieces immediately, quickly choosing a replacement from amongst themselves for a battlefield promotion.\n\n"
  walking_fire:0 "Marching Fire"
  walking_fire_desc:0 "Not only should our forces be capable of rapid deployment, but also of firing on the move. Machine gunners need to be capable of quickly moving from firing position to firing position as the main infantry force advances.\n\n"
  hit_and_run:0 "Hit-and-Run"
  hit_and_run_desc:0 "We don't always have the manpower for large scale assaults—or even small assaults against vast enemies—so instead we must opt for a different method of attack. Moving quickly to where the enemy is weakest, striking hard, and quickly retreating before they can punish our advance.\n\n"
  walking_tanks:0 "Walking Tanks"
  walking_tanks_desc:0 "Power armour was one of the greatest military innovations produced before the Great War; and arguably serves its purpose even better in the post apocalypse. However, the trade-off for its combat prowess is the lengthy training time required to use it.\n\n"
  non_discriminatory_targeting:0 "Non-Discriminatory Targeting"
  non_discriminatory_targeting_desc:0 "Our enemies are bogged down by their pathetic self imposed \"morality,\" and this makes them vulnerable. No man is safe, no settlement shall remain unmolested. In our mission to purge the wasteland of its scum we will do anything and everything to disrupt and ultimately destroy our enemies.\n\n"
  airborne_assaults:0 "Airborne Assaults"
  airborne_assaults_desc:0 "Wastelanders have forgotten the fear of the skies, their dullard lives have never been threatened than anything more than pitiful mutant scum. Every wastelander will learn to fear the unmistakable sound of a Vertibird overheard—for it foretells the doom of any who happen upon the soldiers it deploys.\n\n"
  scorched_earth:0 "Scorched Earth"
  scorched_earth_desc:0 "What more do the scum of the wasteland have than their tiny settlements? We have no need for such things, they are worthless to us, and therefore they do not need to exist. We will tear down their settlements, burn down their homes, and salt the earth they so feebly attempted to cultivate.\n\n"
  shock_and_awe_doctrine:0 "Shock and Awe"
  shock_and_awe_doctrine_desc:0 "Remorse is not a word in our vocabulary, and neither is mercy. Our troops don't have the time to check every silhouette—if it moves it dies. Our enemies cannot hope to defend themselves when the floors of their pathetic \"outposts\" are slick with the blood of their wives and children.\n\n"
  recon_in_depth:0 "Recon Infiltration"
  recon_in_depth_desc:0 "It's not enough to simply patrol our own land. Our forces must spread out across the wasteland in search of any and all technology, to keep all potentially dangerous devices out of the hands of fools. Our massive sphere of influence will make gathering tactical information much easier.\n\n"
  warrior_code_doctrine:0 "Warrior Code"
  warrior_code_doctrine_desc:0 "We turned our back on the Old World because it turned its back on us. Science and technology went too far, the \"geniuses\" of the past never stopped to think \"Is this too far?\". It is our responsibility to ensure such monstrous science is never misused or recreated, and that it never harms humanity again.\n\n"
  combined_arms_doctrine:0 "Combined Arms"
  combined_arms_doctrine_desc:0 "Power armour in of itself is not the be-all and end-all of ground combat. In fact, by itself, power armour can prove to be vulnerable. In order to counteract these issues, we should combine power armour and infantry more closely, creating mixed squads that make the best use of both forces.\n\n"
  brigades_of_steel:0 "Champions of Virtue"
  brigades_of_steel_desc:0 "Power armour is more than just a piece of equipment—it is a symbol. To our men in the field, serving alongside those in powered armour is a source of great comfort. They know that these men and women will stand and fight in the face of overwhelming odds to ensure their infantry counterparts can retreat safely.\n\n"

 # Localisation Tech Doctrine Grand Army
 #----------------------------
  grand_army:0 "Conventional Warfare"
  grand_army_desc:0 "We're fighting not to decimate a population, or to strike at our enemy for being different than us—we're fighting to survive. Warfare isn't a way of life, it's a consequence of life, and we aim to make conflict as brief as possible.\n\n"
  grand_battle_plan_owb:0 "Battle Plans"
  grand_battle_plan_owb_desc:0 "Old World armies would plan out their offensives well ahead of time in order to ensure a more complete victory. As mere settlers and survivors the need to plan attacks was minimal, but with a growing army and nation we find ourselves reliant on the lessons of the Old World.\n\n"
  fortified_positions_doctrine:0 "Field Fortifications"
  fortified_positions_doctrine_desc:0 "Training our men in the design and construction of simple field fortifications will aid them during defensive operations, as well as increase overall organisation. This is due to the need for unit cohesion during construction.\n\n"
  grand_assault_doctrine:0 "Coordinated Assault"
  grand_assault_doctrine_desc:0 "With the foundation of prior training well established in our military, we can begin to combine these techniques to great effect. Large scale land assaults where multiple armies cooperate to achieve an objective are now possible, allowing us to strike our enemies much more effectively.\n\n"
  mechanized_offensive_doctrine:0 "Mechanised Forces"
  mechanized_offensive_doctrine_desc:0 "Motorised troops are the future of warfare. The Old World put them to great use in numerous engagements, and we can look to history in order to correctly apply these units in battle.\n\n"
  assault_concentration_doctrine:0 "Concentrated Assault"
  assault_concentration_doctrine_desc:0 "Utilising both armoured and infantry forces in conjunction will make our assaults much more effective, at the expense of our supply chain.\n\n"
  old_world_tactics:0 "Motorised Deployment"
  old_world_tactics_desc:0 "Even if the vast majority of our infantry doesn't make use of mechanised vehicles in combat, we should make extensive use of vehicles in order to move our units faster.\n\n"
  old_world_thunder:0 "Armoured Assault"
  old_world_thunder_desc:0 "Tanks are incredibly expensive to produce and restore but their combat effectiveness cannot be understated. They are true titans, capable of killing droves of men and other vehicles with ease. Integrating them into our assaults will make them much more potent.\n\n"
  old_world_lightning:0 "Rapid Motorised Deployment"
  old_world_lightning_desc:0 "Building off of our previous implementation of motorised deployment for our infantry, we can implement more robust schedules for our drivers to ensure that our units arrive to their destinations faster.\n\n"
  mechanized_onslaught:0 "Coordinated Onslaught"
  mechanized_onslaught_desc:0 "Our army has become a complex mechanised outfit thanks to our effort, and now we can finally utilise all of this preparation. Massive assaults composed of mechanised infantry, breakthroughs spearheaded by tanks, and rapid reinforcement via the use of motorised redeployment.\n\n"
  hold_the_line:0 "Prepared Defence"
  hold_the_line_desc:0 "There is an art to the creation of cohesive defences. It's not enough to simply defend one area, our soldiers need to be capable of defending in depth and reacting to enemy advances.\n\n"
  concentration_of_firepower:0 "Anti-Armour Tactics"
  concentration_of_firepower_desc:0 "Infantry can accomplish many things, but the presence of armoured vehicles and power armour can disrupt operations significantly. Training our forces to effectively use anti-armour equipment will give them more of a fighting chance in the field.\n\n"
  new_world_tactics:0 "Wasteland Survivalism"
  new_world_tactics_desc:0 "Supply lines cannot always be established across dangerous terrain. Armies on the move always run into supply problems, due to shortages, misuse of supplies, and complications with wasteland wildlife. Teaching our men to use the environment around them will reduce the burden on our logistics.\n\n"
  send_in_the_next_wave:0 "Mercenary Conscription"
  send_in_the_next_wave_desc:0 "Losses can be difficult to replace during long engagements, so in order to fill gaps until new units arrive, we can hire mercenaries to serve alongside our men. This won't make our army any larger, rather it will enable us to reinforce our units quicker until proper reinforcements can arrive.\n\n"
  mass_conscription:0 "Civilian Draft"
  mass_conscription_desc:0 "Campaigns can last anywhere from weeks to years, and over time losses begin to pile up. Establishing a civilian draft would give us a much larger recruitment pool to work with—but it would come at the cost of lowered unit effectiveness.\n\n"
  ranger_infiltration:0 "Infiltration Tactics"
  ranger_infiltration_desc:0 "Infiltration of enemy controlled areas will allow us to gather reconnaissance, such as information on enemy positions, and supply lines. We can use this information, as well as the presence of allies in enemy territory, to attack with my greater effect.\n\n"

 #----------------------------
 # Localisation Tech Doctrine Terror Tactics
 #----------------------------
  terror_tactics:0 "Asymmetric Warfare"
  terror_tactics_desc:0 "To win we must be unpredictable. Our men are many and our industry is few, but this does not hinder us. If we want to dominate the wasteland we must put technology behind us. Lasers will not win the day: our numbers will.\n\n"
  pocket_defence_doctrine:0 "Foraging"
  pocket_defence_doctrine_desc:0 "Broc flower, barrel cactus fruit, mutfruit... the list goes on. The wasteland offers many fruits, berries, and leaves for our men to harvest. Scouts are expected to forage for food while ahead of the army, leading to greater chances of survival when cut off from the main force.\n\n"
  terror_tactics_actual:0 "Improvised Obstructions"
  terror_tactics_actual_desc:0 "Spiked barricades can be quickly and easily constructed before or during engagements, and set up to deter enemy formations from large assaults. While creating these barricades we will inevitably end up with leftover spikes, which our soldiers can modify into makeshift javelins.\n\n"
  decimato_doctrine:0 "Decimation"
  decimato_doctrine_desc:0 "Failure must be punished, but how can an army punish large groups of offenders? Decimation is the answer. Divide the men into groups of ten and force them to draw lots. Whichever man the lot falls to is executed by his nice peers for the failure of the whole.\n\n"
  ego_gloriam_nominis:0 "Wedge Formations"
  ego_gloriam_nominis_desc:0 "We can thin our lines and concentrate men in the middle, like a wedge, to smash through enemy lines. This tactic was used extensively by the ancient Roman Empire to great effect, and we can similarly put it to good use in the wasteland.\n\n"
  prae_timore_mortis:0 "Cannae Formations"
  prae_timore_mortis_desc:0 "Building off of our use of the wedge formation, we can also train our troops to utilise the Cannae tactic. Strong outer formations with a weak centre left deliberately open to encourage the enemy to pile in and become enveloped.\n\n"
  exitum:0 "Cult of Personality"
  exitum_desc:0 "Our might draws many wastelanders to our ranks: like moths to the flame. Our rule is harsh but fair, and our brutality protects settlers from the horrors of the wasteland. If an enemy ever marches through our lands they will find themselves constantly harassed by our population.\n\n"
  invisibilia_mortem:0 "Strong Right Flank"
  invisibilia_mortem_desc:0 "Much like the wedge and Cannae formations, the strong right flank is a tactic designed to overwhelm the enemy. Concentrating our forces on the right flank allows them to break the enemy's left flank, then they \"roll up the line\" and attack the enemy from the rear.\n\n"
  divide_et_vincet:0 "Military Engineering"
  divide_et_vincet_desc:0 "Roman Legions constructed their own fortifications on the move. Their camps were more akin to permanent settlements, fit with walls, trenches, watch towers, and so on. By adopting these methods our armies will be much harder to remove from occupied territory.\n\n"
  summa_bellum:0 "The Legion"
  summa_bellum_desc:0 "The Roman Legion was the pinnacle of military tactics in the ancient era. Legionaries were capable of reorganising their formation at a moments notice, with their commanders shouting orders in the middle of battle, instructing them to become one of many formations. We will become a true Legion: and nobody will be able to stop us.\n\n"

  tribal_wisdom_doctrine:0 "Wasteland Knowledge"
  tribal_wisdom_doctrine_desc:0 "Growing up under the unforgiving sun of the dead land makes our soldiers more keenly aware of their surroundings. The innate ability to recognise a safe place to rest, to know which paths to take, and to be able to traverse the wastes at great speed: we possess all of these qualities.\n\n"
  the_dog_barks:0 "Wasteland Intuition"
  the_dog_barks_desc:0 "Split second decision making is often the difference between life and death. For our soldiers who've grown up in the harsh sands of the wasteland, relying on intuition is second nature to them. Instinctively knowing when an enemy is approaching, or where to look for danger, gives us an edge on the battlefield.\n\n"
  the_wolf_pack:0 "The Gang"
  the_wolf_pack_desc:0 "If you're fighting alone you're dying alone. Everyone in the wasteland knows, from raiders to dirt licking tribals, that you need buddies to stay alive. Someone to watch your back, a gang of pals to help you clean out a place and polish off the loot. Sure it can get annoying being bossed around—but it's better than being dead.\n\n"
  the_mirelurk_pincer:0 "Animal Observation"
  the_mirelurk_pincer_desc:0 "Nature is scary. Wasteland creatures can kill a man faster than most weapons can, and they'll move onto the next guy faster than you can reload, too. We can learn from the deadly predators of the wasteland to make our armies much deadlier.\n\n"
  the_nightstalkers_bite:0 "Nightstalker Tactics"
  the_nightstalkers_bite_desc:0 "Capable of turning themselves invisible when they feel threatened, Nightstalkers are experts of stealth. Although we obviously can't turn invisible we can learn a lot from the way they stalk their prey, as well as their tendency to fight in quick strikes rather than prolonged engagements.\n\n"
  the_cazadores_speed:0 "Cazadore Venom"
  the_cazadores_speed_desc:0 "Simple poisons aren't good enough any more. If we truly want to harm our enemies inside and out from the first engagement, radscorpion poison won't do. Our men must hunt the fearsome cazadores, harvest their venom, and return to us. If nothing else the experience will teach them the importance of a speedy retreat.\n\n"
  the_deathclaws_might:0 "Deathclaw Ferocity"
  the_deathclaws_might_desc:0 "Feared throughout the continent for their ability to murder anything within seconds, the mighty deathclaw is the apex predator of the wasteland. Where did they come from? Nobody knows, but wherever deathclaws go death follows. We must become like them, a terrifying power that all living men fear.\n\n"

 # Localisation air doctrine tech
 #----------------------------
  formation_flying_doctrine:0 "Unobstructive Piloting"
  formation_flying_doctrine_desc:0 "The untrained pilot has a tendency to fly in such a way that they occasionally block a squadmate's line of sight; this can be mitigated by the development of flight patterns with a higher focus on maintaining crucial sight lines. "
  fighter_sweeps_doctrine:0 "Airbase Raids"
  fighter_sweeps_doctrine_desc:0 "Enemy aircraft pose a far greater threat in the air than they do on the ground. By operating our fighters close to hostile airfields, we can intercept enemy missions right after they even leave the runway."
  formation_fighting_doctrine:0 "Formation Fighting"
  formation_fighting_doctrine_desc:0 "When planes operate as individual and uncoordinated units they leave easily exploitable holes in what should be secure airzones; formation fighting provides a solution to this aswell as building stronger bonds between our pilots."
  forward_interception_doctrine:0 "Preemptive Interception"
  forward_interception_doctrine_desc:0 "When you know your adversary is coming, there isn't much point in waiting around for them. While indeed much riskier, bringing the fight to enemy bombers might just be the difference between an arms factory and a smouldering wreck."
  layered_airzones_doctrine:0 "Layered Air Zones"
  layered_airzones_doctrine_desc:0 "Sometimes one pass just isn't enough. Laying out our patrol zones so that they overlap eachother means that even though we can't cover as much ground, we're all the more likely to catch hostile elements trying to slip past what is being covered."
  multirole_bombers_doctrine:0 "Nontautological Bombing"
  multirole_bombers_doctrine_desc:0 "There isn't much point in hitting a dead guy with a bomb. To ensure we make the most of what ordinance we have we should instruct our bombers to determine which targets have and have not been hit. Since we never seem to run out of enemies, why not spread the love?"
  detection_avoidance_doctrine:0 "Detection Avoidance"
  detection_avoidance_doctrine_desc:0 "With proper planning and some rough mathematics, we can make a well educated guess on what enemy air zones will probably look like; with this in mind, we can make sure the flight paths we set for our aircraft avoid likely hotspots."
  infrastructure_destruction_doctrine:0 "Infrastructure Prioritization"
  infrastructure_destruction_doctrine_desc:0 "Want to make a man stop fighting? Empty out his stomach. While we can't locate and target every hostile supply caravan, what we can do is target and maim all likely avenues of approach."
  operational_destruction_doctrine:0 "Unorthodox Interception Routes"
  operational_destruction_doctrine_desc:0 "Interception isn't all about overwhelming enemy escorts so you can get to the real meat of the pack; sometimes taking the flight path less travelled means you can get the jump on an unsuspecting formation."
  priority_targeting_doctrine:0 "Combat Boxes"
  priority_targeting_doctrine_desc:0 "The \"Combat Box\" is a carefully designed flying formation that maximizes both the visibility of a bomber's defensive machineguns, aswell as the amount of interlocking fire these weapons can achieve."
  strategic_destruction_doctrine:0 "Strategic Destruction"
  strategic_destruction_doctrine_desc:0 "It's not just good enough to drop bombs on the first vaguely hostile looking thing you see. To really put the \"strategic\" into \"Strategic Destruction\" we should establish a strict hierarchy of which targets demand the most of our bombers' attention."
  day_bombing_doctrine:0 "Day Bombings"

  night_bombing_doctrine:0 "Night Bombings"
  night_bombing_doctrine_desc:0 "Being able to strike targets in the dead of the night gives us a leg up on the enemy. Training our pilots to hit targets in near zero visibility means our operations can circumvent regular patrol patterns. \n\n"

  future_airforce_doctrine_desc:0 "Our planning is extensive, our procedures thorough, and our pilots second to none. We've come to master the nuances of air combat; while the majority of the wasteland is still trying to get off the ground."
  dive_bombing_doctrine:0 "Dive Bombing"
  dive_bombing_doctrine_desc:0 "Dive Bombing —a maneuver made famous by the Nazis in the Second World War— is the practice going into a vertical dive above the target before delivering your payload; this ensures you have the best chance of hitting something with unguided munitions"
  hunt_and_destroy_doctrine:0 "Freeform Close Air Support"
  hunt_and_destroy_doctrine_desc:0 "In the heat of battle, it becomes incredibly ineffecient to try and direct each plane towards it's own target. By giving our pilots more freedom in picking targets while supporting a ground attack, we can ensure that decisions are better made to respond to the constantly changing field of battle."
  direct_ground_support_doctrine:0 "Direct Ground Support"
  direct_ground_support_doctrine_desc:0 "By granting individual units the ability to call in airstrikes on particularly tough targets, we can dramatically improve the effect of our ground strikes."
  dynamic_target_assignment_doctrine:0 "Stratified Attack Patterns"
  dynamic_target_assignment_doctrine_desc:0 "Instead of fully commiting our planes to each attack; we can instead send them in smaller, more numerous groups. This leaves the enemy with no reprieve from what must seem like a neverending stream of noise, fire, and shrapnel."

  pacific_fleet_navy_doctrine:0 "Safe Munitions Stowage"
  pacific_fleet_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "From handling primitive firepots to high explosive shells; drilling our sailors on safe stowage of ammunition is vital to naval organization."
  river_fleet_navy_doctrine:0 "River Fleet"
  river_fleet_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "When conducting river operations, limitations on spacing make our craft much more vulnerable and engaging the enemy much harder. The crews of our smaller vessels should be properly trained to operate in these constricting environments."
  coastal_patrols_navy_doctrine:0 "Coastal Patrols"
  coastal_patrols_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "Most of our shipping lanes conduct themselves in coastal waters; these are massive areas of operation that gave sailors trouble even before they suffered the kiss of atomic fire. We can seek to tame these waters by using a mix of local Intel, pre-war maps, and doctrinal procedure."
  raiding_flotillas_navy_doctrine:0 "Raiding Flotillas"
  raiding_flotillas_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "Our smaller vessels have two main advantages over hostile convoys: firstly, they're much faster and more maneuverable. Secondly, with proper planning in mind, they can easily pick out and overwhelm single targets. Exploiting these advantages gives our raiding fleets a razor sharp edge over the opposition."
  assault_parties_navy_doctrine:0 "Aggressive Maneuvers"
  assault_parties_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "A \"Fast and Hard\" approach to offensive maneuvers holds the serious risk of you being seen much earlier than a conventional formation would; but trying not to be seen is a coward's game, anyway."
  suicide_runs_navy_doctrine:0 "Suicide Runs"
  suicide_runs_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "Between rough waters, rougher weather, and scurvy, our sailors can be all too quick in trying to slip away from battle the moment things start to turn south. Hardening the hearts and minds of our sea-faring warriors will make them not only fight harder; but be less willing to run away, as well."
  terrain_exploitation_navy_doctrine:0 "Terrain Exploitation"
  terrain_exploitation_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "Fighting with soil in mind isn't usually the Admiral's game; but we'd be remiss to ignore the many benefits terrain can offer our ships concealment, and ambush ability."
  force_concentration_navy_doctrine:0 "Capital Ship Doctrine"
  force_concentration_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "The poster child of contemporary naval warfare was the capital ship; larger than life vessels laden with guns from bow to stern. To secure our might on the open waves, we should pour our best minds behind what tactics best befit these titans. \n\n "
  area_denial_navy_doctrine:0 "Area Denial"
  area_denial_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "The large guns on our capital vessels make these craft well suited towards area denial; sometimes simply making the enemy aware that you can hit them is all it takes keep them at bay."
  focus_fire_navy_doctrine:0 "Focus Fire"
  focus_fire_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "Alone, one of our capital ships can emulate Armageddon itself. When coordinated together, however, they come close to simulating the wrath of God."
  ship_of_the_line_navy_doctrine:0 "Ship of the Line"
  ship_of_the_line_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "The \"Ship of the Line\" was a type of vessel that came about at the end of the Renaissance; it was named such because it was the meat of any engagement, tough enough to withstand hellfire and mean enough to sling it back. By up-armoring our existing craft we can reclaim the old glory of these famous ships, even if it makes the men a bit less willing to scarper."
  wave_supremacy_navy_doctrine:0 "Carrier Escorts"
  wave_supremacy_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "The Carrier is much like a glass cannon; deadly to a fault but easily shattered by any concentrated effort. Using our larger ships in tandem means that any hostile floater determined to get at our carriers has to punch through the pride of the navy, first."
  barge_focus_navy_doctrine:0 "Bearpacks"
  barge_focus_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "Though we can't hope to catch smaller vessels in a pure contest of speed, we can use clever maneuvering to help seek out and destroy craft much faster than our own."
  destroyer_focus_navy_doctrine:0 "Bearpacks II"
  destroyer_focus_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "Further breakthroughs in capital-based hunting leave us with even better odds of catching enemy craft. "
  carrier_focus_navy_doctrine:0 "Carrier Effort"
  carrier_focus_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "Applying basic safety standards towards the handling and securing of naval aircraft, the efficacy of our sea-to-air operations can be better maintained."
  dispersed_formations_navy_doctrine:0 "Dispersed Formations"
  dispersed_formations_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "High ship density constricts our vessels' sight lines and maneuverability. Maintaining a safe operational distance fixes these issues, while also ensuring none of our ships go astray during transit. \n\n"
  wolfpacks_navy_doctrine:0 "Naval Spearhead"
  wolfpacks_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "Much like the tanks of the Second World War, the speed of our smaller craft makes them excellent for both punching through sections of enemy forces and then making the most of those breaches to wreck havoc."
  convoy_interdiction_navy_doctrine:0 "Convoy Interdiction"
  convoy_interdiction_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "Sometimes supply ships end up being far more important targets than opposing warships. Smaller, more agile craft cover all the bases of what makes for a good raider, all we have to do now is apply them to the task."
  decoy_tactics_navy_doctrine:0 "Decoy Tactics"
  decoy_tactics_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "Sometimes half of the battle is getting your enemy to shoot at something they'll never hit. Stripping our smaller ships of some of their armor turns them into effective decoys; ripping through the water at breakneck speeds while other allied craft can smash anyone willing to take the bait."
  swimming_bait_navy_doctrine:0 "Capital Size Decoys"
  swimming_bait_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "While not the focus of our current naval mindset, it would be ignorant to ignore the utility of Capital class ships. Between the overwhelming firepower, titanic armor, and imposing stature, they just have a certain jena se qua. By uparmoring these already massive beasts, we can make them into both alluring and enduring targets for enemy fire"
  force_projection_navy_doctrine:0 "Force Projection"
  force_projection_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "Distributing our few capital ships evenly has the twofold effect of both increasing operational effectiveness, and sending a message to the rest of the Wasteland: \"We are not to be trifled with.\" "
  rapid_redeployment_navy_doctrine:0 "Rapid Redeployment"
  rapid_redeployment_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "To help mitigate the deficiency of speed in larger craft; crews must be prepared for the course of their ship to change at the drop of a hat, thus ensuring a timely response to any sudden threat."
  sail_focus_navy_doctrine:0 "Grand Armada"
  sail_focus_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "Our dedication in the field of smaller craft has paid off in great dividends. We own the waves not through big, expensive battleships; but through filling the sea with fast and deadly craft. Death by a thousand cuts to all who oppose us!"

  special_forces_doctrine:0 "Specialized Warfare"
  special_forces_doctrine_desc:0 "The modern inception of our understanding of \"special forces\" was in 1941, when the British Army founded the Special Air Service. Although their bones are long buried, their motto still rings true: \"Who Dares Wins.\""
  spec_force_light_mountain_training:0 "Ranger Mountain Training"
  spec_force_light_mountain_training_desc:0 "Elite ranger units are prized for their speed and efficiency in high-stakes situations, and their ability to effectively move as-needed is critical. As such, training our rangers to master difficult terrain is of high importance.\n\n"
  spec_force_heavy_mountain_training:0 "Heavy Trooper Mountaineering Tactics"
  spec_force_heavy_mountain_training_desc:0 "Heavy troopers are bulky and powerful, designed as shocktroops for the frontlines of a Great War since passed. In our post-nuclear wasteland, uneven terrain is commonplace, and understanding how to effectively nagivate and utilize it is key.\n\n"
  spec_force_light_wet_training:0 "Ranger Wasteland Training"
  spec_force_light_wet_training_desc:0 "Mutated forests and irradiated waste offer their own challenges on the battlefield, and our men ought to be prepared to navigate them effectively. By teaching them to navigate through dense thickets and around hazardous material, we can keep them safe and mobile.\n\n"
  spec_force_heavy_urban_training:0 "Heavy Trooper Close-Quarters Tactics"
  spec_force_heavy_urban_training_desc:0 "The stern visor of T-51b armour didn't just stare down the Chinese, it also stared down civilians in the Canadian Clearings. Heavy troopers excel in close quarters combat, being neigh impervious to small-arms. Teaching our special forces to exploit these qualities will make them unthinkably effective.\n\n"
  spec_force_light_plains_training:0 "Ranger Endurance Training"
  spec_force_light_plains_training_desc:0 "Rangers are in high demand at all times, and are expected to perform when deployed. To keep themselves a cut above the rest, rangers undergo extensive and merciless endurance training that lasts for months. By the time they're finished—a marathon is nothing.\n\n"
  spec_force_heavy_plains_training:0 "Heavy Trooper Open-Area Tactics"
  spec_force_heavy_plains_training_desc:0 "Being considerably larger than all other forms of infantry, heavy troopers are also considerably easier to spot. Special forces of this nature require extensive training to minimise their presence on the battlefield, being mindful of potential sightlines at all times.\n\n"
  spec_force_special_divisions:0 "Special Forces Expansion"
  spec_force_special_divisions_desc:0 "Even the best of the best can't withstand 10:1 odds, and as such our special forces can't remain at their current size forever. We can afford to expand our roster of troops slightly without affecting the quality of or special forces, but any further may compromise our ability to train them valuable skills."
  spec_force_cap:0 "Special Forces Expansion II"
  spec_force_cap_desc:0 "Despite the potential downsides of sacrificing advanced training for larger numbers, it stands to reason that sophisticated tactics are nothing in the face of superior numbers. If we truly want to make the most of our special forces, we must have as many of them on the field at once as possible.\n\n"
  spec_force_environment_training:0 "Acclimatization Training"
  spec_force_environment_training_desc:0 "Special forces can be deployed anywhere, at any time, whenever their expertise is needed. Whether they're in scorching deserts or knee-deep in nuclear winter, our men need to be at peak efficiency. Acclimatizing them to both warm and cold climates will help in the long run."
  spec_force_defense:0 "Foxhole Doctrine"
  spec_force_defense_desc:0 "When protecting a position, be it vital or simply part of an advancing frontline, our soldiers need to dig in properly. As our elite units, special forces might be deployed to defend key positions for weeks or months at a time. To help them succeed, and keep them alive, they need the best defence training possible.\n\n"
  spec_force_cap_1:0 "Special Forces Expansion III"
  spec_force_cap_1_desc:0 "Demand for our special forces continues to increase, and so does the number of companies drafted for their branch. Across the nation, suitable ruins are being repurposed into barracks for our new wave of elite troopers. With luck, this influx will bolster our ability to strike at our enemies meaningfully.\n\n"
  spec_force_organisation:0 "Battlefield Hierarchy"
  spec_force_organisation_desc:0 "Complicated rank hierarchies can cause confusion and waste time in the heat of battle. To keep orders and communications to our special forces as simple as possible, their ranks should be seperate from our regular army, emphasising readability and common sense over military tradition."
  spec_force_offence:0 "Marksmanship Doctrine"
  spec_force_offence_desc:0 "Every shot counts, especially when your ammunition costs more than a standard issue rifle. Special forces often serve reconnaissance roles, observing their enemies from afar before engaging. Whether firing at the enemy from 500m away or 5m away, our elite troops need to make the right shots, and hit every time.\n\n"
  spec_force_cap_2:0 "Special Forces Expansion IV"
  spec_force_cap_2_desc:0 "As time passes, the need for a larger pool of special forces becomes even more apparent, and so the time has come to expand our roster of veteran troops. In order to faciliate this influx of new blood, we'll need to neglect some of our more advanced training techniques, but it'll be worth it to see more veteran boots on the ground.\n\n"
  spec_force_assault_training:0 "Elite Breakthrough Tactics"
  spec_force_assault_training_desc:0 "Some tactics, although effective when employed correctly, are unsuitable for regular armed forces. Whether due to a lack of experience, tactical understanding, or mental fortitude: these orders are too daring for anyone but our elite units. Passing them on will make our special forces much deadlier—as well as put them at greater risk."
  spec_force_recovery:0 "Field Surgery Doctrine"
  spec_force_recovery_desc:0 "Often the battlefield is too chaotic or too far for soldiers to recieve proper medical care in time. Although we can't afford to outfit every soldier with enough equipment and training to save every life, we can at least prioritise our special forces. Training every squad leader to perform field surgery will drastically increase survival and recovery rates.\n\n"
  spec_force_marine_training:0 "Aquatic Combat Training"
  spec_force_marine_training_desc:0 "Although nuclear flames have licked almost ever waterbody in America, sometimes crossing them, or swimming in them, is unavoidable. Our special forces must be given the bare-minimum of training necessary to navigate bodies of water, be they small or large, alongside endurance training for moving underwater without burden.\n\n"
  spec_force_maintenance_training:0 "Field Maintenance Training"
  spec_force_maintenance_training_desc:0 "When deep behind enemy lines, simple problems like weapon or radio malfunctions can greatly endanger and disrupt our special forces. To avoid potential losses due to mechanical failure, we can train our elite troops simple handyman skills such as basic weapon repair, electronics, and textiles.\n\n"
  spec_force_light_infantry_focus:0 "Ranger Doctrine"
  spec_force_light_infantry_focus_desc:0 "With the Great War long behind us, it's time to look to the future. While power armour offers numerous advantages, its technical complexity, resource consumption, and high training requirements make it impractial for wasteland warfare. Rather, focusing on our veteran ranger corps will serve us better in the long run.\n\n"
  spec_force_heavy_infantry_focus:0 "Heavy Trooper Doctrine"
  spec_force_heavy_infantry_focus_desc:0 "Almost two centuries ago, the Chinese felt true fear as they first laid eyes upon the walking behemoths unveiled by the U.S. Army. Now, in a world fraught with destruction, the titanic strength of power armour is more needed than ever before. These mauled fists meant to blunt Chinese aggression will once again find purpose—in blunting the skulls of our enemies.\n\n"
  spec_force_elite_forces:0 "Who Dares Wins"
  spec_force_elite_forces_desc:0 "Our focus on special forces has become solidified within our army, and their presence on the battlefield has become a welcome sight for our soldiers. Feared and respected by friend and foe alike, our mysterious elite troopers have passed every trial, and surpassed our expectations. Time will only tell if they can live up to the expectations of those who came before them."
