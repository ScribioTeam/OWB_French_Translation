  lac_battle_of_marathon_desc:0 "And the Persians, who saw the Athenians advancing toward them on the double, prepared to meet their attack; they assumed that the Athenians were seized by some utterly self-destructive madness, but they won. They chose not to reduce let their city fall to slavery; they ensured its freedom and left a memorial to all posterity.  So standing on a Persian's grave, can you deem yourself a slave?"

  lac_building_a_true_legion_desc:0 "Soldier, what I have to offer you is fatigue, danger, struggle and death; the chill of the cold night in the free air, and heat under the burning sun; no lodgings, no munitions, no provisions, but forced marches, dangerous watch-posts and the continual struggle with the bayonet against batteries;- - those who love freedom may follow me."

  lac_edict_of_caracalla_desc:0 "It is most fitting that, as I ascribe the causes and the reasons of fate to the gods, I should give thanks to them for their faith in me. So let me make my offerings to the gods with the foreigners who have served with me,and grant all subjects of the Legion the title of citizen.  For is it not right and proper that all should share in my glory, to enhance the majesty of the people?"

  lac_war_prep_2:0 "The Band of Brothers"
  lac_war_prep_2_desc:0 "Caesar asks you to fight for his glory, and for his cause. But you should fight for your glory. For this is not a triumph for me. It is a triumph for all who fight with me. My victory is yours, and yours is mine."

  lac_war_prep_4_desc:0 "The men and women who supply my forces are a humourless lot, but, then, they know that if I lose, they will be the first I slay.  but that is because the line between victory and defeat, all too often, depends on logistics."
