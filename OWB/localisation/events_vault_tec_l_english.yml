  nf_vault_tec.1.t:0 "Vault 3 Survey"
  nf_vault_tec.1.d:0 "Vault 3 is partially flooded, and the Fiends' occupation of the vault has not helped its state. Establishing an outpost here would not be impossible, but a much easier prospect would be to repair the water purification systems for export to the rest of our settlements."
  nf_vault_tec.1.a:0 "Use the water for our existing settlements."
  nf_vault_tec.1.b:0 "Renovate the Vault and establish a settlement."

  nf_vault_tec.2.t:0 "Vault 6 Survey"
  nf_vault_tec.2.d:0 "Clearing out the vault of the ghoul infestation that has plagued it for almost two centuries cost us more than a few members of the security team. However, Vault 6 seems to be perfectly intact, and could be used either as a new settlement or as a production center."
  nf_vault_tec.2.a:0 "Repurpose for production."
  nf_vault_tec.2.b:0 "Establish a settlement."

  nf_vault_tec.3.t:0 "Vault 13 Survey"
  nf_vault_tec.3.d:0 "Vault 13 is still riddled with the bodies of the deathclaws and vault dwellers that had marked its forced abandonment. There is, however, a half used G.E.C.K. We could use the G.E.C.K. to turn this vault into a proper settlement, or use it to accelerate out research."
  nf_vault_tec.3.a:0 "Use the G.E.C.K. for research."
  nf_vault_tec.3.b:0 "Establish a settlement."
  nf_vault_tec.3.c:0 "Let the Arroyo tribe return to their ancestral home and keep the G.E.C.K."

  nf_vault_tec.4.t:0 "Vault 15 Survey"
  nf_vault_tec.4.d:0 "Vault 15 is the origin of Shady Sands and the Great Khans, and has housed raider gangs, vault dwellers, and NCR citizens. The years have not been kind to her, however, and between the NCR's looting and its not so savoury inhabitants prior, its in poor condition. To return Vault 15 to livable standards, we would need to use a good amount of our existing infrastructure to relay foundation and replace the more electronics intensive parts. An alternative, however, would be to make sure the vault is safe to enter, and simply open it as a heritage site for both wastelanders and vault dwellers alike."
  nf_vault_tec.4.a:0 "Make it a Heritage Site."
  nf_vault_tec.4.b:0 "Rebuild the Vault and establish a settlement"

  nf_vault_tec.5.t:0 "Vault 19 Survey"
  nf_vault_tec.5.d:0 "Vault 19 was the site of an experiment in social separation, separating the vault dwellers into two separate groups. The experiment failed, however, due to a huge sulphur deposit that contaminated their air supply."
  nf_vault_tec.5.a:0 "Use the sulphur deposits for explosives."
  nf_vault_tec.5.b:0 "Blow the sulphur and establish a settlement."

  nf_vault_tec.6.t:0 "Vault 21 Survey"
  nf_vault_tec.6.d:0 "The residents of Vault 21 gambled ownership of their Vault away to Mr House. He cruelly expelled them from their home and filled a good part of it in with concrete. However, he allowed a few of the citizens to set up a thriving market industry."
  nf_vault_tec.6.a:0 "Incorporate the local economy."
  nf_vault_tec.6.b:0 "Return the Vault to working order."

  nf_vault_tec.7.t:0 "Removing the Infestation"
  nf_vault_tec.7.d:0 "The lost contact with the survey team is now the least of our problems. A plant based infection was sealed within Vault 22, and has infected them. We could either set up a quarantine area and try to research the effects of the infection, or we could clear the mess out."
  nf_vault_tec.7.a:0 "Research the Infection."
  nf_vault_tec.7.b:0 "Send in a Clearance Team."
  nf_vault_tec.7.c:0 "Break out the Flamers."

  nf_vault_tec.8.t:0 "Vault 34"
  nf_vault_tec.8.d:0 "Vault 34 was abandoned by what became the Boomers around 50 years ago, and they have inhabited Nellis Air Force Base ever since. They are severely distrusting of everyone, but with the grace of their leader they have allowed a diplomatic mission to speak to them. Vault 34 itself, however, is suffering from a reactor leak, and is inhabited by ghouls. We could either approach the Boomers and give them control of the surrounding lands, giving us a powerful regional ally we share origins with, or repair the severe reactor leak, kill the ghouls, and secure the vault as an outpost in the area."
  nf_vault_tec.8.a:0 "Repair the Vault."
  nf_vault_tec.8.b:0 "Bring the Boomers into the fold."

  nf_vault_tec.9.t:0 "Vault 70 Survey"
  nf_vault_tec.9.d:0 "Vault 70 was given three GECKs, and used them to great effect creating the Mormon nation of New Canaan. The Vault is rife with valuable social data, between the social experiment the vault was tasked with to the cultural development afterwards. All of this data, sadly, is on an ageing mainframe located in the ruins of the vault itself. we can either renovate the vault, most likely damaging the mainframe in the process, or we turn the old vault into a cultural research center, hoping to rescue as much data as possible from the failing mechanisms."
  nf_vault_tec.9.a:0 "Rebuild the Vault."
  nf_vault_tec.9.b:0 "Research the data left in the vault's mainframe."

  nf_vault_tec.10.t:0 "Clearance Team Report"
  nf_vault_tec.10.d:0 "Clearance of Vault 22 has gone disastrously. While the team has managed to clear all of the plant life and mutants from the vault, they themselves have become infected. An apology, then the sounds of several 10mm pistol shots echo through the radio, followed by silence."
  nf_vault_tec.10.a:0 "Their sacrifice was noble."

  nf_vault_tec.11.t:0 "Vault 29 Survey"
  nf_vault_tec.11.d:0 "Not far from the villages of the Twin Mothers tribe, themselves made up of the descendants of vault dwellers, sits a non functioning vault-tec facility. A master control console for the ZAX supercomputer this vault was equipped with stands in a low power state. The computer terminal yields two options: Re-establish Satlink or Restore ZAX defaults."
  nf_vault_tec.11.a:0 "Re-establish Satlink."
  nf_vault_tec.11.b:0 "Restore Defaults."

  nf_vault_tec.12.t:0 "Fate of the Vault"
  nf_vault_tec.12.d:0 "With the matter of the supercomputer settled, the choice of what to do with the remaining Twin Mothers and the Vault must be made. We could give them citizenship and establish ourselves an outpost in the vault, or we could give them some autonomy."
  nf_vault_tec.12.a:0 "Establish a Settlement."
  nf_vault_tec.12.b:0 "Give them Autonomy."
