   caps_raider_events.22.d: "We have repelled multiple raiding parties from §R[FROM.FROM.GetName]§! It seems like they wanted to slip by unnoticed between border patrols, thankfully our boys sure know how to shoot, and sent them back to their pitiful land with many busted kneecaps."

   caps_raider_events.31.d: "We raided §R[FROM.FROM.FROM.GetName]§!, those idiots never saw it coming, and we got to get away with mountains of cap to spend! If all jobs were that easy i'd already be retired, if i didn't enjoy burning stuff down so much."
