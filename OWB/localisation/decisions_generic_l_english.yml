  prioritise_living_standards: "Prioritise Living Standards"
  prioritise_living_standards_desc: "It is by no means a stretch to say our people live in good conditions. They do not. The people are in need of some care and attention from us, so better now than later! The changes will be slow, but we'll get to a more stable society in time."
  research_consumer_tech: "Prioritise Consumer Technology"
  research_consumer_tech_desc: "Our R&D department is of the utmost importance to our nation. It develops new armour and weapons, upgrades old versions and modifiers what we find in the waste.

  basic_hygiene_education: "Basic Hygiene Education"

The people will undoubtedly be happy at this change."

  extend_mil_production: "Emergency Military Production"
