  aztec_wasps:0 "W.A.S.P."
  aztec_wasps_desc:0 "The Wartime Azlanti Serf Participation act, or W.A.S.P for short, is a simple piece of legislation that allows for indebted citizens, or those who have fallen into serfdom, to wipe away their debt by enlisting in the lesser cores of the Azlanti Military. Most citizens understand that those who accept the wasp rarely return. Apparently the Act was written in English because the Empress said this would be really funny."

  aztlan_land_distribution:0 "Inefficient Agricultural Practices"
  aztlan_land_distribution_desc:0 "The Aztlán Empire is dominated by inefficient landholdings run by a nobility that focuses on personal excess instead of capital growth. This hinders the growth of the empire's internal market and is perhaps its greatest roadblock to greatness."

  ate_lords_atlzani1:0 "The Lords of the Aztláni"
  ate_lords_atlzani1_desc:0 "The Aztlán Empire's primary industrial concern is to feed its massive population on its somewhat limited farmland. Because of this, heavy industry and commerce have always been given a secondary priority. Rafael Cuāuhtli sees no better course of action than to hand more funding and power to these organizations and families, so that they might better do that which they were already doing. \n\nIdiot."
