 ttm_the_nursery_desc:9 "Hidden away from mankind's madness, its ambitions, and even the wasteland itself, lies the Nursery. Decades of pre-war construction efforts, years of research, months of the most minute changes and refinement all lead to this secret paradise, an untouched garden of Eden, and the last serene place in the wasteland."
 ttm_the_command_station:9 "The Command Station"
 ttm_the_command_station_desc:9 "At the heart of the nursery, the Command Station lies. A state-of-the-art mainframe manned by advanced Robobrains, it processes billions of lines of information and strategical intel in its mainframes. Bringing it back online and properly integrating it into our command will considerably help our future efforts."

 ttm_harder_better_faster_stronger_desc:9 "Now that we have made sure the Twin Mothers tribe is healthy and strong, we could use our robotics knowledge to go beyond the human form. Volunteers will be given capabilities beyond even their wildest dreams, while we experiment with the next step in human evolution. Cybernetics."
 ttm_the_repository:9 "The Repository"
 ttm_the_repository_desc:9 "The Repository, a secondary wing of The Factory, is the DNA database it uses to manufacture the numerous biological components needed to provide for The Nursery. Expanding it further and allowing for tertiary wings dedicated to new samples as well as active research could open new avenues of research into wasteland fauna and flora."
 ttm_collecting_specimens:9 "Collecting Specimens"
 ttm_collecting_specimens_desc:9 "The inauguration of the tertiary wing of the Repository will now allow us to properly store irradiated DNA samples taken from wasteland fauna, and with it also comes new scientific facilities to process said samples. All this could result in the future possibility of even integrating useful DNA strands into willing citizens!"
 ttm_molerat_dna:9 "Molerat DNA"
 ttm_molerat_dna_desc:9 "Molerat samples that our troops have acquired have become extremely interesting for our engineering divisions. It seems like we can integrate the common trait of 'earth sensing' into our sapper units without all the side effects that would come from molerat-DNA. This will make them able to more easily find defensible positions and entrench faster."
 ttm_fire_ant_dna:9 "Fire Ant DNA"
 ttm_fire_ant_dna_desc:9 "The Fire Ant's genetical sequence and its potential application mostly pertain to its intrinsic understanding of its fellow ants, as well as organization in group. And while it would be horrifying to try and integrate a hive-like mentality, we can still splice more common trait like intrinsic body language understanding and pheromone dispersion."
 ttm_gecko_dna:9 "Gecko DNA"
 ttm_gecko_dna_desc:9 "Analysing and decoding the FEV-tainted genetical sequence of the Gecko was an extremely hard process that we thankfully managed to complete. It seems like it went through several rapid mutations during multiple generations, because of the virus. Splicing its DNA would make our people taller and faster, but also a lot more fertile."
 ttm_brahmin_dna:9 "Brahmin DNA"
 ttm_brahmin_dna_desc:9 "The hardy Brahmin which, from our analysis, seems to be a post-war descendant of the Brahmin cattle breed that could help in our early efforts for human experimentation. While we wouldn't go as far as integrating its eight-compartment stomach into our population, we could make do with its lessened need for water and improved digestion."
 ttm_advanced_specimens:9 "Advanced Specimens"
 ttm_advanced_specimens_desc:9 "The amount of sample we've collected is truly staggering, but our current splicing and sequencing capabilities can only do so much. Additional facilities shall be constructed and dedicated entirely to genetical experiments, as well as the storage of additional DNA sequences to further enhance our population."
 ttm_mirelurk_dna:9 "Mirelurk DNA"
 ttm_mirelurk_dna_desc:9 "Mirelurks have a much better natural understanding of the waves and aquatic environment that we could ever hope to. Its acquired DNA can still, however, be spliced and integrated into the population for better aquatic mobility as well as the ability to see correctly during dives even without goggles."
 ttm_radscorpion_dna:9 "Radscorpion DNA"
 ttm_radscorpion_dna_desc:9 "The Radscorpion's natural resistance to the direct light of the sun, as well as the heat or dryness of the air, makes its sequence perfectly suited for low-level splicing into all our citizens. Doing so will make them more hardy in desert-like climates, and have them enjoy increased comfort in most circumstances."
 ttm_wanamingo_dna:9 "Wanamingo DNA"
 ttm_wanamingo_dna_desc:9 "The mystic Wanamingo has its history surrounded by stories, tales and fables. The only thing we can be sure of, is that whatever that thing is, it definitively was engineered. We have found traces of biological weaponry manipulation pertaining once again to the FEV virus. Whatever the case, its strength and endurance could be spliced into our citizens."
 ttm_rumble_in_the_jungle:9 "Rumble In The Jungle"
 ttm_rumble_in_the_jungle_desc:9 "The corrupted G.E.C.K. has massively upset the ecological balance of The Nursery. If we are to restore order, we must make a choice, and do it fast. Shall we preserve the legacy of the old world, or take on the opportunity that Reese has given us?"
 ttm_old_world_wildlife:9 "Old World Wildlife"
 ttm_old_world_wildlife_desc:9 "We must never forget our original purpose, and the heritage of the old world. We shall destroy every trace of Reese's vile experimentation, and restore balance to The Nursery by helping the existing pre-war wildlife that has been there since time immemorial."
 ttm_new_world_fauna:9 "New World Fauna"
 ttm_new_world_fauna_desc:9 "Adapting to the new world and potential wasteland was always the prime directive of The Nursery since its idea was first dreamt up. We will move old-world fauna into more appropriate and contained areas, then direct our focus toward studying the wildlife the corrupted G.E.C.K. has created."
 ttm_avian_preservation:9 "Avian Preservation"
 ttm_avian_preservation_desc:9 "Particular care must be taken in preserving the fragile avian ecosystem of the nursery, threatened by the aggressive new flora created by the corruption. Cleansing any traces of it inside The Nursery should be enough to ensure their survival, and set us back on our path of study into their physiology."
 ttm_simian_preservation:9 "Simian Preservation"
 ttm_simian_preservation_desc:9 "The hideous fauna created by Reese's creation kit threatens even the simian preservation section of The Nursery to an extent we cannot tolerate. Our robotic divisions will relentlessly hunt down and incinerate any traces that those biological abominations ever existed, then resettle said simian into their habitats for study once again."
 ttm_strength_of_the_wild:9 "Strength of the Wild"
 ttm_strength_of_the_wild_desc:9 "Our continuous analysis of pre-war DNA sequences and its possible applications in genetical manipulations have led us to an extremely interesting breakthrough. It seems like the sequence of the common wasteland dog is close enough to the pre-war tiger to allow splicing! If done, this would make them considerably more effective in combat."
 ttm_new_world_fauna:9 "New World Fauna"
 ttm_new_world_fauna_desc:9 "Adapting to the new world and potential wasteland was always the prime directive of The Nursery since its idea was first dreamt up.

 ttm_dionaea_muscipula:9 "Dionaea Muscipula"
 ttm_dionaea_muscipula_desc:9 "Dionaea Muscipula, most commonly known as the Venus fly-trap or the 'spore plant', is the result of Reese's insanity, and have mutated into an hyper-aggressive as well as gigantic state. Their genetical sequence is interesting, as it shows heightened levels of poison and radiation resistance. This could certainly be useful for our agricultural research."
 ttm_victims_of_the_geck:9 "Victims of the G.E.C.K."
 ttm_victims_of_the_geck_desc:9 "Poor humans present when the corrupted G.E.C.K. was unleashed have been twisted into horrendous abominations, half-human and half-plant. We must take care of the least affected, and contain all that we can. Studying the changes induced in their physiology could potentially produce a cure, and help advance our medical studies considerably."
 ttm_strength_of_the_spores:9 "Strength Of The Spores"
 ttm_strength_of_the_spores_desc:9 "With the decoding of both wasteland flora and the corrupted strands originating from the G.E.C.K., we have managed to fully sequence the mutation the latter has inflicted upon biological elements. We could use this to our advantage and expose plants in a controlled environment for military use, providing support in marshes or jungles where they would thrive."
 ttm_advanced_cloning_research:9 "Advanced Cloning Research"
 ttm_advanced_cloning_research_desc:9 "The sample of Jurassic biological material we have acquired has been absolutely fascinating to analyse! With our current technology we could be able to even integrate dinosaur genetical strands into our soldier, vastly improving their resilience in combat, and potentially proving them to be the pinnacle of our aspirations!"
 ttm_memory_management:9 "Memory Management"
 ttm_memory_management_desc:9 "As Diana's computational power has increased, she has been able to rearrange and organize her memory more efficiently as time went on.

Bringing it back online is essential to our efforts, and would let us even terraform the waste into its pre-war state with enough time!"
 ttm_a_paintbrush_for_the_wastes:9 "A Paintbrush For The Wastes"
 ttm_a_paintbrush_for_the_wastes_desc:9 "Sadly, it seems that the G.E.C.K. manufacturing line has fallen into a state of disrepair. Some of its capabilities such as the adaptational enhancement matrix could, however, be brought back online in each device with proper care. But unfortunately, the damage has been done, and its exact function would become... utterly random."
 ttm_refractoring_radiation_compression_device:9 "Refractoring Radiation Compression Device"
 ttm_refractoring_radiation_compression_device_desc:9 "Our knowledge of genetic engineering allows us to, with some effort, reactivates the R.R.C.D. sub-routine of the Creation Kit. A powerful genetic scanner, it automatically tracks corrupted DNA strands in fauna and flora, then purges said corruption and restores their original sequences. Its algorithm is extremely powerful, and could be put to good use."
 ttm_mass_relay_grassland_expander:9 "Mass Relay Grassland Extender"
 ttm_mass_relay_grassland_expander_desc:9 "Our existing agricultural research could allow us to reactivate the M.R.G.E. sub-routine of the Creation Kit. Its intended use was to supplement existing food production facilities with grassland prioritization during terraforming procedures. If we are lucky, it will activate and make the region more efficient in its food use, increasing water reserve as a byproduct."
 ttm_industrial_hillside_reforesting_network:9 "Industrial Hillside Reforesting Network"
 ttm_industrial_hillside_reforesting_network_desc:9 "The I.H.R.N. procedure is a general mass seeding program, possibly reactivated by our study of wasteland flora to calibrate it with. Intended for use in the centre of a nuclear blast to quickly terraform the centre of the blast, it makes heavy use of efficient power generation to fuel its operations, which we could recuperate after use for our own purposes."
 ttm_geologic_crystal_growth_prism:9 "Geologic Crystal Growth Prism"
 ttm_geologic_crystal_growth_prism_desc:9 "Applying our existing research into automated gathering systems could reactivate the G.C.G.P.'s sub-routine, pertaining to the creation of mineral deposits for resource-starved territories. While the activation would be random, it would still create additional deposits for us to mine, and increase our output of alloy in consequences."
 ttm_exponential_humidity_amplifier_system:9 "Exponential Humidity Amplifier System"
 ttm_exponential_humidity_amplifier_system_desc:9 "The E.H.A.S. terraforming package was integrated into the Creation Kit to help desert-like ecosystem recover from radiation waves. Its activation can be done with some efforts by using our wasteland soil study, and the infrastructure used to amplify humidity made to be rendered permanent, able to be scrapped once its purpose has been served."
 ttm_powering_production:9 "Powering Production"
 ttm_powering_production_desc:9 "Little by little, The Factory comes out of its slumber. Auxiliary generators come back online and manufacturing lines roar to life once again. It will take a lot more than what is currently powered to truly take advantage of this pre-war automated wonder, and we should study possible solutions to this post-haste."
 ttm_power_of_the_earth:9 "Power of the Earth"
 ttm_power_of_the_earth_desc:9 "Geothermal energy, tidal waves, underground generators, energy is already there just waiting to be harnessed. But first and foremost, we must study new ways to properly build said infrastructure without disturbing the ambient environment. Once done, the elements of the earth itself shall power The Factory."
 ttm_power_of_the_atom:9 "Power of the Atom"
 ttm_power_of_the_atom_desc:9 "A simple solution would be to bring back online the integrated nuclear generators inside The Factory. But to do so would be... problematic to say the least. Should we really try to harness once again what brought humanity's end so many years ago? The benefits are enormous, but it would take considerable efforts, and the Twin Mothers tribe would surely disapprove"
 ttm_power_of_the_wind:9 "Power of the Wind"
 ttm_power_of_the_wind_desc:9 "Further study into wind-based power options could not only give a natural alternative to the many industrial generators barely keeping The Factory on, but would also make it much easier to design aerial design from our multiple aerodynamic studies. Shall we try to harness the power of the wind?"
 ttm_harnessing_heat:9 "Harnessing Heat"
 ttm_harnessing_heat_desc:9 "Geothermal sources can be found throughout the blasted hellhole that is the wasteland, and even within our own territory many areas have been designated as hazard zone because of the scorching heat. Installing geothermal generators over those areas could power The Factory further, and bring back some of its many additional functions."
 ttm_rising_waters:9 "Rising Waters"
 ttm_rising_waters_desc:9 "The power of steam might be the answer to our problem. By harnessing the tides of the Rio Grande river, and using steam generators placed alongside the coast, we could further power The Factory while still having only minimal disruption in the local fauna."
 ttm_natural_power_generation:9 "Natural Power Generation"
 ttm_natural_power_generation_desc:9 "The wind is a natural resource easily harnessed to produce energy, but it is inefficient, and as such we would need to gain considerable territory to be able to have a decent yield. Once it would be settled, we could construct massive frictionless wind farms to power The Factory, and bring back its mighty industrial capacity to life."
 ttm_renewable_energy_doctrine:9 "Renewable Energy Doctrine"
 ttm_renewable_energy_doctrine_desc:9 "Our already existing study into efficient energy cell recycling could be applied to existing infrastructure inside The Factory, improving its auxiliary generators into an hyper-efficient state closing in to the level of a breeder reactor.
