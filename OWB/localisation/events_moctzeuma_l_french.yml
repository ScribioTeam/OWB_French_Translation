  nf_moc.1.d: "All the earth is a grave and nothign escapes it, \nNothing is so perfect that it does not descend to its tome.\nRivers, rivulets,fountains, and waters flow,\nbut never return to their joyful beginnings. \nAs they hasten on the vast realms of the rain god, \nThey also fashion the sad urn of their burial."

  nf_moc.2.d: "He who acts on high, \nfollows his own path. \nOh marvellous dweller among the clouds, \nOh dweller in the region of the frozen wings.\nHe causes the walls of fire to fall down, \nWhere the feathers are gathered.\nEager for war, the Flaming One descends. \nHe rages where the whirling dust arises."

  nf_moc.2.b: "There is war, there is burning."

  nf_moc.7.d: "Moctezuma's army has come and gone. The borderlands are in ruins - plumes of smoke dot the skyline. The attack has been truly devastating to the area, and it will take some time to recover from the attack."

  nc_moc.12.t: "Defeat in the Flower War"
  nf_moc.12.d: "Bad news from the front - the border clash is over, and our troops have been forced to retreat from the border. Moctezuma overran our border villages and settlements, destroying large swathes of land and infrastructure. Our troops have retreated to more defensible positions further back from the border, but we doubt the AI will engage in a prolonged campaign. Instead we shall have to wait for them to retreat, lick our wounds and attempt to rebuild. We shall be more ready for them next time."
