 MOJ_the_wastelands_last_great_mind:9 "The Wasteland's Last Great Mind"
 MOJ_the_wastelands_last_great_mind_desc:9 "Why am I even talking to you? I have more important things to be doing then explaining my plans to an imbecile."
 MOJ_journey_to_the_mojave:9 "Journey to the Mojave"
 MOJ_journey_to_the_mojave_desc:9 "The Elders at Lost Hills probably thought that this assignment was my banishment, a way to keep me from "corrupting" their ideals.\nLittle did they know that this is what, in the end, I have always wanted."
 MOJ_children_playing_with_bombs:9 "Like "Children Playing With Bombs""
 MOJ_children_playing_with_bombs_desc:9 "It would have been a perfect assignment, a playground of pre-war wonders for me to plunder and claim for my own ends.\nThere is only one thing keeping me from what I deserve, and its name is "NCR"."
 moj_power_armor_blueprints:9 "Power Armour Blueprints"
 moj_power_armor_blueprints_desc:9 "When I arrived here from Lost Hills my detachment was hardly equipped to deal with the threats we would face - I imagine not even Lost Hills would have predicted that the NCR would have arrived before us.\nI need to see if I can write up some improvements to the old power armor blueprints, find ways to make more use of the stock we brought over."
 moj_prep_optimising_helios_one:9 "Optimising HELIOS One"
 moj_prep_optimising_helios_one_desc:9 "I may have lost the Dam to the NCR, but at least I have HELIOS. Maybe I can spend some time with the systems of HELIOS to improve its output.."
 moj_prep_realign_the_panels:9 "Realign Solar Panels"
 moj_prep_realign_the_panels_desc:9 "While Poseidon engineers were able to account for much they didn't seem capable of accounting for the slight shifts to Earth's orbital axis that would occur after the Great War.\nIdiots.\nI can update the alignment program and shift it to match Earth's new orbit, should improve the output by at least two decimal points."
 moj_prep_improving_the_codebase:9 "Fixing Centuries Old Bugs"
 moj_prep_improving_the_codebase_desc:9 "They forgot a bracket."
 moj_prep_raw_poseidon_energy:9 "Raw Poseidon Energy"
 moj_prep_raw_poseidon_energy_desc:9 "HELIOS One will be the heart of the Brotherhood, energy beating from its veins and giving me the strength to do what lesser minds may find impossible."
 moj_prep_overlock_hidden_valley_generators:9 "Overclock Hidden Valley Generators"
 moj_prep_overlock_hidden_valley_generators_desc:9 "I don't have time to be doing that renovation work, for the purposes of energy core recharging we can just use the energy stockpiles located at Hidden Valley."
 moj_prep_work_with_the_gun_runners:9 "Work With the Gun Runners"
 moj_prep_work_with_the_gun_runners_desc:9 "I respect the Gun Runners more than the rest of the children merrily dancing around post apocalyptia. Rather then just acting as scavengers shifting through the garbage they actually take the effort to make their own weapons.\nIt's something that Lost Hills would never do but I could cut a deal with them to allow them to act as our arms supplier."
 moj_prep_refurbish_our_stockpile:9 "Refurbish Derelict Stockpile"
 moj_prep_refurbish_our_stockpile_desc:9 "Only one in ten suits of power armor have working pilot lights.\nOnly one in twenty of our microfusion cells come in full charge.\nOnly one in fifty of our power armour servos are to code.\nObviously this is a problem!"
 moj_prep_microfusion_cell_replacement:9 "Microfusion Cell Refurbishing"
 moj_prep_microfusion_cell_replacement_desc:9 "Turns out that most of our MF-Cells aren't even real MF, just energy shells re-fitted to fit to Plasma Rifle chambers. This is ridiculous - was Lost Hills trying to get me killed?"
 moj_prep_heavy_duty_ballistic_barrels:9 "Heavy Duty Ballistic Barrels"
 moj_prep_heavy_duty_ballistic_barrels_desc:9 "A paladin approached me the other day, telling me that the barrel of their AVENGER Minigun literally melted off the weapons chassis after thirty seconds of sustained test fire.\nGuess that means I need to sign off on replacement work to have our entire weapon barrel stock replaced."
 moj_prep_walking_artillery:9 "Walking Artillery"
 moj_prep_walking_artillery_desc:9 "Paladins are essentially walking artillery, capable of both taking and dealing sustained fighter in a way unalike a regular soldier. It is why the Brotherhood has been able to prosper where others have failed."
 moj_simulation_training:9 "Simulation Training"
 moj_simulation_training_desc:9 "I always hated VR Training, sitting in a chair while a computer gives you delusions is no way to learn how the world really works, how it ticks and bends to your actions at the slightest touch. Still, some of our expedition is so inexperienced that a few rounds in a simulation ring might get them better ready for war."
 MOJ_preparing_for_sunburst:9 "Testing the Bear"
 MOJ_preparing_for_sunburst_desc:9 "The NCR swarms like ants over Old World relics, its only a matter of time before they come after HELIOS to try to take what is mine.\nI need to break the NCR before they have that chance, and for that I need a plan."
 MOJ_mysteries_of_helios:9 "That Lucky Old Sun"
 MOJ_mysteries_of_helios_desc:9 "Hardin, McNamara and even Veronica find it foolish how much time I would invest into HELIOS One. Where they and I are different is that I can see what lies behind my sight. Out there, in orbit above the Earth is a weapon that can win the battle entirely if I was to bring it under my control.\nThat weapon is ARCHIMEDES, and I will prove that it really exists."
 moj_poseidon_relic_circuitry:9 "Poseidon Relic Circuitry"
 moj_poseidon_relic_circuitry_desc:9 "In order to get ARCHIMEDES operational I will need to find new circuit boards to replace those in the transmission equipment that have rotted away over the years. Wont be too hard to ask Brotherhood scouts to try to find this for me."
 moj_assigning_power:9 "Assigning Power"
 moj_assigning_power_desc:9 "ARCHIMEDES is an orbital weapon array that takes power from HELIOS, then uses it and sends it back to Earth in the form of a fiery, destructive beam. In order to do so I will need to ensure that power is properly being redirected to ARCHIMEDES."
 moj_petro_chico_military_encryption:9 "Petro Chico Military Encryption"
 moj_petro_chico_military_encryption_desc:9 "It seems that Poseidon brought on a few Petro Chico employees to work on ARCHIMEDES. It's strange, the encryption technology seeming to change and fight back against me as I try to break it - as if it had a personality of its own?\nNo matter, will be relatively simple to make it kneel with a few more tries..."
 MOJ_spears_from_the_sun:9 "Spears from the Sun"
 MOJ_spears_from_the_sun_desc:9 "A bit of bargaining has finally allowed one of my scouts to attain the last piece needed for activation of the ARCHIMEDES station, the "Euclid's C-Finder" as it is known is a trigger mechanism to allow ARCHIMEDES to attain a firing position.\nWould have been easier if they just let you code in the firing position manually - but I can't complain with these results."
 MOJ_open_hostility:9 "Tend to Your Business"
 MOJ_open_hostility_desc:9 "Hardin, my head Paladin is advising that I save the ARCHIMEDES project for later. Instead? He thinks that a surprise offensive will stall the NCR and give us the push we need to drive them out of the Mojave for good. Perhaps I should listen to him?"
 moj_caravan_raids:9 "Caravan Raids"
 moj_caravan_raids_desc:9 "The NCR relies on long caravans coming from the Long 15 to supply its forces. Hardin recommends to strike at the NCR early here so we might be able to gain an early advantage.\nIt will be a bloody fight - after all, the caravanners heading up through the Long 15 are often simple couriers and small Brahmin convoys."
 moj_searchlight_strike_force:9 "Searchlight Strike Force"
 moj_searchlight_strike_force_desc:9 "Camp Searchlight will be the main supply depot the NCR uses to push from the south. By striking at the NCR here we can ensure that they will be bleeding even before the battle starts."
 moj_van_graff_supply_runs:9 "Van Graff Supply Runs"
 moj_van_graff_supply_runs_desc:9 "The Van Graffs, if they were to side with the NCR put us at risk. Lets remove them from the picture and hurt their bottom line."
 moj_death_and_glory:9 "Death and Glory"
 moj_death_and_glory_desc:9 "Hardin and I have built a small "friendship" during the period of these raids. When he isn't here arguing with me and instead out there killing my enemies he can be a useful tool."
 moj_accept_veronicas_help:9 "I Could Make You Care"
 moj_accept_veronicas_help_desc:9 "Veronica was always the person I was closest to. Its why I had her come with me to the Mojave - I had to show her what could be accomplished if you know how to put the Old World to use in the right ways.\nNow though? She has a.. strange plane she has brought to my attention, she feels that if I was to get the denizens of the Mojave on my side, victory against the NCR would be assured."
 moj_ally_with_tabitha:9 "Using the Super Mutants"
 moj_ally_with_tabitha_desc:9 "Near Black Mountain lives a group of Super Mutants that are particularly.. strange. They are led by one calling themselves "Tabitha", a super mutant who uses radio broadcasts to tell other mutants of her nation of "Utobitha". According to Veronica could be easily swayed to our side if we were to simply jam their broadcasts, then tell them that its the NCR that is keeping their broadcasts from playing."
 moj_work_with_the_bright:9 "Work with the Bright"
 moj_work_with_the_bright_desc:9 "The "Brotherhood of the Bright" as it is known is a collection of ghouls that believe in space there is a home out there that would be the perfect home for them. By using a REPCONN rocket they hope to travel there - they just need assistance. Veronica says that if we were to promise to help them get their rocket operational they would be willing to help us fight the NCR."
 moj_sway_the_star_chasers:9 "Sway the Star Chasers"
 moj_sway_the_star_chasers_desc:9 "Out there in the wasteland are a group known as "Star Chasers". unorganized, but experienced wastelanders trying to find Sunset Sarsaparilla Star Bottlecaps and an Old World treasure connected to them.\nVeronica has a plan in mind. If we were to simply spread the rumour that the NCR is here to hunt the caps they would join our side!"
 moj_support_of_the_mojave:9 "Paladins of the Mojave"
 moj_support_of_the_mojave_desc:9 "Veronica has been taking my advice to heart, it seems - but in her own way. She understands that people can be pushed and used to accomplish your goals if you merely give them a little incentive, yet still wishes to try for results that lead to every ones betterment, rather then just herself.\nShe still has some ways to go, but I like her progress so far."
 moj_emergency_ammunition:9 "Emergency Ammunition"
 moj_emergency_ammunition_desc:9 "Quickly! We need to find as much ammunition as we can!"
 moj_emergency_production:9 "Emergency Production"
 moj_emergency_production_desc:9 "Work harder! Work harder!"
 moj_emergency_materials:9 "Emergency Materials"
 moj_emergency_materials_desc:9 "Running out of tech to throw at the NCR, we need to find more!"
 moj_emergency_recruitment:9 "Emergency Recruitment"
 moj_emergency_recruitment_desc:9 "Time to begin recruiting the Scribes! Everyone needs to help fight the NCR!"
 moj_the_mojave_secured:9 "Victory At Sunburst"
 moj_the_mojave_secured_desc:9 "To others, this victory may have been seen as the impossible.\nThey were fools. My victory here was always a certainty."
 moj_helios_citadel:9 "Establish Helios Citadel"
 moj_helios_citadel_desc:9 "With our Chapter no longer having to hide at Helios its time I guide the Brotherhood and show them where to establish their new base of operations.\nHelios might not have been a defensible location before - but I will make it into the Citadel it was always meant to be and prove them wrong. The Brotherhood will base their operations here!"
 moj_neck_of_the_colorado:9 "Neck of the Colorado"
 moj_neck_of_the_colorado_desc:9 "With our Chapter no longer having to hide at Helios its time I guide the Brotherhood and show them where to establish their new base of operations.\nThe Hoover Dam was always what I wanted out of the Mojave and its what I will get. The Brotherhood will base their operations there!"
 moj_fortify_hidden_valley:9 "Fortify Hidden Valley"
 moj_fortify_hidden_valley_desc:9 "With our Chapter no longer having to hide at Helios its time I guide the Brotherhood and show them where to establish their new base of operations.\nI can't have the Brotherhood advertising its victory - we will move to Hidden Valley and rebuild, fortify and prepare to ensure our victory is a long one."
 moj_integrating_the_mojave:9 "Integrating the Mojave"
 moj_integrating_the_mojave_desc:9 "Now that we have conquered the Mojave I need to ensure that the NCR can't simply come back here. I need to make it "mine"."
 moj_expand_the_188:9 "Expand the '188"
 moj_expand_the_188_desc:9 "The '188 Trade Station has always been Veronica's little hotspot for gossip and trading with wastelanders before the victory at sunburst. It may prove useful to expand our presence there."
 moj_controlling_nipton_through_fear:9 "Controlling Nipton Through Fear"
 moj_controlling_nipton_through_fear_desc:9 "Joseph Steyn, the mayor of Nipton is a tool unalike any other. The moment we beat the NCR he submitted to us and acknowledged Brotherhood leadership over Nipton - likely as a means by which he could ensure his own life.\nSmart."
 moj_offer_power_for_compliance:9 "Offer Power for Compliance"
 moj_offer_power_for_compliance_desc:9 "The Brotherhood's rule over the Mojave will be a simple one - they will turn over scientific and notable material and offer food and labour services when asked. In return? We will direct power from HELIOS to the hardest working and most loyal of townships, granting them luxury in exchange for their obedience."
 moj_mandatory_service_for_all:9 "Mandatory Service for All"
 moj_mandatory_service_for_all_desc:9 "I am not a monster.\nWe will simply require that all denizens of the southern Mojave move from their homes, travel to [MOJ.Capital.GetName] and attempt to go through a rigorous test to join as a initiate. Finding as many suitable initiates as possible needs to be my priority in the Mojave."

 moj_rend_the_mojave_dry:9 "Rendre le Mojave sec"
 moj_rend_the_mojave_dry_desc:9 "La technologie ne peut plus rester entre les mains des habitants des Terres Désolées. Tout ce qui pourrait être une menace doit être considéré comme une menace. Il ne suffit pas de suivre les observations de technologie des Terres Désolées, il est temps de les rechercher de manière proactive. Défoncez toutes les portes, ouvrez tous les placards. Nous n'arrêterons pas de chercher tant que la maison ne sera pas vide, ou tant que les occupants ne seront pas morts : ou les deux."

 moj_post_sunburst_helios_research:9 "Post-Sunburst Helios Research"
 moj_post_sunburst_helios_research_desc:9 "Now that I don't have to worry about the bear breathing down my neck I can give HELIOS the time it needs."

 moj_to_the_great_beyond:9 "To the Great Beyond"
 moj_to_the_great_beyond_desc:9 "Veronica, for some reason is insisting that I actually go through and try to help these groups with the Brotherhood's resources. While a purely humanitarian effort would be a waste of my time no reason I can't find some useful information in the interim. The Ghouls travelling to the "Great Beyond" actually have a fair knowledge of REPCONN rocket systems. Perhaps they can share that information when we help them?"
 moj_hunt_the_stars_for_the_seekers:9 "Hunt the Stars for the Seekers"
 moj_hunt_the_stars_for_the_seekers_desc:9 "Admittedly, the devotion that these star seekers have to finding Festus's treasure is impressive. Lets send a few scouts out and follow them, see if any of them ever actually uncover something of importance for the Brotherhood."
 moj_black_mountain_radio_broadcasts:9 "The Black Mountain Trap"
 moj_black_mountain_radio_broadcasts_desc:9 "Surprisingly, keeping Utobitha around and allowing them to continue their broadcasts is very useful. It effectively acts as a "lure", bringing Super Mutants out of hiding and into our territory - from there allowing us to gun them down and keep their numbers low."
 moj_elijahs_ambitions:9 "Elijah's Ambition"
 moj_elijahs_ambitions_desc:9 "This is my moment! My chance to gain what I have always deserved."
 moj_houses_schematics:9 "Houses Schematics"
 moj_houses_schematics_desc:9 "The Lucky 38 is a treasure trove. Now? It is "my" treasure trove.\nI'll send in a few paladins to rip apart the casino, find out what made House's industry tick. I would love to figure out what made his life sustaining technology work..."
 moj_jewel_of_the_mojave:9 "Jewel of the Mojave"
 moj_jewel_of_the_mojave_desc:9 "Its a wonder that House has lived as long as he did. I am not a superstitious man - but he got lucky.\nIts time my soldiers take a vacation to Vegas, enjoy the night life of the city of sin before they bring in a management shift.\nNo monopoly rules forever, after all."
 moj_work_with_benny:9 "Work With Benny"
 moj_work_with_benny_desc:9 "Benny, the leader of the Tops has made it a point to approach us and offer his aid. Its clear that Benny is the type of man to respect power, aligning himself with whoever he thinks is the best bet to win.\nHe has bet well this time, at least."
 moj_scavenge_vault_21:9 "Scavenge Vault 21"
 moj_scavenge_vault_21_desc:9 "Vault 21 has been - regretfully - mostly filled in by this point. A empty hole in the ground lined with Vault-Tec steel. After my scouts tear it down it will just be a hole in the ground, won't even recognise it as a vault anymore."
 moj_steward_of_vegas:9 "Steward of Vegas"
 moj_steward_of_vegas_desc:9 "In truth? I never wanted to deal with Vegas on my own. It was too much work - more interested in the technological relics there then the reformed tribals and hopeless gamblers. Benny has offered a solution! Before, he was plotting to take over Vegas with the aid of a specialized AI uploaded to the Lucky 38 to replace House.\nI like this "Yes Man" already.."
 moj_enlist_the_families:9 "Enlist the Families"
 moj_enlist_the_families_desc:9 "In truth? I never wanted to deal with Vegas on my own. It was too much work - more interested in the technological relics there then the reformed tribals and hopeless gamblers. No reason to break something that was working - we can simply have the reformed tribals that were there submit to us and grant us tribute in return for us mostly leaving them alone."
 moj_houses_ultimate_treasure:9 "Houses Ultimate Treasure"
 moj_houses_ultimate_treasure_desc:9 "My policy toward ruling Vegas - of benign dictatorship has really paid off. A member of the Tops has given us a rather.. particular little thing. They say its the "Platinum Chip", a little piece of technology that is the key to upgrading Securitron AI. While we don't use House's Securitrons outside of the Strip we can take advantage of the knowledge in this marvellous little chip."

 moj_preparing_against_the_legion:9 "Preparing Against the Legion"
 moj_preparing_against_the_legion_desc:9 "Idiots! Idiots all of them!\nThese paladins can't even fight faux classical age soldiers. They have a two thousand year technological and tactical advantage over them! This shouldn't be happening! Everyone needs to prepare for the Legion, we can't be made fools of again!"
 moj_reserve_power_in_archimedes:9 "Reserve Power in ARCHIMEDES"
 moj_reserve_power_in_archimedes_desc:9 "If I am going to defeat the Legion I need to ensure that the ARCHIMEDES satellite is fully operational. Should be trivial to store a small pocket of backup power in HELIOS for the day the Legion arrives."
 moj_rescue_legion_slaves:9 "Rescue Legion Slaves"
 moj_rescue_legion_slaves_desc:9 "Slavery is a efficient system if used right - yet often it is used by true idiots who can't do the work themselves.\nLets steal the Legion's slaves, bring them to the Mojave and deprive the Legion of the workers they rely so."
 moj_fortifying_the_dam:9 "Fortifying the Dam"
 moj_fortifying_the_dam_desc:9 "The Dam is a heavily defensible location. I'll have McNamara fortify it for me and manage the defences against the Legion proper."
 moj_smelt_down_legion_currency:9 "Smelt Down Legion Currency"
 moj_smelt_down_legion_currency_desc:9 "The Legion's currency is gold, a rare medal in the Old World. Lets smelt it down and use it as replacement circuitry wires."
 moj_reward_veterans_of_the_legion_campaign:9 "Rewarding Veterans of the Legion Campaign"
 moj_reward_veterans_of_the_legion_campaign_desc:9 "While I don't normally hand out baubles for a job well done this campaign was a difficult one. I will ensure - at least - that the hardest working of those soldiers who battled in this campaign are aware of their contribution."
 moj_soldiers_of_helios:9 "Soldiers of Helios"
 moj_soldiers_of_helios_desc:9 "The Soldiers of Helios is the name given to the battalions that fought and served in both Operation Sunburst and the First Battle of the Hoover Dam. A little propaganda never hurt to inspire the troops and weaken the enemy, even if I was never one for such things."

 moj_repconn_development:9 "REPCONN Development"
 moj_repconn_development_desc:9 "Rocketry technology is something that is so hard to test in practice - its reliance on the infrastructure of the United States bringing in fuel, metal and scientists something that is entirely not possible in the Wasteland. Still, I am lucky to have found this site. By studying the rockets in this place - and the mistakes they have made - I can build something even better then what was available back then."
 moj_study_primm_slimm:9 "Study Primm Slim"
 moj_study_primm_slimm_desc:9 "In the town of Primm there is a rather strange Old World robot by the name of "Primm Slim". Robots that have had personalities installed and been active this long always have useful little bits of knowledge. Lets have that robot go on a field trip across the Mojave - I might learn something from its old memory banks."
 moj_follow_the_navarro_survivors:9 "A la poursuite de la \"Brigade du Diable\""
 moj_follow_the_navarro_survivors_desc:9 "Hardin has heard rumours that a Navarro Remnants cell exists somewhere in the Mojave. Lets have them build a task force to try to locate and eliminate these enemies to the Brotherhood."
 moj_the_cipher_expedition:9 "The Cipher Expedition"
 moj_the_cipher_expedition_desc:9 "My top choice of expedition target was always to come here, to the Mojave.\nMy second choice? Definitely the Ciphers. The Ciphers of the West have been mythologised as great protectors of technology! I think sending a few scouts out east will serve well to learn more of this group."

 MOJ_little_yangzte:9 "Little Yangtze"

 moj_saturnite_research_facility_desc:9 "I don't think its really from Saturn."

 moj_study_our_enemies:9 "Study Our Enemies"
 moj_study_our_enemies_desc:9 "It seems that this mysterious cloud that hovers over the Sierra Madre not only makes it hard to breath - but also has infected a few Old World workers, corrupting their bodies and driving them mad. I will need to study these enemies if I am to give my paladins something to fight them."
 moj_study_the_cloud:9 "Study the Cloud"
 moj_study_the_cloud_desc:9 "The "Cloud", as local denizens call it is a destructive chemical miasma that coats the entirety of the Sierra Madre, sealing it and keeping it safe from the wretched of the new world. I will have to study it if I am to discover the secrets of the Sierra Madre."
 moj_design_cloud_walker_power_armor:9 "Cloud Walker Power Armour"
 moj_design_cloud_walker_power_armor_desc:9 "It turns out that the filtration units on the suits of those beasts living near the Sierra Madre was never working correctly, working to seal the Cloud in their suits more then give them safety from it. In order for our paladins to strike into the Sierra Madre they will need new filtration suits on their Power Armour... At the same time I could also include a few upgrades here and there."
 moj_brotherhood_teams:9 "Brotherhood Scouting Teams"
 moj_brotherhood_teams_desc:9 "The Gala Event is the way in which we will open the Sierra Madre, and for it I need different people at different places acting in unison - like a machine\nA more central, focused Brotherhood offensive will be what we need to trigger the Gala event. I can't trust Wastelanders to do a task this important."
 moj_wastelander_teams:9 "Wastelander Scouting Teams"
 moj_wastelander_teams_desc:9 "The Gala Event is the way in which we will open the Sierra Madre, and for it I need different people at different places acting in unison - like a machine\nThe fact that this treasure is so tempting is exactly "why" I need to use outsiders of the Brotherhood. I can't risk the Brotherhood turning on me - not when I am this close."
 moj_a_chained_dog:9 "A Chained Dog"
 moj_a_chained_dog_desc:9 "Sometimes a leash and a collar is all you need to get what you want out of someone."

 moj_design_the_holorifle:9 "Design the Holorifle"
 moj_design_the_holorifle_desc:9 "The Holograms at the Sierra Madre posses strange weapons based technology. Perhaps there is a way I can put it to use?"
 moj_harness_the_cloud:9 "The Cloud"
 moj_harness_the_cloud_desc:9 "I could always kill everyone with this, leave the world empty and quiet... No, I am not a monster. I can't do that to Veronica. I will design a way to use this that wont involve Armageddon."

 MOJ_our_founding_desc:0 "Alors que le grand sage Maxson était le fondateur de la Confrérie dans son ensemble, chaque chapitre a eu ses propres fondateurs, ceux qui ont fait connaître les dangers de la technologie plus loin dans les Terres Désolées. Qui étaient nos fondateurs ?"

 moj_needs_to_be_secured:9 "§RCette région individuelle doit être sécurisée avant que nous puissions nous concentrer sur ce point.§!"
 MOJ_our_interim:0 "Notre objectif"
 MOJ_our_interim_desc:0 "Chaque chapitre de la Confrérie a ses propres priorités. Certains se concentrent sur la collecte des armes puissantes du Vieux Monde, tandis que d'autres donnent la priorité aux machines et outils industriels. Sur quoi nous sommes-nous concentrés ?"

 MOJ_our_future:0 "Notre futur"
 MOJ_our_future_desc:0 "Nous avons beaucoup appris au cours des années qui sont maintenant derrière nous. Nous devons maintenant utiliser cette expérience et nous préparer pour les nombreuses années qui nous attendent."

 MOJ_water_operations:0 "Opérations navales"
 MOJ_water_operations_desc:0 "Avec un accès sécurisé à une grande étendue d'eau, nous pouvons commencer à étendre nos opérations à un théâtre naval. Bien que nous n'ayons que peu ou pas d'expérience dans ce domaine, nous pouvons compter sur les tactiques d'avant-guerre pour nous guider."

 MOJ_port_expansion:0 "Expansion du port"
 MOJ_port_expansion_desc:0 "Afin d'accueillir une flotte de taille opérationnelle, nous avons besoin de nombreuses installations, telles que des cales sèches, des chantiers d'entretien, des jetées, etc. Pour atteindre nos objectifs, nous devrons investir massivement dans l'expansion de notre infrastructure navale existante."

 MOJ_supporting_vessels:0 "Corsaires"
 MOJ_supporting_vessels_desc:0 "Les petites embarcations et les embarcations plus légères constituent l'essentiel des marines modernes des Terres Désolées. Pour garder notre avantage dans les mers, nous devons investir dans la production d'embarcations simples et robustes, qui peuvent facilement harceler les navires ennemis."

 MOJ_larger_vessels:0 "Navires de siège"
 MOJ_larger_vessels_desc:0 "Pour faire une brèche dans une marine ennemie et pour soutenir efficacement nos troupes à terre, nous devons être capables de construire de grands navires capables de monter des armes de grande taille. En nous concentrant sur ce point, nous nous rapprocherons de la domination navale."

 MOJ_reclaim_a_flagship:0 "Récupérer un navire amiral"
 MOJ_reclaim_a_flagship_desc:9 "La projection de la force est primordiale. Pour vraiment faire notre marque sur les mers, nous ne pouvons pas simplement avoir une marine efficace : nous devons aussi avoir une marine impressionnante. Un vaisseau amiral réaménagé du Vieux Monde répondrait parfaitement à nos besoins."

 MOJ_aerial_operations:0 "Opérations aériennes"
 MOJ_aerial_operations_desc:0 "Notre organisation manque souvent de flexibilité. Pour rendre compte de nos faiblesses, nous devons les transformer en forces. Dans le passé, de vastes expéditions ont été entreprises à l'aide d'équipements aériens. Nous pouvons en tirer des leçons."

 MOJ_from_the_skies:0 "Depuis le ciel"
 MOJ_from_the_skies_desc:0 "Bien que nous possédons les connaissances nécessaires à la modernisation des avions les plus élémentaires, nous ne savons pas comment les piloter au combat, ni comment les utiliser sur un plan tactique. Nous devrions nous tourner vers nos bases de données et adapter autant d'informations sur les tactiques aériennes d'avant-guerre que possible."

 MOJ_staging_bases:0 "Bases de préparation"
 MOJ_staging_bases_desc:0 "Les avions sont des presse-papiers surdimensionnés sans les installations appropriées pour les entretenir et les armer, et suffisamment d'espace libre pour décoller et atterrir. Si nous voulons développer une force aérienne efficace, nous devons rechercher les endroits idéaux pour créer des aérodromes, et c'est exactement ce que nous faisons."

 MOJ_aerial_supremacy:0 "Suprématie aérienne"
 MOJ_aerial_supremacy_desc:0 "Grâce à notre nouvelle compréhension du combat aérien, nous pouvons commencer à redessiner nos avions en gardant à l'esprit le terrain vague. Réduire les coûts là où c'est possible nous permettra d'économiser beaucoup de temps de production et de précieuses ressources, deux choses qui sont actuellement rares."

 MOJ_flight_academy:0 "Académie de vol de la Confrérie"
 MOJ_flight_academy_desc:0 "Les pilotes sont l'élément vital d'une force aérienne, et nos pilotes doivent utiliser efficacement notre approvisionnement limité d'avions, de munitions et d'équipement. La mise en place d'un programme de formation approfondie pour les pilotes permettra non seulement de mieux utiliser nos équipements, mais aussi d'avoir un véritable atout."

 MOJ_our_right:0 "Notre droit"
 MOJ_our_right_desc:0 "En tant qu'organisation technocratique, chaque technologie est à juste titre la nôtre. Nous ne volons pas la technologie par malice ou par dépit, nous l'enlevons pour protéger les innocents qui l'utiliseront inévitablement à mauvais escient. Bien que les gens ne comprennent pas toujours, tout ce que nous faisons, en fin de compte, c'est pour assurer la sécurité des Terres Désolées. Notre compréhension de la technologie est inégalée."

 MOJ_salvaged_metal:0 "Métal revalorisé"
 MOJ_salvaged_metal_desc:9 "La récupération du métal est facile à effectuer. Les débris de métal torsadés sont aussi communs que la saleté dans les Terres Désolées, dépassant des bâtiments, enfouis dans la terre comme des mauvaises herbes, et éparpillés dans les rues comme des déchets. En récupérant le métal dans notre région immédiate, nous aurons plus de ressources pour notre équipement."

 MOJ_increase_power_production:0 "Augmenter la production d'énergie"
 MOJ_increase_power_production_desc:0 "Les générateurs sont à la fois une bénédiction et une malédiction. Ils créent de grandes quantités d'énergie pour un coût d'entretien relativement faible, mais ils nécessitent souvent des piles à combustible spécifiques et sont difficiles à repenser pour fonctionner avec du carburant de maïs. Investir dans la production d'électricité profitera toujours à nos équipements."

 MOJ_salvaged_electronics:0 "Produits électroniques récupéré"
 MOJ_salvaged_electronics_desc:0 "La récupération des produits électroniques est beaucoup plus difficile que la récupération du métal, en partie à cause de la nature délicate de la plupart des produits électroniques. Au mieux, tirer le câblage et les circuits des radios, des robots et des armes à énergie cassées nous fournira plus de rebuts électroniques pour les projets futurs."

 MOJ_advanced_tech:0 "Technologie de pointe"
 MOJ_advanced_tech_desc:0 "Rassembler des technologies rares n'est pas seulement difficile, mais dangereux. Souvent, les endroits où l'on peut trouver des technologies rares d'avant-guerre sont aussi remplis de robots tueurs, de radiations mortelles ou d'autres dangers. Néanmoins, la collecte de technologies avancées nous permettra de créer de nombreuses pièces d'équipement haut de gamme, ce qui donc doit être fait."

 MOJ_fueling_our_rise:0 "Alimenter notre ascension"
 MOJ_fueling_our_rise_desc:0 "Le combustible se présente sous toutes ses formes, mais il arrive souvent que nos équipes de récupération recherchent la variété nucléaire. Les piles à combustible non dépensées ont une valeur inestimable pour tout le monde dans le désert, mais surtout pour nous. Ils alimentent notre Armure Assistée, nos gatling laser et nos générateurs. Les sécuriser est une grande priorité pour tous les éclaireurs."

 MOJ_arm_foundries:0 "Fonderies d'armes"
 MOJ_arm_foundries_desc:0 "Nous ne pouvons pas répandre et maintenir notre doctrine sans force, et nous ne pouvons pas appliquer la force efficacement si nos hommes sont sous-approvisionnés. Si la Confrérie doit poursuivre ses activités, nous devons non seulement prendre la technologie des mains des colons, mais aussi la produire nous-mêmes."

 MOJ_civilian_workshops:0 "Ateliers civils"
 MOJ_civilian_workshops_desc:0 "Bon nombre des bunkers et des bases que nous cherchons à occuper n'ont pas été épargnés par la Grande Guerre, et ils nécessitent d'importants travaux de réparation et d'excavation pour devenir pleinement utilisables. Pour nous préparer aux futurs travaux de construction, nous devrions commencer à développer notre propre petite base industrielle."

 MOJ_heavy_production:0 "Production lourde"
 MOJ_heavy_production_desc:0 "Nos projets de l'industrie civile et militaire étant terminés, nous constatons que nos efforts portent leurs fruits. Afin de continuer à favoriser le succès et à alimenter notre croissance, nous devrions lancer un deuxième projet de construction de moindre envergure, en nous concentrant sur un mélange des deux succursales. Parallèlement, nous pouvons également mettre en place une infrastructure pour les efforts futurs."

 MOJ_our_might:0 "Notre puissance"
 MOJ_our_might_desc:0 "La Confrérie de l'acier est crainte et respectée dans tout le désert pour notre puissance militaire. En termes d'efficacité au combat, nous sommes bien au-dessus de la lie que les Terres Désolées ont à offrir. Un homme dans une armure puissante vaut dix soldats non équipés, sinon plus. L'étude des engagements antérieurs nous aidera à améliorer notre future doctrine de combat."

 MOJ_steel_legions:0 "Légions d'acier"
 MOJ_steel_legions_desc:0 "Debout côte à côte, nos hommes forment un mur d'une force incassable. La Confrérie est comme une longue chaîne, répartie sur tout le continent, avec beaucoup, beaucoup, beaucoup de maillons sur toute sa longueur. Aucune partie de la Confrérie n'est faible, chaque homme et chaque femme est formé à un niveau de compétence dont d'autres groupes ne peuvent que rêver."

 MOJ_new_initiates:0 "Nouveaux initiés"
 MOJ_new_initiates_desc:0 "Nous sommes plus qu'une organisation militaire, la Confrérie est une grande famille. Nos chevaliers, paladins et scribes sont tous libres de poursuivre des relations, de se marier et d'avoir des enfants. C'est ainsi que la Confrérie survit. Lorsque ces enfants atteignent l'âge adulte, ils deviennent des initiés et commencent leur formation dans leur discipline respective."

 MOJ_t45d_production:45 "Production de la T-45d"
 MOJ_t45d_production_desc:0 "T-45d a été le premier modèle d'armure assistée produit par les États-Unis, et ça se voit. Un cadre simple, des servomoteurs peu reluisants, des points faibles exposés et un design de casque moins séduisant. Néanmoins, toute armure assistée est mieux que rien, et sa simplicité la rend plus rapide à réparer et à produire."

 MOJ_t51b_production:0 "Production de la T-51b"
 MOJ_t51b_production_desc:0 "Le modèle T-51b, l'apogée de la conception des armures armures d'avant-guerre, est l'un des modèles préférés de la Confrérie de l'acier pour sa conception robuste, son armure en céramique façonnée, l'absence de points faibles clairs, et son casque et ses filtres fabriqués de façon spécialisée. Bien qu'elle soit plus difficile à entretenir et à produire, il ne fait aucun doute que la T-51b est supérieure à la T-45d à tous points de vue."

 MOJ_wastelander_conscripts:0 "Conscrits des Terres Désolées"
 MOJ_wastelander_conscripts_desc:0 "Les habitants des Terres se trouvent à la pelle, avec peu de particularité ou d'unicité à leur sujet. Souvent myope, brutal et trop simple pour comprendre le danger de la technologie : on les évite souvent comme la peste. Pourtant, parfois, on a besoin de sang neuf. Dans de tels moments, nous chassons la population pour trouver des candidats dignes de ce nom, en acceptant souvent dans nos rangs des gens qui ont fait leurs preuves et qui sont amicaux."

 MOJ_flesh_before_steel:0 "La chair avant l'acier"
 MOJ_flesh_before_steel_desc:0 "\"La chair est faible,\" une phrase commune avec une signification très différente pour les autres que pour nous. Dans la Confrérie, on dit que cette phrase exprime et accepte que le corps humain est fragile. Même avec notre armure assistée, nous sommes toujours humains, et à moins que le corps à l'intérieur de l'armure n'ait été entraîné correctement, il mourra bien avant que l'armure ne se brise. Tous les initiés sont formés pour comprendre ceci : la faiblesse est humaine."

 MOJ_basic_arms_for_basic_people:0 "Des armes simples pour des individus simples"
 MOJ_basic_arms_for_basic_people_desc:0 "Même les personnes des Terres Désolées recrutées dans nos rangs ne peuvent pas comprendre la technologie aussi bien que nous. Afin de prévenir tout accident malheureux, nous fournissons aux recrues des armes à énergie plus simples jusqu'à ce qu'elles aient fait leurs preuves. Naturellement, cela signifie que nous produisons et récupérons de nombreuses armes à l'avance pour les nouvelles recrus."

 MOJ_doctrinal_thought:0 "Pensée doctrinale"
 MOJ_doctrinal_thought_desc:0 "Avec le sang neuf vient de nouvelles idées. Les gens des Terres Désolées pensent et se battent d'une manière différente de la Confrérie, et cette expérience s'avère souvent précieuse pour la Confrérie dans son ensemble. En faisant rédiger par nos initiés des rapports sur leurs batailles précédentes, nous pouvons les examiner pour évaluer l'état des Terres Désolées et nous préparer en conséquence."

 MOJ_combined_operations:0 "Opérations conjointes"
 MOJ_combined_operations_desc:0 "Il peut être difficile d'apprendre à se battre aux côtés d'anciens soldats des Terres Désolées. Leur style de combat sauvage et survivaliste peut souvent être mouvementé et imprévisible. C'est précisément la raison pour laquelle leur recrutement peut être si précieux et pourquoi leur intégration dans notre structure de commandement est si bénéfique. Cette nature sauvage et imprévisible rend nos équipes plus efficaces qu'auparavant."

 MOJ_our_goal:0 "Notre but"
 MOJ_our_goal_desc:0 "L'idéologie de la Confrérie est directe. Nous désirons un monde dans lequel l'insouciance de l'homme ne peut être rendue possible par les outils qu'il utilise, un monde dans lequel les atrocités ne sont pas commises au nom du \"progrès scientifique\". C'est pourquoi nous confisquons la technologie et détruisons ce que nous ne pouvons pas confisquer. Tous nos devoirs sont pour le bien de l'humanité dans son ensemble."

 MOJ_seek_technology:0 "Étude technologique"
 MOJ_seek_technology_desc:0 "Reproduire l'électronique de l'avant-guerre est une tâche difficile, même pour les conceptions les plus simples. Si nous voulons avoir l'espoir de recréer de façon fiable des conceptions quelque peu avancées, nous devons disséquer nos précieux modèles d'avant-guerre et examiner leur fonctionnement intérieur. C'est douloureux, mais à moins de découvrir le secret derrière ces choses, nous serons toujours dans le noir."

 MOJ_scribe_research:0 "Recherche des scribes"
 MOJ_scribe_research_desc:0 "Pousser nos scribes vers des projets de recherche plus longs nous récompensera inévitablement. Donner la priorité à l'étude à long terme et à la réflexion personnelle devrait rendre nos résultats plus précis, et le fait que des scribes accompagnent les escadrons de scoutisme devrait les rendre beaucoup plus capables d'enquêter sur les sites d'avant-guerre. Les scribes sont la colonne vertébrale de la Confrérie, nous devons continuer à affiner leurs compétences."

 MOJ_old_developments:0 "Anciens développements"
 MOJ_old_developments_desc:0 "La technologie d'avant-guerre a une valeur intrinsèque, même si elle est cassée et que de la ferraille pure. Fouiller les ruines d'avant-guerre à la recherche de technologies rares non découvertes, qu'elles soient brisées ou quelque peu opérationnelles, est une partie importante des opérations de la Confrérie dans les Terres Désolées."

 MOJ_robotic_advancements:0 "Avancées robotiques"
 MOJ_robotic_advancements_desc:0 "La robotique était l'une des plus grandes industries américaines avant la Grande Guerre, et elle était considérée comme un leader mondial dans le domaine de la robotique. De ce fait, le terrain vague est parsemé les carcasses de robots cassés, ainsi que les chiffres d'itinérance de ceux qui suivent encore une programmation dépassée. Démonter les deux nous aidera à construire des robots pour nos propres fins."

 MOJ_vertibird_schematics:0 "Plan du vertiptère"
 MOJ_vertibird_schematics_desc:0 "Le plus prisé de tous les schémas d'avant-guerre, les schémas des vertiptères sont rares et difficiles à trouver. Toutes les copies connues ne sont jamais venues que de l'Enclave, et avec leur disparition, cette précieuse réserve s'est asséchée. Pourtant, les anciens techniciens de l'Enclave qui ont échappé à leur disparition emportent souvent beaucoup d'outils avec eux... et parfois, un schéma ou deux."

 MOJ_bunker_thought:0 "Mentalité de l'Abri"
 MOJ_bunker_thought_desc:0 "Presque tous les membres de la Confrérie sont nés dans un bunker, et la plupart d'entre nous avons passé notre vie à grandir dans et autour d'eux. Pour nous, la sécurité d'un abri est rassurante et réconfortante. Par conséquent, les fortifications de la Confrérie sont construites selon des normes plus élevées que la plupart des autres, en raison de notre familiarité avec les structures renforcées."

 MOJ_surface_outposts:0 "Avant-postes de surface"
 MOJ_surface_outposts_desc:0 "Afin d'étendre nos activités de plus en plus loin, nous avons besoin d'installations sécuritaires pour entreposer les approvisionnements et se reposer entre les expéditions. L'établissement d'un corps de construction dans le but spécifique de construire des fortifications de surface nous serait très bénéfique."

 MOJ_underground_workshops:0 "Ateliers souterrains"
 MOJ_underground_workshops_desc:0 "L'expansion de notre base industrielle à l'intérieur de notre réseau de bunkers est notre prochaine priorité. La mise en place de l'industrie au sein de positions fortifiées nous permettra de continuer à créer un rendement respectable même lorsque nous sommes sur le pied arrière, créant ainsi une couche industrielle que notre ennemi ne peut pas prendre jusqu'à la toute fin."

 MOJ_new_technology:0 "Percée technologique"
 MOJ_new_technology_desc:0 "Nos scribes ont fait une série de découvertes scientifiques importantes en peu de temps, élargissant nos horizons et ayant un impact sur tous nos projets de recherche en cours. C'est vraiment incroyable, car ces enseignements nous permettront de poursuivre nos projets de recherche et de restauration plus rapidement que jamais auparavant."

 MOJ_tesla_theory:0 "Théorie Tesla"
 MOJ_tesla_theory_desc:0 "Grâce à nos nouvelles percées dans le domaine de la science, nos scribes ont pu recréer un schéma d'avant-guerre que nous avons trouvé il y a longtemps. Autrefois, nous étions incapables de reproduire ses effets sans résultats désastreux. Aujourd'hui, cependant, nous avons finalement réussi à stabiliser la conception suffisamment pour une utilisation en combat. Les armes Tesla ont été ajoutées à nos armureries !"

 # Mojave Chapter #

 MOJ_chapter_leadership:0 "Dirigeant du Chapitre"
 MOJ_chapter_leadership_desc:0 "Dans la partie la plus profonde de Hidden Valley, un grand débat a lieu entre Elijah et McNamara sur l'avenir du Chapitre de Mojave lui-même. Le cœur du débat est centré sur l'obsession d'Elijah pour le Vieux Monde et son impact négatif sur le Chapitre. L'issue du débat reste incertaine."

 MOJ_elijah:0 "Elijah"
 MOJ_elijah_desc:0 "Après le débat, Elijah a réussi à garder le contrôle de son Chapitre, même avec des tensions encore élevées. Cependant, voir sa détermination à suivre ses ambitions a créé autant d'admiration que de colère, et sa position reste absolue. Elijah est le leader incontesté du Chapitre de Mojave."

 MOJ_scribal_thought:0 "Pensée Scribale"
 MOJ_scribal_thought_desc:0 "Elijah, contrairement à tous les autres anciens, est un scribe : pas un paladin. Son expérience a eu un effet sur son style de gestion, qui met davantage l'accent sur la recherche et l'étude de la technologie d'avant-guerre. Bien que de nombreux membres de la Confrérie aient douté de son approche, personne ne peut nier qu'il obtient des résultats que d'autres aînés ne peuvent tout simplement pas obtenir."

 MOJ_old_world_rumours:9 "Rumeurs de l'Ancien Monde"
 MOJ_old_world_rumours_desc:9 "Elijah a entendu de nombreuses histoires sur la mystérieuse Sierra Madre, et il passe le début de chaque expédition à fixer au loin le sinistre personnage d'Helios One. Ces deux endroits ont de sombres secrets qui attendent d'être découverts, leurs racines plongent profondément dans la conspiration de l'Ancien Monde. Elijah croit avoir la clé pour percer ces secrets."

 MOJ_helios_one:0 "Reprise d'HELIOS One"
 MOJ_helios_one_desc:0 "La RNC nous a volé Hélios One, un élément clé des grandes ambitions d'Elijah. Sa production d'énergie est essentielle pour l'avenir du Chapitre lui-même, et Elijah insiste sur le fait qu'il y a plus à l'installation qu'il n'y paraît. Que ses illusions se vérifient ou non, il n'en demeure pas moins que nous ne pouvons pas permettre à la RNC de contrôler une technologie aussi avancée et dangereuse."

 MOJ_energy_boom:0 "Boom de l'énergie"
 MOJ_energy_boom_desc:0 "HELIOS One est un miracle de la science d'avant-guerre, très avancé même pour l'époque, et complètement irremplaçable dans les Terres Désolées modernes. Elijah, cependant, n'est pas intimidé par ces problèmes auxquels il est confronté. Son esprit fonctionne de façon mystérieuse, et il nous a assuré qu'il sera en mesure de réparer l'installation, avec le temps. Considérant que le rendement a récemment augmenté, ça vaut peut-être la peine d'y croire."

 MOJ_sierra_madre:0 "Sierra Madre"
 MOJ_sierra_madre_desc:0 "Une invitation laissée sans réponse depuis 200 ans appelle les Terres Désolées à une grande ouverture pas comme les autres, où les amis et la liberté attendent. Vous pouvez recommencer, la voix sensuelle promet, et qui ne le veut pas ? Beaucoup d'imbéciles désespérés ont suivi cette voix oubliée, et maintenant, la Confrérie va faire de même."

 MOJ_a_forgotten_hellscape:0 "Un paysage de l'enfer oublié"
 MOJ_a_forgotten_hellscape_desc:9 "L'air sent l'or du vieux monde, la rouille et le sang. La Sierra Madre a tout cela en morceaux, en effet, ses rues sont bordées d'or, étouffées par la rouille et luisantes de sang. Les rumeurs étaient vraies, c'est le paradis sur terre : mais un holocauste nucléaire, 200 ans de négligence, un nuage parasite qui dévore les hommes dans leur armure, et des fantômes mystérieux en ont fait un paysage d'enfer oublié."

 MOJ_what_remains:0 "Ce qu'il en reste"
 MOJ_what_remains_desc:0 "La mort incarnée : c'est la vraie forme de la Sierra Madre. Dans un lieu rempli de mort et de désespoir, il ne reste que peu de choses, mais ces quelques lies sont comme la lumière liquide des étoiles. Des hommes invincibles qui traquent le cœur du casino et des distributeurs automatiques capables de faire quelque chose à partir de presque rien : ce sont les cadeaux que nous ont laissés les fantômes de la Sierra Madre."

 MOJ_a_forgotten_weapon:0 "Une arme oubliée"
 MOJ_a_forgotten_weapon_desc:9 "Les promesses d'Elijah se sont réalisées. Même après que son génie ait ramené HELIOS One à un quart de sa production totale, nous étions sceptiques à l'égard de ses affirmations. Aujourd'hui, cependant, nous avons eu profondément tort dans notre estimation de sa promesse. Une lumière blanche qui divise le ciel d'un cri, ne laissant que des restes carbonisés dans son sillage : c'est l'arme qu'Elijah nous a délivrée."

 MOJ_hardin:0 "Hardin"
 MOJ_hardin_desc:0 "Hardin est sorti vainqueur du débat, bien qu'il ait utilisé une arme au lieu de mots. Debout au-dessus des cendres encore chaudes d'Elijah dans l'obscurité de cet abri, McNamara s'est simplement tenu à l'écart et a laissé Hardin faire son chemin. Pour le meilleur ou pour le pire, ce loyaliste de la côte ouest dirige maintenant le Chapitre de Mojave."

 MOJ_paladin_thought:0 "Pensée du paladin"
 MOJ_paladin_thought_desc:0 "Hardin est un vrai croyant dans la doctrine avancée par la Confrérie occidentale, ayant quelque peu détesté laisser le cœur de la Confrérie derrière lui. Avec son nouveau pouvoir en tant qu'ancien du Chapitre de Mojave, Hardin se concentrera sur ce qu'il connaît le mieux : le combat."

 MOJ_know_our_name:0 "Connaissez notre nom"
 MOJ_know_our_name_desc:0 "Pendant trop longtemps, la Confrérie a été considérée comme faible par la population de Mojave. Ils ne parlent plus de nous dans des tons feutrés, ils parlent plutôt ouvertement de la façon dont ils sont libres de notre influence. Ils nous appellent \"boîtes de conserve\" et plaisantent sur notre doctrine de récupération de la technologie. Plus maintenant ! Bientôt, le jour du jugement viendra pour les Mojave, et ils connaîtront notre nom."

 moj_follow_the_navarro_survivors_tt:9 "§gNous commençons à fournir un petit groupe de paladins pour commencer à fouiller le Mt Charleston dans l'espoir de trouver le bunker de la \"Brigade du Diable\", une cellule des restes de Navarro.

 MOJ_closedown_van_graffs:0 "Punir les Van Graffs"
 MOJ_closedown_van_graffs_desc:0 "La famille Van Graff est bien connue dans toute la Californie, leur nom est souvent murmuré dans les bars et les ruelles. Leur influence sur Redding et la Californie du Nord est immense, mais elle diminue au fur et à mesure que l'on s'éloigne. Il est temps de donner une leçon sévère aux Van Graff : vendre de la technologie d'avant-guerre sur le territoire de la Confrérie raccourcit considérablement votre durée de vie."

 MOJ_gun_runner_caravan_raids:0 "Pillage de caravane des Gun Runners"
 MOJ_gun_runner_caravan_raids_desc:0 "Les Gun Runners sont l'une des seules organisations de l'après-guerre qui peuvent être considérées comme des maîtres artisans. Travaillant à partir de schémas d'avant-guerre bien gardés, les Gun Runners produisent et vendent des armes haut de gamme à un prix élevé. Leurs opérations dans le Mojave ne sont pas aussi bien gardées qu'elles devraient l'être, et il est plus facile de tuer que de piller..."

 MOJ_ncr_raids:0 "Pillages de la RNC"
 MOJ_ncr_raids_desc:0 "La RNC a déshonoré la Confrérie il y a des décennies. Ils n'ont jamais été amicaux envers le Chapitre de Mojave, tirant souvent sur nos patrouilles, et maintenant le temps est venu de les remercier pour leur manque d'hospitalité. L'avant-poste Mojave restera en ruines, le camp de golf brûlera. C'est ce qui arrive quand on emmerde la Confrérie."

 MOJ_contact_the_west:0 "Contacter l'Ouest"
 MOJ_contact_the_west_desc:0 "Enfin, le jour est venu pour le Chapitre de Mojave de se réunir avec la Confrérie de l'Ouest. La campagne de mort et de destruction de Hardin a vu beaucoup de butin transféré à l'armurerie de Hidden Valley, et ses résultats sont sûrs de plaire à l'Occident. Maintenant, tout ce qu'on peut faire, c'est attendre d'avoir de ses nouvelles."

 MOJ_aggressive_policy:0 "Politique agressive"
 MOJ_aggressive_policy_desc:0 "Tirer d'abord et poser des questions plus tard : c'est ce que Hardin a gravé dans l'esprit de ses soldats. Le Chapitre de Mojave est accroché à une corde, entouré d'ennemis, il ne peut tout simplement plus se permettre d'avoir pitié. Dans la quête de Hardin pour brûler le Mojave avec des brûlures au laser, la bonté et la miséricorde sont des reliques du passé. Tout ce qui compte, c'est de savoir si vous pouvez tirer droit et à quel point votre bilan mortel quotidien est élevé."

 MOJ_mcnamara:0 "McNamara"
 MOJ_mcnamara_desc:0 "Avec le contrôle arraché à Elijah, McNamara avait une route difficile devant lui. N'ayant pas le soutien de l'Ouest, et la RNC et la Légion se dirigeant toutes deux vers un itinéraire d'impact centré sur le Mojave, la Confrérie du Mojave avait besoin de s'ouvrir au monde en général."

 MOJ_progressive_thought:0 "Pensée progressiste"
 MOJ_progressive_thought_desc:0 "Ouvrir nos portes au Mojave, c'est aussi ouvrir nos portes aux soucis des rebuts. Non seulement cela, mais l'émergence d'une armure assistée hautement militarisée et puissante portant des guerriers rend les habitants de la région nerveux et méfiant à notre égard. Une solution possible serait d'armer et d'entraîner les forces locales de maintien de la paix et de milice sur les terres sous notre protection, en les faisant entrer dans le troupeau."

 MOJ_the_future:0 "Le futur"
 MOJ_the_future_desc:0 "L'avenir du Chapitre de Mojave est en jeu. L'aîné McNamara prévoit adopter un plan à deux volets pour assurer la continuité de notre existence. Premièrement, nous devons nous allier à la RNC, par le biais de traités ou de l'auto-annexion. Deuxièmement, nous nous engagerons en faveur de la cause de l'aide aux colonies dispersées de Mojave."

 MOJ_ncr_negotiations:0 "Négociations avec la RNC"
 MOJ_ncr_negotiations_desc:0 "Notre premier pas vers la paix dans le Mojave est de garantir le passage en toute sécurité des troupes de nos deux nations dans le Mojave. À cette fin, nous avons préparé un message pour envoyer la RNC, proposant qu'ils soient autorisés à patrouiller sur nos terres en échange d'un éventuel soutien mutuel à l'avenir."

 MOJ_ncr_trade:0 "Commerce avec la RNC"
 MOJ_ncr_trade_desc:0 "Quelle que soit leur réaction à notre dernière négociation, l'ouverture du commerce entre nos deux groupes sera bénéfique pour nous tous."

 MOJ_ncr_alliance:0 "Traité de Sloan"
 MOJ_ncr_alliance_desc:0 "La signature d'un pacte militaire officiel avec la RNC nous permettra de nous concentrer sur notre stabilité interne et nos frontières, tout en nous protégeant contre d'autres ennemis potentiels que nous ne pourrions pas vaincre par nous-mêmes."

 MOJ_help_the_needy:0 "Aidez les plus démunis"
 MOJ_help_the_needy_desc:0 "Notre technologie supérieure pourrait être utilisée pour améliorer l'état des soins médicaux au sein du Mojave. Même la simple réintroduction de soins prénatals et de pratiques d'accouchement appropriées aura un impact énorme sur l'augmentation annuel de la population.

Bien que nous soyons plus militants qu'eux, nous partageons un objectif commun : améliorer le Mojave, et leur vaste expertise améliorera grandement nos efforts de recherche. Mais cela leur permettra aussi de répandre leurs idéaux de non-agression à partir d'une position de pouvoir dans nos rangs."

 MOJ_wastelander_recruitment_desc:0 "En vérité, notre travail dans les Terres Désolées a été généreux tant pour le Chapitre que pour ceux qui sont sous sa protection. Les patrouilles d'hommes d'armes et de chevaliers-paladins protègent nos terres des menaces, les cliniques protègent notre peuple des maladies et des mutations, et notre réseau de fermes et de ranchs nous fournit de la nourriture, du cuir et des guerriers forts. Le temps est venu de permettre enfin à ceux qui vivent sur nos terres d'adhérer à la Confrérie."
