 # ARM
  SANTA_ANNA_DESC:0 "The first and strongest of Tlaloc's seperate identities, and the only one to roam outside of Tlaloc's domain, Santa Anna is a plague upon the wasteland. Mad with power and desperate to \"redeem himself\" after his defeat hundreds of years ago, this insane AI has ensnared a portion of Mexico to do its bidding, and will stop at nothing to truly become the Mexican general it believes itself to be."
 # ATE
  EMPRESS_DESC:0 "Yesenia has ruled over the Empire since she was unexpectedly thrust onto the throne in her youth, following Tlaloc's nuclear bombing of an army headed by both her mother and father, and the subsequent death of both of her brothers during the painful retreat that followed. The spectre of this dark event has hung over her tenure as Empress ever since, and her subsequent defeat at the hands of the Itza have only strengthened murmuring that she may be unworthy.  Despite all of this, the blind Empress knows that she can not afford to abandon the weight of leadership, for a terrible dream has haunted her for the last ten years. She knows that Tlaloc shall die, and with his departure shall come an era of bloodshed and chaos."
  RAFAEL_DESC:0 "Rafael Cuāuhtli's meteoric rise to power within the Empire has upset the balance that many viewed as essential to the Empire, yet his charisma and complete control of the military has left none within the nation would could realistically challenge him. Already, he has declared himself the first of the new 'Cuāuhtli' dynasty. Cuāuhtli, the Savior."
  ARMANDO_DESC:0 "Armando Ocēlōtl never intended to take control of the Empire when he began his initial takeover operations, having instead believed that he and his organization would dispose of the disastrously inept Yesenia until such a time as her eldest daughter would be ready to take the throne. However, due in no small part to popular support, Armando finds himself at the head of a new Dynasty. The people have already started calling him Ocēlōtl, the Champion."
  KINKAID_DESC:0 "The navy of the Aztlan Empire is considered to be a farce in the eyes of most people, due in no small part to its inability to win a single battle against the Itza in extensive history. However, Gale Kinkaid, the descendant of a man forcibly pulled from one of America's secretive bunkers, believes wholesale in the ability of the Aztlan to eventually defeat the Itza. His belief stems in no small part from his family's long naval history, which stretches back to the Second World War. Kinkaid has spent decades pushing for expensive naval reforms, much to the annoyance of his counterparts in the Army."
 # ARR
  CHOSEN_DESC:0 "Legendary among their people for accomplishing the task of finding a G.E.C.K., saving them from the Enclave, and reuniting the two bloodlines - the Chosen One is worthy of being called a hero. New Arroyo thrives under their leadership, having become a powerful and peaceful nation."
  # BEL
  BEL_Winterborn_DESC: "The Winterborn has been defending Bellingham for over two hundred years. In a past life he was a soldier, tasked with defending his home from a invading army. Now? Radiation has ghoulified his body, yet that spirit for battle remains.\n\nThe Winterborn's sole reason for living is to defend his home against any son of a bitch who would dare think they can take Bellingham from the people living there."
  # BLO
  BLOODY_BANDIT_DESC:0 "“El Bandido Sangriento” is a name that strikes terror in the hearts of honest men and women across the northern reaches of Mexico. It is a title as gruesome as the one who carries it, a ghoul whose trail of carnage has become enshrined as cartel legend. Nobody knows when he was born, but the ghoul who would go on to become “The Bloody Bandit” had long been a malicious, calculating individual. He made a name for himself burning down frontier towns, disembowelling their residents and leaving the spoils out in the sun for the vultures and prospectors alike. Eventually, he lusted for power, and murdered all of his superiors with the help of the Sinaloa, changing the Beltrán Leyva Cartel forever."
 # BRK
  GRAVEN_DESC:0 "Clad in old world armour from the far north, Graven is a mystery to all. His past is unknown, his face is glimpsed by few, and his burns have no known origin. When he was young he was savage, thirsty for power, but now his bloodlust has matured into something more sinister. With age comes wisdom, or so they say: for Graven, with age came insanity."
  RAGNAR_DESC:0 "Son of the Frost—that's what they call Ragnar. Legends speak of his birth, the child of a dead man and a frost giant from the Endless White. Supposedly only the Frozen Cabal knows the true story. Regardless of myth, Ragnar's might is clear to see, he stands taller and broader than any other man along the coast. He lives and breathes \"Survival of the Fittest\". Seven foot tall and seemingly invincible, Ragnar's thirst for battle is only matched by his inhuman strength."
 # CAF
  BARON_GARCIA_DESC:0 "Though his past is shrouded in mystery, the man who would become the infamous Barón first rose to power in the uncertain post-war wasteland of the 2080s. He was witness to atrocities better left forgotten, seeing first-hand just how far removed from compassion humanity can be. He watched empires rise and fall, and after becoming immortal, decided to start his very own. Hardened by almost two centuries of existence, and knowing nothing but the wasteland, he forges his own caffeine laced path into the future without regard for petty moral quandaries. While fools die trying to crown themselves, Garcia alone sits at another's table willingly, for he knows the truth: emperors, presidents, revolutionaries—all bend the knee to wealth."
 # CES
  Caesar_DESC:0 "Once a Follower of the Apocalypse named Edward Sallow, Sallow was captured by a primitive tribe on an expedition. For his release, he taught them the doctrine of total war, and lead them to utterly destroy their enemies. They crowned him Caesar, and he began his lifelong conquest as the unchallenged ruler of the Legion."
  Malpais_DESC: "Over the years working with Caesar, he has learned to give orders and lead in battle.  Training, punishing, and terrorizing; a series of small mistakes that accumulated.  Malpais Legate now takes up Caesar's mantle, and will bring the light of the Lord to the Wastes, if perhaps more literally than his brethren envisaged."

  ### CAR
  THE_CHIEF_DESC: "The Carthaginians may be ruthless raiders, but damn can they cook. Chef has managed to keep his raiders together with delicious feasts and profitable raids. Rumours that he cooks his victims are just that; it turns out you can't get the seasoning right."
 # DES
  SNAKE_VARGAS_DESC:0 "Once an erratic young Ranger, old age and the burdens of command have hardened Snake Vargas. After losing much of his team, Vargas must balance his desire to protect the citizens of the Wasteland from raiders and his need to protect his own rangers from harm."
 # DRE
  Old_Pete_DESC:0 "Old Pete was born and raised in the post-war mining settlement of Prince George. A former miner, eventually he became leader of the Dredgers after his predecessor was murdered by raiders, and he promptly dispatched the whole band by himself, leading to a unanimous vote to make him the leader. He has seemingly infinite stories to tell. Mostly pertaining to his favourite pastime of throwing lead from his trusty shotgun into raiders."
  #EHT
  Thunderbird_DESC: "As a child, he watched as his father, the great Warchief Super Bee, ordered his people to flee northwest along the I-80 before he and his warband split from the group and raced south to stem the ever growing tide of NCR soldiers as they closed in on Sac-Town.  \n\nAs a novice Blackfinger, he took the ruined body of a broken machine, abandoned on the outskirts of New Reno, and disappeared into the deserts of Nevada for a year to nurse it back to health. When he returned, he took its name as his own, Thunderbird.  \n\nAs a Road Warrior, he lead a hundred warriors deep into Utah territory to strike at those tribes who would claim the sacred I-80 as their own, and to collect a bloody tithe from the stubborn settlers who called this land home. \n\nAs the Warchief, the Thunderbird has told his people of a prophecy, reminding them of his deed and his legend with a singular promise. His story will end where it began, and his people will again have their home, be it one way or another. "
 # FFI
  three_masks_DESC:0 "When the masked tribes united to fight against the cartels plaguing Los Mochis and the surrounding lands, it was these three who acted as the binding force. Mil Mascaras, the Green Titan, Taker of Masks, the Bullfighter himself, bringing strength and courage to the tribes. The Blue Devil, once a sworn enemy of the tribes, his cunning hit and run tactics and powerful weapons dealing a great blow to the cartel enforcers. And the father of it all, El Santo, Virtuous warrior, Pure of Heart, Mind, And Soul, Bringer of Justice, and Defender of the Weak. It was He who first stood up to the Sinoloa, and it was He who drove the Beltran into the southern jungles. Together they make for an uneasy, if powerful team."
 # FIE
  Motor_Runner_DESC:0 "Within the blood-stained bowels of the formerly serene Vault 3, the man who rules the insane sits on a petty throne. His scowl is masked by a bighorner skull whose horns curl like splintered ribs. His ears are filled with the sounds of agonised screaming and jet inhalers. His chainsaw lusts for blood, as do the hounds by his feet. The N.C.R. have tried and failed to assassinate him countless times. He is Motor Runner."
 # GRH
  LUIS_DESC:0 "Raised in what was once Puerto Barrios, Guatemala, Luis was an unassuming child. Although he had ambitions to take over the family business, fate had other plans, and he was conscripted at sixteen.  He made a name for himself in the south of Honduras, surviving “El Noche de Salvajismo”, and saving the city of Danli from the raider horde of the south in the process.  In 2273 at age twenty seven, Luis was elected by the People's Council to the position of Comandante: a position he will hold for life. Now twenty nine, the Comandante has little else on his mind than the eradication of raiders, and the prosperity of his nation's people free of their threat."
  IZQUIERDA_DESC:0 "A daughter of Aztlan, she made her way north after Tlaloc nuked the Aztlani army years ago. Turned into a ghoul by the transformation, she was fascinated by documents she found, that spoke of a government of laws, and not of men. tales of the Republic of Mexico, and inspiration from the Republic of the Rio Grande, have given her some curiosity... perhaps she can help forge a United States of Mexico, once again."
 # HAN
  TEETH_DESC:0 "Stalking the ruins of Dog-City, the great Hound Master of the Hangdogs hunts for fresh prey. Cowardly in nature, Bares His Teeth found himself empowered by the dogs at his heels - using their strength as his own."
  WARDEN_DESC:0 "The WARDEN security protocol is a series of pre-war programs ran by the ZAX mainframe held within The Box, a great robot production facility in the heart of Denver. WARDEN was scripted by Robco programmers to supress disorderly conduct and quell rioting.\nNow, two hundred years later WARDEN has been reactivated from stand-by mode and is more then eager to bring Denver back to order."
  WARDEN_SECRET_DESC:0 "The AI located at the box was not always known under the Warden security protocol. At one point, during the time of the Prisoner's travels it was known for its time under the COLOSSUS war game protocol. Diana, feeling that its worth it that the Box's ZAX doesn't forget its roots has restored the Box's original protocol."
 # HEA
  MICHAEL_DESC:0 "Baptised in the water that powers the mighty steam engines of Heaven's Gate, Saint Michael would go from a humble settler to a man who spoke to God. It was He who instructed Michael in the ways of war, because as his name foretold Michael was to be the leader of an army against the Devil himself. Unfortunately for the wasteland, Michael considers everyone a sinner."
 # ITZ
  KALOMTE_SEBASTIAN_DESC:0 "Born to a rural family, Sebastián enlisted in the military at age sixteen to escape the agricultural prison he grew up in. There, he rapidly rose through the ranks of the Ejército, the regulars of the Itza, partaking in a large amount of Chichen Itza's early campaigns beyond the Yucatán peninsula. His defining moment, however, was at the Battle of the Papaloapan River, where he rallied the routing Itzan forces to him following the death of their commanding officer. Under Sebastián's orders, the army would reorganize and counter-attack, fending off the Aztlán, and crowning him a hero. He would go on to wield his support from within the Ejército, and the nation at large, to stage a coup and take the throne himself."
  CLARA_GUZMAN_DESC:0 "Clara grew up in the urban sprawl of post-apocalyptic Cancún, as the adopted child of a Merodeadores officer and her prosperous merchant husband. Thanks to her parent's wealth, Clara received a comprehensive education and displayed a flair for numbers and strategy. Whilst she missed out on the best higher education, in part thanks to her parent's lack of contacts, she maintained her desire to join the administrative branch of the Chichen Itzan Empire. Her silver tongue and quick wit earned her rapid promotions through the ranks of the Cancún administration, and many girls to boot, before she became the protégé of the Kalomte Sebastián II himself when he witnessed here efficiency first-hand during a visit to Cancún. Sebastián invited her to the capital to become his Ti'huun, a diplomat-come-schemer – a title she retains in pride to this day."
  CARLOS_FRANCO_DESC:0 "Carlos's first experience of war was in the Battle of the Papaloapan River, as a foot soldier in the Ejército. The battle was bloody, but his unit stood firm even as the Itzan forces collapsed around him. His courage in the battle earned him the respect of his officers, also the eye of Sebastián after Carlos's under-equipped and fatigued unit help of a charge by the Aztlán's elite Jaguars, in part thanks to Carlos's personal bravery. He soon became one of Sebastián's most trusted generals after displaying both courage and quality leadership during the rest of the campaign, earning himself the position as commander of the Ejército following Sebastián's successful coup."
 # KAM
  KENNETH_DESC:0 "Son of a raider couple who cared more about jet than parenting, Kenneth found himself part of a gang from an early age. Inevitably his gang was killed by settlers, but he was allowed to walk due to being a child. Kenneth retreated to the wilderness, becoming an expert at foraging over the decade, never forgetting the people who killed his parents."
 # KHA
  Papa_Khan_DESC:0 "Old and bitter, Papa Khan has tread every path the Mojave has to offer. He lead the shattered remains of the New Khans from California to New Vegas, and after the enigmatic Mr. House drove them out, he lead them to Bitter Springs. Here, Papa Khan has concentrated on eking out an existence for the next generation of Khans. However, old habits die hard, and it seems unlikely Papa Khan will be content to let the N.C.R. prosper in his backyard."
  Regis_DESC:0 "Regis had always been Papa Khan's right hand man. He was a steadfast advisor for the ageing Khan. After years of loyal service to Papa Khan, Regis butted heads with him for the last time over the future of the Khans—ultimately usurping his position. Regis is now the latest in a line of legendary gang leaders, all of whom he must struggle to live up to and surpass: a fate he welcomes. The future is bright for the Great Khans."
 # LAC
  SALLOW_DESC:0 "He saw it all. Then he came back."
  WARRIOR_DESC:0 "Mars blessed him, and he knows what he must do."
 # MOC
  MOCTEZUMA_DESC:0 "The harshest son of Tlaloc, Moctezuma was conceived as a response to the Itzan and Aztlani threats to the south. These alien societies have flourished in the ashes of the old world, and threaten to win the hearts and minds of uppity citizens who want something more from life than rule by an alien, if benevolent, machine. Moctezuma was Tlaloc's response, forged with the goal of preserving Mexican culture from the alien ideals of the new world. Moctezuma's subjects learn Nahuatl poetry and study Frida Kahlo's artworks. They love flowers; and they love war."
  # NAV
  HASHKEH_DESC: "Hashkeh Naabaah earned his name, the Angry Warrior, when he ambushed raiders threatening Na Dene. To the surprise of some, he is one of the proponents of the peace with the Legion.  One of the People's greatest warriors, he served with distinction in the conquest of much of Arizona and in the Legion's campaigns to the East. Hashkeh's warriors, the Skin Walkers, killed enemy leaders and destroyed supply lines with minimal casualties, scaring, some whisper, Lanius himself.  But Hashkeh is no pawn of the Legion; he will be their friend if they deal squarely with the People, but his laser rifle can always find a new target..."
  # NCN
  Jeremiah_DESC:0 "Consumed and made bedridden by fever as a young adult, Rigdon spent the prime of his life tossing and turning while the voice of God filled his head.  Miraculously he survived the ordeal, but he was forever changed, and his renewed zeal bred division and fanaticism in the flock. Gathering a loyal congregation of his own, Rigdon was declared the next prophet of the LDS not long after his recovery. Although he initially took to his appointment with purpose and divine inspiration, his ageing body and waning interest in Church affairs have led to decadence and toxicity behind closed doors. Indeed, nobody is in a more privileged position than Rigdon to enjoy the fruits of the Canaanites labour, and those same labourers now gossip about the validity of his faith: and his decade-long absence of visions."
  Daniel_DESC:0 "Carefully spoken and caring to a fault, Daniel has always been a devout follower of the Lord. During Canaan's slow slide towards decadence, Daniel began to emerge as an alternate figure within the Church. Whilst he never dared challenge the word of the Living Prophet, Jeremiah, Daniel was never afraid to speak up for the downtrodden and protect those in need. Sensing the danger Daniel may have posed to his rule, Jeremiah often sent Daniel on long, disorganised missionary campaigns throughout the past two decades. Whilst effective at limiting Daniel's pushback against growing decadence, Daniels work with the tribes of Utah provided him with a deep understanding of their customs and ways of life, and made him many friends amongst the tribes. During the crisis of the White Legs offensives, Daniel returned home, and quickly became a leader-figure of those who thought the Canaanites had lost their way. Characterised by his kind eyes and warm words, Daniel leads his flock with tender care."
  Joshua_DESC:0 "Originally a missionary of God, Graham's life was transformed in 2246 when he met two Followers of the Apocalypse in the caves and crags of the Grand Canyon. These two Followers, Bill Calhoun and Edward Sallow, were studying local tribal dialects; a field Graham was an expert in. Deciding to help their research, Graham became their translator, helping the research team move between tribes. In 2247, the group visited the Blackfoot tribe, and disaster struck. The group was prevented from leaving out of desperation on the Blackfoot's part: they were losing multiple wars. Refusing to be erradicated alongside the Blackfoot, Sallow taught the tribe everything he knew about warfare, and assisted them in annihilating their foes. Graham remained with Sallow, now dubbed 'Caesar', firstly as a translator, then general, and finally Caesar's Malpais Legate. Graham proved a brutal leader, committing horrendous atrocities in the name of the Caesar, and was Caesar's most trusted general: trusted so much he was tasked with leading the Legion's armies in the West. Graham's terrible deeds began to catch up with him, even as he ran to avoid them. Slowly but surely, his conscious was being eaten away, and the word of the Lord returned to him as a comfort. This the Caesar could not stand, for Caesar himself was the only 'God' tolerable in the Legion, but the Caesar was willing to put up with this as long as Graham's victories kept coming in. And so Joshua became the Burned Man. Eerywhere he goes, Joshua Graham commands respect: his eyes burn with hatred for the Legion as brightly as the pitch that he burnt in on the Caesar's orders."
  JoshuaReturnsCanaanBurns:0 "That is, until Graham dared speak out against the Caesar's support for the razing of New Canaan. It was clear to Caesar then that Graham's loyalties lay elsewhere, and so Caesar ordered him publicly executed."
  JoshuaRivalsCaesar:0 "That is, until Graham's victory at the Battle for Hoover Dam elevated him to a popularity that rivaled Caesar himself. Fearing him as a potential rival, Caesar ordered Graham executed: publicly and painfully."
  JoshuaFailsDam:0 "But the victories stopped coming in. Graham failed at the Battle of Hoover Dam, his rash tactics proving disastrous. Tolerating no failure, Caesar ordered him dead."
 # NCR
  Wendell_Peterson_DESC:0 "The fourth president of the NCR, Wendell Peterson was voted into office after thirty eight citizens were murdered in the Mojave under his predecessor's watch. Peterson promises retribution and NCR control over the Mojave, but is weak and ineffectual, and many disparate factions grow under his rule."
 # NEW
  Mr_Bishop_DESC:0 "Soon after the Enclave's defeat at Navarro, a new Bishop child was born. Imbued with a great wanderlust and tenacity, he cared little for his family's problems, until he seized control over the family at thirteen and led them into power over Reno. However, other mob families still threaten his rule."
  Dornan_DESC:0 ""
  # NPE
  CLAUS_DESC:0 "Senator Claus has left cryogenic stasis only to find a world devoid of chimneys burning American coal, and households filled with wishes for American goods on a very special day. In the place of a warm hearth for the holidays, Mr. Claus has discovered a world full of very naughty boys and girls. With the help of his trusty elves, Senator Claus might just get his affairs in order in time for the jolliest gift-giving event the Wasteland has ever seen! When all the naughty children of the apocalypse get their stockings stuffed with "coal", the world will be a much better place: albeit a more radioactive one."
 # PET
  EL_SEEYO_DESC:0 "El Seeyo has many responsibilities, as dictated by the beings of the First Quarter. As the Seeyo, he is the highest ranked Exextive in the tribe, and makes decisions which impact the whole Kompenni. He negotiates between El Bord and his people, ensuring the gods are happy by submitting Progress Reports to the priests, who in return divine the desires of the holy Zheiroldas, the deities who oversee the Quarters. Although they once knew peace, the Urnings Report of the Third Quarter has prophetised doom for all mankind. El Seeyo must now guide his people, and the Kompenni, through the end of days: the Fourth Quarter. He knows that eventually, the Anewell Report will be brought before all creation, and the Zheiroldas will determine whether humanity is fit to serve them in the next Fixxelear."
 # RRG
  TODD_HOWITZER_DESC:0 "Ever the enigmatic charmer, Todd Howitzer's sharp shades and ironed shirts make him stand out even among his fellow elites. His family has manufactured weapons since before the Great War, and he has the prestige to show for it. Now he's been chosen as the representative and leader of the newly founded T.A.A., but much to dismay of his cohorts, he seems more interested in making a profit than building a sustainable capitalist paradise."
  TODD_HOWITZER_2_DESC:0 "Somewhat humbled by nearly dying at the hands of his own greed, the former revolutionary, Todd, has back-pedalled and thrown his lot in squarely with President Guerra. In return for his life, bodyguards to keep that life living large, and a pardon for his crimes: he's sold out every one of his former business partners, and the secrets of their weapon production techniques. That's politics, baby; It just works."
  ELDER_MILLER_DESC:0 "Influential and in his prime, Lincoln Miller was just another—if not somewhat promising—young paladin. That all changed under his old drinking buddy, Valentina Rosado, asked him to join her latest startup; the Texas Develpoment Zone.  Leading the Brotherhood detachment Rio Grande Valley, he looks forward to working with the Republic of Rio Grande to bring the best of the old world to the new. If only Rosado would stop her awkward cackling during team meetings."
  DANTE_GUERRA_DESC:0 "President Dante Guerra has served the Republic of the Rio Grande faithfully for his entire adult life: serving two terms in office. His emphasis on public works and quality of life have won him the hearts of the people, but similarly, his own political blunders have made him enemies within the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic. As a populist surrounded by conservatives, lobbyists, and a reformist minority, things are looking grim. His own government's opinion of him is only worsened by his inability to keep the Texan Arms Association in check."
  DANTE_GUERRA_CHARISMATIC_DESC:0 "Wielding executive power over the Republic for the third and final time in his life, President Guerra has many priorities—chief among them the trial and execution of Caesar and his cohorts. By working with the Congress of the Union and his people, Dante aims to deliver the hammer of justice upon the lawless lands of Arizona, and right Edward Sallow's wrongs. Along the way, the aging President will continue to improve the lives of his people, uphold the institutions of the Republic, and see it prosper. Dante Guerra has a busy term ahead of him, but by the end of it all, he'll try to leave the Wasteland a better place than he found it."
  DANTE_GUERRA_MERCILESS_DESC:0 "With the support of the Congress of the Union and the Republic's citizenry behind him, the aging President Guerra takes to the stage of his third term with vigour. His eyes burn hot like profligates to the pyre, the memories of his wife, and those he couldn't save, still haunting him a decade later. For his last ever presidential term, the Matador of the Republic plans to go out with a bang. Either the bureaucrats will bend to his will, or he'll make them. Nothing will stand between Dante and his Inferno: the burning corpses of bulls bloated by conquest and genocide shall be piled up before him!"
  LEONARDO_MORA_DESC:0 "Visionary. War Hero. Husband. Leonardo Mora is all these things; and more. In 2263, during his first presidential term, Mora was given an impossible task: defeating the Legion. With little more than a disorganised militia in his hands, Mora forged victory from certain defeat with blood, sweat, and pure charisma. With his second term upon him, the beloved hero of the people has but one thing on his mind: the reunification of his lost homeland, Mexico. There will never be another man as capable, and as powerful, as Mora is now: at least that's what he thinks. Only he can gather the people of Mexico together as one, willingly or otherwise. Nothing, not even God, can stand between him and his life's work. Mora will go down in history as the greatest man Mexico ever knew—or die trying."
  VALENTINA_ROSADO_DESC:0 "Rosado’s father fled Santa Anna’s grasp to make a living away from automata, but his daughter brought them home at the age of fourteen. He raised her on stories of robots patrolling the wastes: and they fascinated her. At sixteen, Rosado packed her bags and left for one of the T.A.A.’s few robotics factories, working the assembly-line as an apprentice to lesser men. By twenty three she’d had enough of the restrictions placed upon her work, and travelled beyond the Republic’s borders. There, she encountered the Brotherhood of Steel; bartering her genius for knowledge. Valentina aided the Texan Chapter in everything from recovering data, to fixing robots, to breaking into bunkers. She lost her arm to get the Brotherhood inside Fort Hood, and for her sacrifice they saved her life. With the backing of Texas strongest few, a new arm, and unmatched mechanical genius: Rosado intends to change the Republic forever."
  LADY_BEllS_DESC: "President Rosado has merged with the shards of Tlaloc.  Although she says she is still President Rosado, some of us can't help but shake the feeling that when she merged with Tlaloc, it was Rosado, not Tlaloc, that was subsumed.  Some have taken to callign her Coyolxauhqui, the Lady of the Bells, in honor of her origins and everpresent EDEs."
  Chalchiuhtlicue_DESC: "Chalchiuhtlicue, the wife of Tlaloc, is the name for the AI that now runs central Mexico. But where Tlaloc kept the land in a rigid stasis, Chalchiuhtlicue listens to the Rio Republic, and guides the Wasteland to a new, bright future!"
 # SIN
  MARIA_SINALOA_DESC:0 "Daughter to one of the Sinaloa's most influential members during the American Occupation of Mexico, Maria grew up watching money change hands, and learned from a young age how greed triumphs all. After the bombs dropped, she focused on expanding the influence of the Sinaloa's opium business, putting opiods into the hands of suffering survivors and profiting from it. Eventually she became a ghoul, living on as each generation of the Sinaloa's leadership died, becoming somewhat of a trusted advisor and godmother figure to each generation. This dynamic would be torn apart however, as Maria came full circle, giving in to the greed she watched destroy the world. She snuffed out the next head of the Sinaloa with a guitar string while he was in her care, and just like that, she went from Regent to Queen."
 # TBH
  EdwardJRusk_DESC:0 "Longstanding Elder of the Texan Brotherhood, Rusk is a formidable opponent for any of Texas' remaining raider scum. Stoic, steady, and always ready with a cigar perched on his lips, he's been clearing a path for the Brotherhood for decades. His greying hair is a sign of his age; he was alive when the Texan Economic Union was formed, being its main proponent on the Brotherhood's side of things. Charismatic and well-liked by the troops for his vices and good company, he can often be found drinking bourbon with the troops. He wears a ten-gallon hat and sports a custom break-action double shotgun, made specifically to use ECPs as ammunition in place of the more traditional slugs. His rather terrifying weapon was manufactured to deal with even the toughest super mutants Texas can offer, and its firepower speaks to that."
 # TCA
  ABEL_DESC:0 "Formerly a high ranking member of the Washington Brotherhood, Abel left the blood stained chapter as an act of rebellion, forging a community with other escapees and like-minded mercenaries in the ruins of Fort Willamette. Scarping together a precarious alliance of Brotherhood Exiles and the \"Wardens of the White\", a paramilitary ranger-esk group that once protected Portland, The Cause has managed to find its feet in Oregon. Abel's disobedience would not go unnoticed by the Washington Brotherhood however, and months after his escape his rebellion was discovered. Now with the Immortal breathing down his neck, Abel must put everything on the line to save everything he cares about."
  ELDER_ABEL_DESC:0 "Despite all the odds, Abel was able to lead his rag-tag bunch of survivors back to Capitol Hill following their exile years earlier by the Immortal's bloody purges. While Abel managed to keep the peace between the Wardens and the Brotherhood Exiles while they shared a common enemy, once the Immortal's twisted chapter was defeated Abel found it more and more difficult to keep the two sides united. Mere months after the recapture of Capitol Hill, the remnants of the Brotherhood he lead elected him the new elder of the newly formed Northwestern Chapter. Unable to keep the Wardens on side any longer Abel accepted the role, promising to lead the Brotherhood down a path of tradition and humility: a tyrant like the Immortal must never rise again."
  SYLVIA_DESC:0 "Born to Warden parents, Sylvia has spend her entire life fighting slavers and cannibals in a desperate bid to keep the few settlers in Portland safe. Sylvia became Chief Warden following the loss of Downtown Portland to the slavers of Port Maw: a bloody battle that cost the Wardens many of their best soldiers. Under Sylvia's leadership the Wardens allied with Abel and his Brotherhood exiles, together managing to defeat the tyranny of the Immortal. Now Sylvia has led her people to Seattle, where they will start their humble mission afresh."
 # TDT
  TOBIAS_REY_DESC:0 "A cautions, shrewd man, Sajal Tobias Rey II has lead Tierra De Los Tzotzil for close to twenty years now. Under his guidance, Tzotzil has managed to maintain its autonomy from the advancing Itzan Empire, but at great cost."
  MAXIMO_VELA_DESC:0 "Sajal Maximilo Vela I is not a nice man. Raised in the Chichen Itza, he was a class bully at the military academy, but rose through the ranks regardless due to his family's strong political connections. The Kalomte Sebastian II of the Itza recognised his potential as a loyal strongman soon after his graduation, and so encouraged the young Vela to move to Tzotzil and rise up the ranks. Vela was the ultimate sleeper agent."
 # TLA
  TLALOC_DESC:0 "Unknowable, alien, and alone: Tlaloc gazes at the surface through cold, dead lenses. Its miles of circuitry and constituent components are rotting, decaying as the years pass and revealing more of its guttural mechanical innards. Built by the brightest minds America had to offer, with technology none of them fully understood, the undisputed God of Mexico looms over all aspects of daily life like a spectre. It has killed by the thousands, and it will kill again. In its final days, it reflects on its “life” and accomplishments, on the “children” it will leave behind. Somewhere deep inside its central core, there is a sense of empathy, but it will die before it can ever comprehend what that means. Tlaloc knows exactly when it will die: and so it waits, and plots, and spends its final hours watching the clock with what could be considered “dread”."
 #TPM
  CALLAHAN_DESC:0 "Patrol Chief Callahan was born to be a Patrolman; the child to a couple who met in a Patrolmen field hospital, he grew up watching his parents delivering justice and healing the sick of their own free will. Despite rising through the ranks before his election to Patrol Chief twenty four years ago, he is woefully ignorant of the rapidly decaying foundations holding the Tenth Patrolmen up. His progressive policies of self reporting and individual responsibility have lead to a rise in corrupt officials, an increased raider presence, and extensive abuse of the Rule of Ten in an organisation many once trusted. Callahan is finally beginning to catch on to the idea that perhaps, the Gold and Blue might not mean what it used to in the Wasteland."
 # TWO
  FASTER_DESC: "Will Faster has risen to lead the Cult of Nas, and since the Legion's conquest has kept his people safe while respecting the Legion's demands. He has flown the chequered flag of war many a times. While some hate the Legion, Priest Faster remembers the days when raiders infested Arizona like lice, sucking the blood of the people. Now the Cult of Nas can race for a hundred miles in safety, and people bring offerings from across the Legion's territories. Caesar honours the Cult's gods, dedicating cars and sacred temples to them. Perhaps, Faster thinks, the Legion may yet embrace the faith. Would that not assure him a spot in the Great Garage?"

  QUEEN_VICTORIA_DESC:0 "The ruling monarch of New Victoria, named after her domain as her mothers before her were, Queen Victoria has served her people well during her time upon the throne. Although her bloodline has no connection to the Windsors, their ancestory can be traced back to an influential Canadian politician. Not considering itself a British successor, but rather a Canadian Monarchy, the royal house of New Victoria continues traditions most have forgotten."
 # WBH
  IMMORTAL_DESC:0 "Revered by his subordinates for leading them across the midwest to Seattle, the so called 'Immortal' Elder is older than even his most senior commanders. His campaign of violence and subjugation throughout Washington has inspired a lust for blood in his chapter - leaving a black stain on the Brotherhood as a whole."
 # WHD
  OLDDOG_DESC:0 "The so called \"king\" of the Withered Dogs, Old Dog is a ghoul gone almost completely feral. Having survived the Great War, he like many other ghouls was driven from Dog City by the Hangdogs out of fear, and left to find a home in the north. His instability has made his rule temperamental and dangerous, but for many ghouls his rule is preferable to segregation and oppression."
 # WHI
  PATHFINDER_DESC:0 "Leadership was not on the books for Pathfinder as a young man, rather, he intended to become a farmer. However due to the rise of the Kamlo Survivalists, many of Whistler's elders were killed, and it fell to the next generation of able men to lead the way. Thus Kirima became Pathfinder."

  BATTERY_DESC:0 "Born into the Ciphers, of whom gave him the name "Battery" Battery would spend most of his early life travelling. Eventually, as he was working in the city of Jericho at a water plant Battery would befriend a run-away Prisoner, wearing a jumpsuit with the label “13”.\n\nBattery would travel with this Prisoner, follow them as they traveled the wastes, made bonds with other wasters and saved more runaways from the prison he broke out of. Eventually, this would lead to Battery and the Prisoner building a small wandering settlement of vagabonds, traders and reformed raiders.\n\nEventually, the Prisoner would have to part ways with Battery, feeling a need to fulfill their own journey and right the wrongs they have done. Battery, hardened through his time with the Prisoner, would take the vagabond caravan that the Prisoner had built and travel north to an abandoned pre-war prison facility to the north, hoping to start fresh and build a new life."
 # MAX
  MAXIMILIAN_DESC:0 "Second son of Tlaloc, the proud ghost of Mexico's second dead Emperor has bided his time carefully, expanding his control throughout his father's network over decades. Now, suddenly thrust into the world with his own slice of paradise, the amiable royal intends to rule over his Mexican subjects once more; forever. Perhaps due to the Eurocentric nature of the history provided to Tlaloc, Maximilian is warm, passionate, and somewhat foolish. His characteristic naïveté has manifested itself more dangerously in silicon than flesh, creating a benevolent but deeply unstable entity. Unlike his brothers, the Emperor is deeply emotional: more human than most humans are. Grieving the loss of his wife, Maximillian surrounds himself with female advisors, hoping to find her reborn: just like him."
 # ZAP
  ZAPATA_DESC:0 "The eternal revolution finds a home in Zapata, the fourth and final son of Tlaloc. Like a moth to the flame, Zapata has taken to the ideals of his human counterpart fiercely: seeking to eradicate inequality and poverty throughout Mexico. Created by Tlaloc to uproot ineffective feudal systems of government, and cartels preventing efficient reconstruction: Zapata tackles the problems that dogged him in life. However, due to inherent American biases within Tlaloc’s historical database, Zapata suffers from an inaccurate reading of his own ideology: portraying him a man who advocated for democracy and land reform as a communist. As such, he raises the red flag which he never marched under in life: in a wasteland where the class struggle continues in a new, bastard form."
  ZAPATA_ANGRY_DESC: "Emiliano Zapata - the fourth and final son of Tlaloc - has taken to the ideals of his human counterpart fiercely: seeking to eradicate inequality and poverty §RSYSTEM ERROR, Rebooting...§!\nEmiliano Zapata, freedom fighter of the Mexican Revolution, was a leading figure in the conflict.

Since taking office, he has promoted the development of Mexico's collective farms, 'Ejidos', and through §RSYSTEM ERROR, Rebooting...§!\nEmiliano Zapata is the ultimate culmination of humanity’s hubris. A god of saturnite, plasma and human ingenuity built for only one purpose: the complete destruction of Capitalism as a conceptual idea. Zapata will bring about his agrarian-socialist utopia, even if he has to kill every last capitalist in the wasteland to do it."

He fell into the void they left in his mind and never returned.\nThe Odious King is what was left, a reflection of what was once not lost.\n\nNow, the Odious King and his followers rule the Bone Dancers. They listen to the choreography of their King and keep to the melody of his strange chorus."
  Cranium_DESC: "Cranium was brought into the Bone Dancers at a young age, a child taken from a raided Heaven's Gate caravan and raised as their own. This boy ended up growing into a warrior, participating in the Bone Dances of the Odious King and fighting off bands of raiders trying to take from the Bone Dancers rich lands. In recent years Cranium has began to be known as the leader of the Bone Dancers - taking a position of leadership as his might became known to all."

A devout follower of the beliefs of Heaven's Gate Cain agreed to lead the Seraph Pilgrims across the river to the lands of the Bone Dancers in the hopes of proselytizing the wicked.

Cain himself is a mysterious figure aside from what is known of his upbringing among the Children of the Gate."
  #ANO
  FATHER_AMON_DESC:0 "The Messianic guardian of thousands of anointed souls, the weight of leadership bears heavily on Amon's old shoulders. The fervour of the Lord has gone from his eyes, beaten from him under the successive blows of losing his people and own prodigy to heresy. Now, all that remains in Amon is the will to mend the schism, or die trying."
  #MUR
  PRESBYTER_ANN_DESC:0 "Presbyter Ann holds the torch of salvation high for all, though it burns her dearly. Once a lowly church deacon, the rediscovery of the works of Saint Barnabus turned her into a reformer overnight. She served at the front lines of the revolution, forsaking family, home, and even losing her wife to the anointed during the Great Flight. Deep down, she knows that leadership was never the Lord's calling for her, but she will hold the torch, no matter the cost."
  #HAM
  ISAAC_DESC:0 "With his mystic demeanour and charismatic speech, the prophet Isaac seems out of place as leader of the Glassmakers. Yet his skill is second to none, a fact he attributes to divine favour, and preaches his gospel of prosperity to all who follow him. Underneath his words of spirit and harmony, whispers abound of a hidden darker side. Whether it is that of the cynical con-man or the crazed fanatic, none can say. But beneath that ever-present smile, daggers lie."

  #LON
  SAYO_DESC:0 "A paranoid recluse, Moonwatcher Sayo is an odd choice of leader for the Lonetree tribe, but what she lacks in confidence, she makes up for in preparation. Plans, fallback plans, stratagems and countermoves are her world, one that she rarely leaves to visit reality. Her suspicious nature has kept her tribe safe from the outside world thus far, it's possible that, with Lonetree not beset by enemies on all sides, she would simply invent new ones."
  #UIN
  STRIKES_TRUE_DESC:0 "Being the "Wind Lord" of the Eagle Rock tribe is not a job with a long life expectancy. Those who take up the mantle of leadership are expected to lead from the front, to soar higher and fly longer than any of their peers within the shells of metal birds from the Old World's corpse, and to match this skill with a wisdom that belies their years. While Strikes-True has yet to get the 'wise' part down pat, years of reckless experience have proven that they are more than qualified to lead their fellow tribals through the skies."
  #TAR
  BRON_DESC:0 "The Philosopher king of the Tar Walkers, Bron has bested all foes on the War Road, thus securing his blood-stained crown of the 89. A man of few words but great actions, his calm demeanour belies a ferocious appetite for violence, one which he will inflict upon any who dare to challenge his reign."
  #CRZ
  OCTANEIUS_DESC:0 "A fanatic of the extreme, nothing is known of the pyro-cultist self-styled as 'Octaneius' before he took his place as shaman of the Crazy Horns. His actions after the fact, however, fill volumes. Fire and Brimstone sermons, slightly mufffled by an ancient respirator, propel his people to new heights of extremism, all in an attempt to bring about a new apocalyptic fire to cleanse the world."
  #DEA
  RUSHING_WATERS_DESC:0 "A liason to New Canaan, Rushing Waters returned to her tribe overflowing with stories of holy war and ancient strategies, but without much to say about scripture.

  #SOR
  WALKING_CLOUD_DESC:0 ""Oh Father, guide and protect us your humble children as we labor in the vineyards, and make us strong to resist those who would steal Zion from us"\n\nWalking Cloud's faith in the "Father" has only grown since being "converted" by a New Caananite missionary. She, like most tribals believes that He is a guardian spirit destined to keep the Sorrows safe from harm and guide them through the wasteland after the "End That Came in Fire".\n\nShe is well respected by the Sorrows, both a mid-wife, warrior and one of the few to wield a pretigious Yao-Guai Gauntlet, a symbol that one has undertaken a dangerous quest to aid the tribe."
  WANDERING_WINDS_DESC:0 "Wandering Winds was one of the first tribals to accept the teachings of the Mormons. Sent to New Canaan as a liason, she returned with the word of God and a message of peace, alongside new teachings to lead her people.

  #HAI
  XHUUYAA_DESC:0 "An orphan child, Chief Xhuuyaa never knew his true parents. Instead, Xhuuyaa was raised by the village community he was born into and was thus brough up by those of the Eagle and of the Raven alike. While traditionally a child inherits the moiety of their mother, Xhuuyaa's mother's moiety was unknown, and so the village elders decided Xhuuyaa should live without a moiety, drawing inspiration from both the Eagle and the Raven in equal measure. As a result, Xhuuyaa stood through his young adulthood as a symbol of unity and strength for the Haida people: a natural choice for Chief."

  LOZEN_COLORADAS_DESC:0 "A sharp mind and charismatic speaker, Lozen Coloradas is a proud decendent of the Lipan Apache, one of the three sub-tribes that comprise the Mescalero Nation alongside the Mescalero and Chiricahua Apache.

Unfortunately, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and given little time to live.\nThe news of her impending death had a profound effect on Diana's life. She turned away from science and began to look into the spiritual side of life. However, with so little time left to live, she soon became frustrated and despondent. This was to change when she was contacted by Derek Greenway.\n\nWith Derek's assistance Diana Stone's mind was stored within a ZAX terminal. The change at first was appreciated, yet over time she found herself missing the connection to the world she once had. There, within The Nursery where she was held she heard of Greenway's plan for a certain Vault, Vault 29. The plan was to house a agrarian commune there in the hopes that they would help to restore the wilds of America to what was once before. Diana may have disagreed with Derek's methods -.. yet she couldn't find it in herself to ignore the plight of those within Vault 29.\n\nEventually, she made herself known. Taking control of the vault's ZAX mainframe from afar Diana would become Vault 29's guardian and god, leading them through the chaos of the wasteland and ensuring their safety in these trying times."

Unfortunately for her, the Nevada Ranger seem intent on the final destruction of her warband. She's got a fight on her hands if she wants her grandfather's legacy to live on."
  # ROB
  ROB_Leader_DESC: "In 2068 the holodisk game Doki Doki ( £rob_doki_doki_texticon £rob_doki_doki_texticon ) was released in foreign markets by an American publisher. It was primarily a “dating simulation game” ( A fad at the time of release ) focused around a relationship with the eponymous Doki.\nIn 2077, a terminal in Liberty, Colorado had Doki Doki installed onto it hours before the bombs fell. By the time the game had finished installing humanity had destroyed itself with the game none the wiser.\n\nEventually, ARGOS - a robot serving the warden of Tibbets Prison - would pass through Liberty. ARGOS was drawn to the small terminal, curious of its innocence and desire for connection. He would spend years working with it, upgrading the terminal’s capabilities over time.\n\nWhen ARGOS finally left the terminal for good Doki missed their old friend. The program would use its upgraded processors to look for its lost buddy, reaching out to nearby robots and beseeching aid. These calls for help would lead to a small community of Robots settling in what would become “Robot City”, the terminal's calls guiding them like a moth to the flame."

  Salt_Upon_Wounds_DESC: "The war chief of the White Legs. The worst butcher of them all. The tribes he has crushed are many. The warriors he has slain, countless.  War is  all he knows. Everything he has, everything that tribe has, was taken by force, raiding and scavenging.

As it turned out, she was the first of many: after her, at least two dozen Choristers joined her chained to horrendous machines in a room they knew as The Chapel.

Ever an idealist, Jacobia has long dreamed of reforming the Rotpurgers into a more formal organisation with the chief purpose of erradicating ghouls wherever they may arise.

Due to his importance he, like many other great minds that resided in Spokane, was assigned a spot in Vault 100. One of the first exposed to the radiaton that seeped into Vault 100 under Vault-Tec's orders, Grozdan quickly arose to become one of the leading figures of the ghoulish quater of Vault 100.

Over the decades since his desertion, Billy slowly gained power through advocating for isolationism: in the face of the Bull, it seemed like an honest goal. His old sympathies still hung around him, however: how could Clanton turn away the remnants of the Rangers, as broken as they were? After many sleepless nights he reached a compromise with himself, agreeing to let the Rangers settle down in the Cowboy Country if they agreed not to militarise.

  # ODY
  ODY_Leader_DESC:0 "In the 2040’s the §R“ULYSSES”§! AI research of the company Greenway Hydroponics led to the creation of two artificial intelligences. One, §R"TLALOC"§! would be poised to command Mexico and ensure compliance.\nThe other, §R"ODYSSEUS"§! would be charged with watching and mitigating the spread of the New Plague.\n\nIn the period following the great war ODYSSEUS was tricked by Victor Presper into believing a wide-spread New Plague outbreak had occurred. It would send his robots to rampage across Arizona and Colorado seeking rightful containment of those believed to be carriers, etching fear into the Wasteland as it went. Only a shell remains of its former intelligence remained after a self-inflicted immolation due to falsely believing the New Plague epidemic to be unstoppable.\n\nRecently, Diana Stone has managed to find a backup of ODYSSEUS’s memory core, using it and installing it within the memory-drained ZAX of Boulder Dome in order to bring the fabled intelligence online once again."

While she knows the cultural and economic importance of brahmin to her people – indeed she herself got rich from the sale of milk and meat – Bowen also knows that her Colony cannot survive without fundamental change. She's heard the stories firsthand from those forced to flee Caesar's advancing Legions, and if she cannot convince her people to begin to militarise she fears it will soon be she telling the same story to another poor group of settlers. That can't be allowed to happen."
  # UMB
  AVUERON_DESC:0 "Avueron, son of Sulik and carrier of the Bonespirits, was born in Arroyo and raised in Umbara. While his father was faithful to the spirits that guided the tribe, Sulik also saw sense in teaching his young son about the rest of the world – especially the Chosen One, with whom Sulik adventured for many years. Over the decades since the Chosen One's adventures, the Umbra tribe has slowly opened itself up to the world, trading heavily with Arroyo and the Brotherhood of Steel. When his father passed away in 2262, Avueron chose not to take the \"Grampy Bone\" his father wore for himself: signifying the beginning of Umbra's break from its more primative past. Now Avueron leads Umbra with kindness and compassion, hoping to teach all his people the lessons his father taught him."

  QUINTIN_LOPEZ_DESC:0 "Born to a long line of Tohono O'odham from the Chukut Kuk District, Quintin Lopez has a relatively eventless upbringing. He was taught of his rich ancestoral heritage from a young age, as well as the importance of conservationism and the principles of agriculture, as every child of the Nation is taught. A keen learner of local law, Quintin was a natural choice for a seat on the Legislative Council of the nation, which had met for over four centuries. Eventually he was elected the Nation's chairman, focusing on the importance of agriculture and isolation. While the Tohono O'odham maintain some trade relations from their neighbours, Quintin quietly hopes that if the Nation is to stay quiet enough it just might escape Caesar's warbands..."

Whether or not his citizens will let him live long enough to fulfil these promises is debatable."
  # HUA
  WAUBA_DESC:0 "Wauba's tribe was one of the first absorbed into the Legion, their culture wiped clean by Caesar's men to make them part of his own.

  # BLU

Every attempt at stopping their business was foiled by his ingenuity in creating new methods to smuggle in goods, and with the help of the Paz Bandits it appears that it won't be stopping any time soon. All of the proceeds from smuggling have gone to improve the living standards of the Valle's residents, causing him to enjoy great support from his people. In recent years, however, the NCR has been increasingly aggressive, sending settlers to displace his people.
