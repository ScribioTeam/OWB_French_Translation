  nf_lns.1.t:0 "Silos of the 578th"
  nf_lns.1.d:0 "During the height of the Cold War, the dusty plains around Abilene housed 12 missile silos belonging to the 578th Strategic Missile Squadron. Whilst the missiles were decommissioned long before the turn of the 21st century, the missile silos that they resided in remained Air Force property up until the outbreak of the Great War. As missiles started flying the most senior local commander, Col. Carrie Owens, had a tough decision to make. He had 12 silos, built to survive nuclear detonations and the harsh fallout that would follow them, but far too many important things to put in them. Her men had bunkers, but the local National Guard units did not: saving fighting men would surely help after the apocalypse. Or, Owens could prioritise moving precious resources into the silos, resources that would be invaluable in the future. Or should he allow all citizens who could make it to shelter in the bunkers? Was her duty not to save American lives? With little hesitation, Owen made her decision."
  nf_lns.1.a:0 "The National Guard took priority!"
  nf_lns.1.b:0 "We needed all the stockpile space we could get."
  nf_lns.1.c:0 "Protecting citizens was our first call of duty."
  nf_lns.2.t:0 "What Survived The Apocalypse"
  nf_lns.2.d:0 "Whilst spared a direct hit, Abilene suffered two glancing blows from missiles striking to the North and South-East of the city. Most buildings were flattened by the shockwaves, but more resilient structures in the Dyess AFB and city centre remained standing. The survivors of the blasts, emerging from the missile silos surrounding the city, found themselves greeted with a dead city. They needed a goal, and fast, lest their despair overtook them. Col. Owens once again took the helm, making a tough decision to prioritise one project above all others. The following years would be harsh, and many of those that survived in the missile silos around Abilene would perish from malnutrition, illness or radiation poisoning, including Col. Owens herself. Despite the overwhelming hardships, the principal project Owens pushed for was completed, and it transformed Abilene into shining star of hope across the nuclear wasteland that Texas has become. Indeed, it became the Lone Star. That project was..."
  nf_lns.2.a:0 "Ensuring access to safe food and water for all citizens."
  nf_lns.2.b:0 "Significantly rebuilding Dyess AFB, providing a safe haven for all."
  nf_lns.2.c:0 "The clearing of the I-20, allowing all to reach Lone Star."
  nf_lns.3.t:0 "Mutants Block the I-10"
  nf_lns.3.d:0 "Before the war, there were two great roads into Texas from the south-west: the I-10 and the I-20. Even after the Great War, the two roads remained relatively undamaged, leading to a significant flow of trade and people from the west to Austin along the I-10 and to Dallas along the I-20. As a result, settlements along the two roads began to find their feet again: gradually expanding and rebuilding. That was, until the mutants arrived. Led by the charismatic but twisted Shale, they made their home along the I-10: Shale's hostility to humans ensuring no trade convoys could travel the I-10 until they had moved on. As a result, the I-20 became the only safe and reliable route into both Austin and Dallas. Thanks to this, Lone Star boomed."
  nf_lns.3.a:0 "Our industry expanded to provide for the traders."
  nf_lns.3.b:0 "Trade along the Colorado needed protection too."
  nf_lns.3.c:0 "The markets in our city centre grew bigger than ever."
  nf_lns.4.t:0 "Friendship Across Texas"
  nf_lns.4.d:0 "Whilst Lone Star is without doubt an economic powerhouse, military affairs have never been our strong suit: for the most part, we rely on paramilitary groups and mercenary companies. To our south-east lies the Texan Brotherhood of Steel, who are quite the opposite. The Brotherhood has a strong military, and advanced tactics, but struggles with a sluggish economy. The solution, therefore, seemed fairly natural: the unification of both nations under one economic treaty. Under the original agreement, a 10-year union would cover trade and industrial relations, with Lone Star providing technical know-how to the Brotherhood and the Brotherhood providing military expertise to Lone Star in return. The agreement was ratified by both sides on the turn of the new year in 2265, coming into effect on this day 10 years ago. \n\nWhilst the original agreement was time-limited, there little doubt an extension would be signed once the successes of the agreement became clear. A permanent extension was put before our assembly last week."
  nf_lns.4.a:0 "The extension passed: unanimously!"
  nf_lns.4.b:0 "The extension passed, conditional on greater military advice."
  nf_lns.4.c:0 "The extension passed, but closer than many would have wished..."
  nf_lns.5.t:0 "Lone Star Recalls the Lubbock Expedition"
  nf_lns.5.d:0 "With trouble brewing for them at home, we today received word from [LNS.GetLeader] that the Lubbock Expedition will be returning to Lone Star proper. Their presence has been much welcomed by our military and our people, who will all be saddened to hear that the expedition is returning to Lone Star. [LNS.GetLeader] and Cap. Saunders both assure us this is a temporary move, and they will return in time. We'll see about that."
  nf_lns.5.a:0 "Farewell, friends."
  nf_lns.6.t:0 "A Massacre Outside Leetown: More Than the Hand Gang?"
  nf_lns.6.d:0 "Our garrison at Leetown was awakened early this morning by an exhausted, blood-soaked caravan guard collapsing at their steps in the early hours. On the verge of collapsing, he managed to say a few words to our garrison commander, Cap. Rose Edmund. \n\n\"Ambush... road... massacre...\" \n\nA pause. \n\n\"Hand Gang...\" \n\nEdmund shook her head in disbelief. The Hang Gang? Surely not: they had been mostly wiped out by the Lawmen and Brotherhood special forces long ago, and the survivors weren't capable of an ambush, much less a massacre. Dutifully, however, Edmund gathered up her men and marched to the I-20. The early reports from her scouts were bad, but nothing could prepare her for the sight they were greeted by when they approached the river."
  nf_lns.6.a:0 "The only movement amongst the bodies was a red banner fluttering."
  nf_lns.6.b:0 "The caravan was still just about fighting back."
  nf_lns.7.t:0 "Crisis on the Colorado"
  nf_lns.7.d:0 "For the second time this season, the Leetown garrison has been woken in the early hours by blood-soaked messenger at their perimeter. Whilst she hoped this day would never come, Cap. Edmund is no fool, and had been making preparations for another massive engagement with a hostile voice, and so sprung into action. This time, however, the attack had not come a caravan on the I-20, but instead on a large convoy following the Colorado south-east to Austin. Edmund's troops marched as fast as they could to reach the battle site, but by the time her garrison arrived the attacking force was long gone. Instead, all that was left was burnt out caravans and canoes, with hundreds of bodies littering the ground. This was a tragedy of even greater proportions than the last attack: these attackers were efficient, merciless and able to strike across a large area. Something sinister must be at work, for this kind of attack is far beyond the Hand Gang."
  nf_lns.7.a:0 "Double our river patrols. This must not happen again!"
  nf_lns.7.b:0 "Their next attack will surely come on the I-20."
  nf_lns.7.c:0 "Our settlements could be next. Expand the garrisons!"
  nf_lns.8.t:0 "Legionaries in Lone Star"
  nf_lns.8.d:0 "Whilst our leadership in Lone Star has naturally been aware of the disturbing attacks around Leetown over the past 4 months, nobody could have been prepared for the news the Lawmen brought [LNS.GetLeader] today. According to their men on the streets of Lone Star, two Legionaries were spotted walking into an alleyway in one of poorer districts of the city. Whilst unconfirmed by more than a handful of witnesses, Legionaries haven't been seen around Lone Star since the Legion's scavenging mission to the area more than a decade ago. Even during the expedition, the group stayed far away from the city, making this sighting even more bizarre. \n\nIf it weren't for the attacks around Leetown over the past months, we'd be able to discount this report with ease. However, the more we think about it, the more it seems to make sense. The coordination of the attacks, the brutality, the expertise. If Legionaries are at play, the risk is far greater than any of us could have imagined."
  nf_lns.8.a:0 "Find these Legionaries: now!"
  nf_lns.8.b:0 "Assign units to protect our industry everywhere."
  nf_lns.8.c:0 "The Lawmen must be hallucinating. Surely."
  nf_lns.9.t:0 "Fighting on the Streets of Lone Star"
  nf_lns.9.d:0 "No matter what we all hoped, we all knew deep down that this day would come. Starting in the northern outskirts of Lone Star, skirmishes have started breaking out across the city between the Lawmen and Hand Warband insurgents. At first limited in scope and length, ever more clashes are sparking as it is become clear the Lawmen alone are ill prepared to deal with the insurgency. Whilst the attacks are nowhere near total war, they have the possibility to evolve into it: and fast. Based on the current situation, fighting will probably reach the central districts within two to three days. We need to take action to prevent this. Or God help us all."
  nf_lns.9.a:0 "Divert all units. The uprising must be crushed."
  nf_lns.9.b:0 "This will spread. Defend all our settlements."
  nf_lns.9.c:0 "Empower the Lawmen to deal with this crisis."
  nf_lns.10.t:0 "The Uprising Spreads!"
  nf_lns.10.d:0 "We hoped that the bulk of the Hand Warband's forces were being used in the assault on Lone Star, but that appears far from the case. In the far north and far south of our territory, we have received reports of local garrisons being besieged by invading warbands. If Leetown and Haskell have not yet fallen, they will soon: especially Haskell to the north, where it appears a Legion division has joint the attack on the local garrison. Even graver news comes from the north of Lone Star itself, where fresh enemy divisions have been sighted preparing an all-out attack on our capital. \n\nIn response to this threat, the Lawmen have mobilised themselves into military-style divisions, and all mercenary divisions have been put on full alert. It seems we have a fight on our hand, pals. We better give it our all."
  nf_lns.10.a:0 "Send word to the Brotherhood. We need help here."
  nf_lns.10.b:0 "Ave! True to Caesar..."
  nf_lns.11.t:0 "The Old Order Triumphant"
  nf_lns.11.d:0 "With the last pockets of the Hand Warband being eliminated as we speak, it seems all but certain that we have survived the insurgency of the warband and their legion allies. Fortunately, Legion involvement was limited, and not a full-scale invasion as we first feared: it appears instead that the groups were remnants of the Legion scavenging group sent into Texas over a decade ago, who remained behind to attempt to take over and woe Caesar's favour. Certainly if they had succeeded it would have been a master-stroke, granting the Legion a base deep in Texas. However, they fortunately failed. Decisively, at that. \n\nMuch is left to do, however. We've had to make extensive diplomatic and economic concessions to win against the warband, and we will need time to recover again. Moreover, we still have our plans for developing the Texan Economic Union to deal with. Exciting times lay ahead!"
  nf_lns.11.a:0 "Forwards we go, stronger than before."
  nf_lns.12.t:0 "A New Warlord on the I-20"
  nf_lns.12.d:0 "The last pockets of those loyal to Bang and the old order are currently being eradicated as we speak, and so it appears we have at last managed to seize control of the country from the stuffy traditionalists that refused to recognise our true master: Caesar. Now that we have control of most of the nation, we can go about implementing our program. Much is needed to be done before we can reach out to Caesar and rejoin the Legion, however. The economy has suffered much as a result of the civil war, and our army is nothing befitting of a Legion. We also need to deal with the pesky rangers to our east, as well as safeguard Lone Star from any other attacks. We must get to work, for Caesar!"
  nf_lns.12.a:0 "Caesar wills it, and so it will be done."
  nf_lns.13.t:0 "The Lubbock Expedition Returns"
  nf_lns.13.d:0 "Following the conclusion of the civil war in Lone Star, and the relative stability that has returned to the troubled state, Lone Star has offered to reestablish the so-called \"Lubbock Expedition\". This group, led by the veteran Col. Aaron Sauders, has been greatly beneficial to our stability and military capacity when they were stationed in our nation in the past. Surely should we allow the troops to return once more we can expect these benefits to return. However, we have reason to think Lone Star's motives may not be purely protection: Lone Star may use these troops to exert leverage against us in the future. We have a difficult decision to make."
  nf_lns.13.a:0 "They're more than welcome here."
  nf_lns.13.b:0 "Turn them away, we can't risk foreign troops."
  nf_lns.14.t:0 "Lubbock Welcomes Our Expedition"
  nf_lns.14.d:0 "Lubbock has accepted our offer to reestablish the so-called \"Lubbock Expedition\". The troops that used to compose this detachment are now taking up positions in Lubbock, led by the veteran Col. Aaron Saunders. This will surely lead to greater ties in the future!"
  nf_lns.14.a:0 "Excellent!"
  nf_lns.15.t:0 "Lubbock Refuses Our Expedition"
  nf_lns.15.d:0 "After much deliberation, Lubbock has decided to decline our offer to reinstate the so-called \"Lubbock Expedition\". This means they will no longer have our support in war and in peace, and our troops will not be able to freely move in Lubbock territory without sparking a war. On the plus side, this now means the veteran troops from the expedition can now be integrated into our army, alongside Col. Saunders."
  nf_lns.15.a:0 "Truly their loss."
  nf_lns.16.t:0 "We Dare to Dream"
  nf_lns.16.d:0 "Two decades ago, Texas was a fractured and chaotic mess of raiders, slavers, traders and mutants. Then, things changed. Together, Lone Star and [TBH.GetNameDef] signed the Texan Economic Union. Mutually beneficial to both, the Union ushered in two decades of economic growth in both nations. Lone Star thrived as trade along the I-20 boomed, and [TBH.GetNameDef] expanded to protect yet more settlements. Together, the two brought stability and wealth to the central and south-eastern regions of the old Texan Commonwealth. As a result, a previously ridiculous idea has left the realm of insanity and joined the realm of possibility. That idea? A new Texan Republic. By combining the economic power of Lone Star with the military and peacekeeping prowess of [TBH.GetNameDef], we could bring stability to the Texan wastelands previously unheard of. For the good of our people, we owe them to try."
  nf_lns.16.a:0 "Forwards, together!"
  nf_lns.17.t:0 "Integration of the I-20"
  nf_lns.17.d:0 "Maybe we knew this day would come. Maybe we should have been expecting it. Nevertheless, the communique Cap. Saunders brought us today came as a surprise to the entire government. The government in Lone Star, emboldened by the dream of reforming a Texan Republic, has demanded we submit to annexation under their leadership, until such a time as a provisional Congress can be established for the new Republic. If we refuse, [LNS.GetLeader] has promised swift military action: both an invasion from the east, and the so-called \"Lubbock Expedition\" moving swiftly to conquer our capital. We have a tough decision to make."
  nf_lns.17.a:0 "We will be safer as one."
  nf_lns.17.b:0 "We can't compromise our autonomy."
  nf_lns.18.t:0 "Lubbock Accepts Annexation"
  nf_lns.18.d:0 "In the face of overwhelming odds against them, the government of Lubbock has accepted our demands of annexation and integration. Command of Lubbock troops has been transferred to Cap. Saunders, who has established a temporary military government in Lubbock until or troops can take complete control of the area. We can now be certain our traders will be able to access the I-20 forever more, and so we can press on with our efforts to reform Texas!"
  nf_lns.18.a:0 "Diplomacy wins again."
  nf_lns.19.t:0 "Lubbock Resists Integration"
  nf_lns.19.d:0 "Despite the best diplomatic efforts of Cap. Saunders and the intimidation of the Lubbock Expedition, the leadership of Lubbock has refused our offer of integration into our trade empire. Fortunately, we have other means of perusing our interests."
  nf_lns.19.a:0 "This could have been so simple."
  nf_lns.20.t:0 "The I-10 Gambit"
  nf_lns.20.d:0 "A delegation has arrived at our capital today from [LNS.GetLeader] of [LNS.GetName] himself, seeking to open negotiations about the access of traders to the I-10. They offer economic aid and \"more than adequate compensation\" in exchange for exclusive rights to control those who can trade on the I-10. Whilst the deal probably makes economic sense, allowing Lone Star troops into the heart of our land would be incredibly dangerous should we wind up at war with them. Plus, can they be trusted to keep up their side of the bargain?"
  nf_lns.20.a:0 "Accept their offer."
  nf_lns.20.b:0 "It's too dangerous!"
  nf_lns.21.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Accepts"
  nf_lns.21.d:0 "It was certainly a risk, but [FROM.GetName]'s weak response makes it all worth it."
  nf_lns.21.a:0 "Our gamble paid off."
  nf_lns.22.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refuses"
  nf_lns.22.d:0 "It seems that our willingness to push forward 'at all costs' will now be put to the test. [FROM.GetName] has refused our offer, which now places pressure on our response."
  nf_lns.22.a:0 "We must achieve our goals."
  nf_lns.23.t:0 "Unity Awaits"
  nf_lns.23.d:0 "Our Texan brothers have reached out to us and offered unification. This has been our grandest dream since near our inception and the fires of the Great War. So why wait? Why cling, gasping and struggling, to the last vestiges of a self-defeating independence? Let us forge a new future together, for ourselves and all of Texas."
  nf_lns.23.a:0 "Together, we will make our plans!"
  nf_lns.24.t:0 "The Texan Stronghold"
  nf_lns.24.d:0 "Caesar is a genius man. With little apparent hope of success, his agents and recruits did the impossible. Lone Star is now a home of proud legionaires, swearing loyalty to him and him alone. But the best is yet to come. We have a role in the Legion's greater plans, and why deny the Fates their due?"
  nf_lns.24.a:0 "By Caesar's Will!"
  nf_lns.25.t:0 "A Hostile Expedition"
  nf_lns.25.d:0 "Our hostile Hand neighbors have sent a punitive expedition against us! We must act quickly if we have any hope of survival against what is no doubt a coming onslaught."
  nf_lns.25.a:0 "Send our army to meet the expedition!"
  nf_lns.25.b:0 "We will be safer under their rule..."
  nf_lns.26.t:0 "A Friend Up North"
  nf_lns.26.d:0 "An delegation has reached us from the Hand Warband to our north. They present a deal to us: one they believe is mutually beneficial for both sides. The deal proposes a temporary military alliance between our two parties with the aim of carving up the mutant lands of Shale's Army and Eden between the two of us. They would conquer the lands once belonging to Shale's Army, and in exchange we would gain the lands of Eden. To sweeten the deal, they also offer a substantial lot of iron for us to do what we will with. How should we respond?"
  nf_lns.26.a:0 "Accept their deal."
  nf_lns.26.b:0 "Their words mean nothing!"
  nf_lns.27.t:0 "[IMO.GetName] Accepts Our Deal"
  nf_lns.27.d:0 "After relatively swift negotiations, [IMO.GetNameDef] have agreed to our deal to carve up the lands to our south between our two nations. They have pledged their support in our upcoming wars to conquer the area!"
  nf_lns.27.a:0 "Wonderful!"
  nf_lns.28.t:0 "[IMO.GetName] Refuses Our Deal"
  nf_lns.28.d:0 "Despite our best attempts to sweeten the deal proposed, [IMO.GetNameDef] have refused to ally with us against the threats to our south. We shall have to focus on the I-10 alone."
  nf_lns.28.a:0 "A shame..."
  nf_lns.29.t:0 "Life Is Peaceful There!"
  nf_lns.29.d:0 "Our resurgence was founded on one core principle: an undying devotion to the values Caesar and his Legion hold dear. Through years of civil war, reform, purges and blood we have finally managed to solidify our position as a dominant power in Texas, and as the Legion's Eastern stronghold. Once this was complete, our mission was to sit tight and wait for the Legion's Texan invasion. That invasion has yet to properly reach our borders. As such, we must take it upon ourselves to venture west, towards Red Sun City. There, we shall either meet the Legion's border patrols, or find out what became of the mighty Legion..."
  nf_lns.29.a:0 "Together, we will make our plans!"

  nf_lns.32.t:0 "A Bird in the Hand"
  nf_lns.32.d:0 "The city of Lonestar has been taken over by a band of raiders. Although they will be no threat to us, why not send them weapons to fight the Brotherhood wish? This honestly costs us nothing."
  nf_lns.32.a:0 "Together, we will make our plans!"
  nf_lns.32.b:0 "We're Busy, sorry."

  nf_lns.33.t:0 "Hecho En Mexico!"
  nf_lns.33.d:0 "Santa Anna was kind enough to send us antitank equipment to use against the Brotherhood. And perhaps against him, if he gets uppity..."
  nf_lns.33.a:0 "What's he going to do, attack a divided Texas?"
