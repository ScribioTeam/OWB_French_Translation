  blimp_equipment_4_desc:0 "Carte Blanche was given to our engineers in terms of budget to improve our blimps, and while embezzlement rumours have been going around, they are indeed just that. Rumours. With all the autocannons increased in calibre and given gun-laying radars, along with mortar upgraded to low-velocity howitzers, few can stand against our might. With the armour of a tank and a reinforced nano-Kevlar balloon with internal bulkheads and emergency air pumps, nothing can stand in it's way."

Four stabilizer fins attached to it ensure a stable trajectory and prevent tumbling in flight, increasing accuracy (a necessary feature, as the projectile is not spin-stabilized). The hemisphere core is screwed onto the top, containing the nuclear core. Finally, the weapon is fitted with a beryllium contact fuse that starts the nuclear reaction on impact."
