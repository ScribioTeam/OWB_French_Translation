With the possibility of carrying hand-thrown shells, heavy machine guns for anti-aircraft fire and even high-explosive bombs, such an asset can dominate the sky. With a single tail-mounted propeller engine providing thrust, it cannot move swiftly. It can, however, provide fire support in an enormous range around it's launching point."

Rudimentary air radars, along with gun-laying devices, also increases our anti-air capabilities. And for anyone thinking they can outrun it, an autocannon turret placed at the bottom of the gondola will quickly bring them down. Tactical speed is also increased by the addition of two turboprop engine."
