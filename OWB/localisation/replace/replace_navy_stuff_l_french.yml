  ship_hull_medium:0 "Medium Ship Hulls"

  ship_hull_light_1:0 "Canoe Hull"
  ship_hull_light_1_desc:0 "A simple, wooden, lightweight, and narrow vessel, this dugout canoe will let a fire team participate in skirmishing engagements from afar, with swivel mounts as provision for armament."
  ship_hull_light_2:0 "Cutter Hull"
  ship_hull_light_2_desc:0 "Advances in ship building have resulted in this new cutter design, more sturdy from the use of a wood strip manufacturing method, and equipped with a better hand-swivelled mount for weaponry."
  ship_hull_light_3:0 "Tug Boat Hull"
  ship_hull_light_3_desc:0 "Tugboat designs scavenged from sea-side ports and naval infrastructures can be rebuilt into efficient military vessels, with enough space to both mount heavier weaponry, have a full squad on-board, and stock more supplies during patrol duty."
  ship_hull_light_4:0 "Patrol Boat Hull"
  ship_hull_light_4_desc:0 "Specially-built patrol boats, designed for speed and agility both in river patrols and open combat, feature a powered mount for armament and dedicated internal spaces for engine, ammunition and water pumps."
  ship_hull_light_5:0 "Torpedo Boat Hull"
  ship_hull_light_5_desc:0 "With a reinforced hold and rear section able to receive a swiveling torpedo launcher, those modified PT boats also fit the previous powered mount in bulletproof glass turrets, powered by the internal engine. The additional space even allows a platoon to staff those fast skirmishers."

  ship_hull_medium_1:0 "Longboat Hull"
  ship_hull_medium_1_desc:0 "An open-top, wooden boat with provisions to transport a full squad, those early ships constitute our medium option in term of naval assets. Suited to second-line engagements, they can probably fight on the frontline in a pinch."
  ship_hull_medium_2:0 "Schooner Hull"
  ship_hull_medium_2_desc:0 "Wooden vessels built to specification in the 50 tonnage range, those reinforced crafts can carry a full squad to help man the various gun mounts, water pumps, or defend against boarding with a compliment of sidearms."
  ship_hull_medium_3:0 "River Barge"
  ship_hull_medium_3_desc:0 "With actual below-deck accommodations for the crew, this barge allows our troops to stay in patrol much longer, and benefit from increased comfort. Made of a fibreglass material with wooden structure, they are still primarily converted civilian vessels."
  ship_hull_medium_4:0 "Combat Barge"
  ship_hull_medium_4_desc:0 "Semi-displacing hulls made of an all-steel construction, those battle barge boast armored turrets and protected bulkheads to reinforce their internal structures."
  ship_hull_medium_5:0 "Assault Craft"
  ship_hull_medium_5_desc:0 "High-speed yet heavily armed, those hulls are specially made with a composite backing for exceptional stiffness and good agility. Internal electronics as well as connected weapon mounts improves their overall firepower as well."

  ship_hull_heavy_1:0 "Trireme"
  ship_hull_heavy_1_desc:0 "A massive wooden hull suited for frontline combat, the trireme embarks a full compliment of reinforced mounts for naval armaments, as well as battle platoon ready for combat. Slow and steady, these heavy-class ships are perfect for first-line combat"
  ship_hull_heavy_2:0 "Brig"
  ship_hull_heavy_2_desc:0 "Heavily reinforced wooden ship in the 450 tonnage range, those impressive vessels need a massive keel to support the internal backing alone. Once fitted with weaponry and additional armor, they are more than a match for most other vessels."
  ship_hull_heavy_3:0 "Paddle Steamer"
  ship_hull_heavy_3_desc:0 "Ironclad steamers with armored paddle wheels, these huge vessels have roomy and sealed armored turrets to install naval guns in, as well as multiple weapon mounts for AA or anti-skirmishing duties."
  ship_hull_heavy_4:0 "Battle Barge"
  ship_hull_heavy_4_desc:0 "Staffed by a full-strength troop, those armoured battle barges have high-visibility gun turrets and smaller, reinforced AA turrets, as well as double-layered deck to protect against aerial assaults and plunging fire."
  ship_hull_heavy_5:0 "Floating Fortress"
  ship_hull_heavy_5_desc:0 "Huge vessels staffed by an entire company, they represent the heaviest naval asset we could ever hope to manufacture. They use the latest ship-laying techniques, as well as damage analysis from previous battles to reinforce key structural weakpoints."

  ship_hull_super_heavy_1:0 "Refurbished Tanker"
  ship_hull_super_heavy_1_desc:0 "The largest vessel to ever set sail in the wasteland, those six hundred feet long, pre-war tankers have been refurbished with mountains of armament and armor, making them naval behemoths that barely anyone could ever hope to take down."
