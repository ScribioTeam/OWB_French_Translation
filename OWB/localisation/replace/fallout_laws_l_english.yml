  ncr_four_year_conscription_desc:0 "Extending the conscription to a four year rotation will considerably increase our available manpower, but with it comes consequences. Massive funding has to be allocated to train conscripts to a decent standard for our army, and moral is slowly degrading even if our citizens understand our situation. We must be careful if we are to go further."

Are we to leave ourselves perish, are we not to rage against our fate until the bitter end? Already, the forced conscriptions and training leave kind-hearted people into empty shells. Our nation might never forgive us. Our citizens will hate us, our officers will resent us, and our culture might never recover fully. But it is all worth it if only to leave a hateful nation standing. Damned be the wasteland for leaving us no choice, and damned be our souls for going down this path. War truly never changes."
