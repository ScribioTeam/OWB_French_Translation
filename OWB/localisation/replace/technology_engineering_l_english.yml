  electronic_engineering:0 "Ohm's Law"
  electronic_engineering_desc:0 "Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. It is quintessential for anything remotely related to electricity."
  electronic_engineering_1:0 "Resistor"
  electronic_engineering_1_desc:0 "A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses. High-power resistors that can dissipate many watts of electrical power as heat, may be used as part of motor controls, in power distribution systems, or as test loads for generators."
  electronic_engineering_2:0 "Vacuum Tubes"
  electronic_engineering_2_desc:0 "A vacuum tube, an electron tube, is a device that controls electric current between electrodes in an evacuated container. Vacuum tubes mostly rely on thermionic emission of electrons from a hot filament or a heated cathode. This type is called a thermionic tube or thermionic valve. A photo-tube, however, achieves electron emission through the photoelectric effect. "
  electronic_engineering_3:0 "Simple Circuitry"
  electronic_engineering_3_desc:0 "An electronic circuit is composed of individual electronic components, such as resistors, vacuum tubes, capacitors, inductors and diodes, connected by conductive wires or traces through which electric current can flow."
  electronic_engineering_4:0 "Complicated Circuitry"
  electronic_engineering_4_desc:0 "The combination of components and wires allows various simple and complex operations to be performed: signals can be amplified, computations can be performed, and data can be moved from one place to another."
  electronic_engineering_5:0 "Miniaturized Circuitry"
  electronic_engineering_5_desc:0 "Miniaturization is the trend to manufacture ever smaller mechanical, optical and electronic products and devices. With the ability to store ever more hardware power in less and less space, computers have drastically reduced in scale."
  electronic_engineering_6:0 "Advanced Circuitry"
  electronic_engineering_6_desc:0 "The Pip-Boy 2000 displays information in bright green on its black 5\" x 3\" screen, can record sound and video footage for later playback, and uses a simple yet elegant form of sonar and satellite tracking where satellite coverage is available to map out areas where its user travels. Though input is slow, a user can also hand-enter and edit text messages on the Pip-Boy 2000. Also available in gold, white and blue."
  electronic_engineering_7:0 "ZAX Technology"
  electronic_engineering_7_desc:0 "Developed by Vault-Tec, ZAX is a series of advanced supercomputers capable of learning, independent thought and creativity, with added error insertion to improve its variance in experience and learning capability. ZAX 1.0, the original prototype, went online in 2054. Initially a prototype of some of the systems designed to govern the Vaults, it was given to the federal government to help the Department of Energy collect resource data. Within a year, it was taken by the American military for plague and tactical research."
  encryption:0 "Secret Language"
  encryption_desc:0 "With orders frequently yelled across the battlefield, it's very easy for the enemy to predict movements or distinguish orders. To counteract this effect, we will give a manual to every officer and troop, covering common orders that can be swapped for other words and military terminology, meant to confuse and distract our opponents."
  encryption_1:0 "Encoded Signals"
  encryption_1_desc:0 "To secure our communication further, we will provide encoding signals on a bi-weekly basis. Changing our encryption so frequently requires efforts in flexible decryption training and manual manufacturing, but the added security is more than worth it."
  encryption_2:0 "Polyalphabetic Ciphers"
  encryption_2_desc:0 "By using random alphabetic ciphers, we can considerably improve our radio transmission security. With each letter of a transmission replaced by another one, each time chosen from multiple alphabetic substitution tables, this system provides significantly lessened chances of code cracking without access to the actual ciphers or decryption machines."
  encryption_3:0 "Pulse-Code Modulation"
  encryption_3_desc:0 "Rapid switching of transmission frequencies, coupled with distraction modules sending garbage intel on multiple channel spectrum, let our signal personnel operate with little chance of enemy breakthrough. Radios able to decipher such swift frequency changes are second to none, letting us manufacture the only model able to do so."
  encryption_4:0 "Digital Encryption"
  encryption_4_desc:0 "Random-algorithm encryption programs are the peak of what our researchers can provide us in terms of encryption technology. With constant binary fluctuations of internal data, any transmission intercepted by the enemy is as liable to be a garbled mess as to utterly fry their equipment from information overload."
  decryption:0 "Reference Manual"
  decryption_desc:0 "As we manage to capture more enemies, and gather more information about their command structure, we can provide a simple résumé of our findings. Common keywords used as orders, along with preferred tactics and strategy during battle, will let our officers and soldiers anticipate enemy manoeuvres."
  decryption_1:0 "Decode Signals"
  decryption_1_desc:0 "Advanced decryption is the key to manipulate the battlefield to our advantage and predict the movements of enemy troops. As such, rear-line hunting parties are armed with pistols and explosives, tasked with raiding enemy command structures and communication outpost for any intel available or even to capture enemy personnel."
  decryption_2:0 "Frequency Analysis"
  decryption_2_desc:0 "As more unknown cyphers are encountered, we cannot hope to crack them on guessing alone. Bringing in decryption specialists equipped with radio frequency sweepers will yield impressive result. Common cyphers can also frequently be cracked by applying common language keywords, such as the Etaoin shroud method."
  decryption_3:0 "Side-Channel Attack"
  decryption_3_desc:0 "Main channels are often difficult to crack, but by bypassing them and alternatively cracking the hardware we can completely bypass intel ciphers. Instead of looking at the message itself, we can study the time taken to execute cryptographic algorithms, letting us discern the delay each decryption input takes to be processed. This allows us to gain access directly to the final message, instead of having to do the cracking ourselves."
  decryption_4:0 "Digital Decryption"
  decryption_4_desc:0 "While random algorithm encryption and advanced cyphers are becoming more and more common, our enemies have forgot one thing. That decryption isn't everything in intel warfare. Broad-spectrum and otherwise multi-frequency jammers set up around expected areas of operations can make messages incomplete, or even missing entirely, forcing our enemies to switch to backup methods which are much easier to track and intercept."
  communication_engineering:0 "Combat Language"
  communication_engineering_desc:0 "To ensure proper communication, be it in the middle of a melee or a bombardment, our soldiers have taken to distinctive hand gestures with different meanings. Standardizing these techniques should improve intelligence transmission, and provide a base upon which to build our intel network."
  communication_engineering_1:0 "Smoke Signals"
  communication_engineering_1_desc:0 "Smoke signals used as rudimentary communication is a good way to project orders across a battlefield. Of course, old camps with stone fire won't be enough. Trained signal personnel will man a rear-line outpost, using a campfire with flamer fuel and coloured smoke, will be required to have orders be seen across the blasted battlefield."
  communication_engineering_2:0 "Primitive Radio"
  communication_engineering_2_desc:0 "The discovery of multiple so called "ham radio" magazines have provided very useful blueprints to our scientists to build primitive version of these devices, able to supplement our existing system with a long-range alternative, allowing better strategical communication."
  communication_engineering_3:0 "Radio"
  communication_engineering_3_desc:0 "Advances in radio manufacturing allow increased range, miniaturization, decreased power draw and most importantly, the ability to install automatic encryption or decryption devices. It is a considerably important tool, and as such only the most dedicated of specialists can operate it."
  communication_engineering_4:0 "Long Range Radio"
  communication_engineering_4_desc:0 "An interconnected network of backpack military radio, combined with mobile antennas installed in rear-line outposts, will let our command staff become quickly aware of any developing situations and able to rapidly send reinforcements to any hotspot."
  communication_engineering_5:0 "Digital data Links"
  communication_engineering_5_desc:0 "Centralized command networks and military outposts are now equipped with state of the art data uplink, connected to our soldier's helmet HUD, and allowing any of them to quickly access the situation even while under fire. Such technology is a tremendous progress in intel gathering equipment, which will also allow better communication between our laboratories."

  radio_detection:0 "Radio Detection"
  radio_detection_desc:0 "RADAR, the transmission and interception of radio waves, can also be harnessed in the field of military detection technology. Phased arrays sending continuous waves can quickly detect any changes in their pattern, such as stoppage or reflection upon an aircraft's frame, or a ship's hull."
  decimetric_radar:0 "Decimetric Radar"
  decimetric_radar_desc:0 "Using an improved phased array of multiple transmission antenna can allow us to more precisely detect airborne or seaborne objects, using the same techniques coincidence rangefinders use at a much higher frequency. Decimetric wavelength allow increased precision and more frequent sweeping, allowing accurate tracking."
  improved_decimetric_radar:0 "Improved Decimetric Radar"
  improved_decimetric_radar_desc:0 "Fitting our decimetric wavelength radars with improved polarization filters can significantly decrease false positives, as well as eliminate natural interference found typically when the main array is engaged. Combined, this let our crew react more quickly to approaching threat without the need for multiple confirmations."
  centimetric_radar:0 "Centimetric Radar"
  centimetric_radar_desc:0 "Research into centimetric wavelength arrays can help us correct the many flaws of the old decimetric system, namely by allowing more precise pulse sweeping as well as increased range from the wavelength's sensitive signal. This also paves the way for further research into countermeasure preventions."
  improved_centimetric_radar:0 "Improved Centimetric Radar"
  improved_centimetric_radar_desc:0 "Further refinement of our polarization filters let us counteract the effect of almost any interference, along with significantly improving our ability to withstand radar jamming or countermeasures. Coupled with better power draw, increased reliability and efficiency, it makes them able to spot almost any threat."
  advanced_centimetric_radar:0 "Advanced Centimetric Radar"
  advanced_centimetric_radar_desc:0 "Integrating limited modulation abilities into our radar array allows them to continuously modify their pulse duration as well as frequency. With such broad-range scanning and transmission, the enemy is incapable of effectively jamming our detection systems, giving us an incredible edge over their countermeasure systems."
