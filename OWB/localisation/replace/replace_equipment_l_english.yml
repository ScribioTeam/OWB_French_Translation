  fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "Our engineers have, after multiple stressful tests, invented a glider able to strike from the sky. Armed with two sub-machineguns, a compliment of grenades for ground strikes, and a lot of prayers, our pilots can now support frontline troops. A mobile catapult system, installed on a truck bed for launching procedures, also gives them a considerably increased range, as the trucks have more autonomy than our gliders."

  fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "As speed and low drag become primordial, a monoplane design is now preferable. Increased weight capacity allows the installation of a third, air-cooled, higher calibre machine-gun for gun runs, as well as external struts able to support two 100lb high explosive bombs. Stacked powerpack units allow higher top speed, giving us the possibility for increased strike range, and interception techniques against enemy crafts."
