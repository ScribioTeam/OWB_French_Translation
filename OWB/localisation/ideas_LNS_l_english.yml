  # Early Ideas
  LNS_idea_hand_gang_resurgence:0 "A Hand Gang Resurgence?"
  LNS_idea_hand_gang_resurgence_desc:0 "Whilst the Hand Gang has long since been crushed, their members spread across our lands and beyond. We dismissed splinters as harmless, but it seems recently these splinters have gained some form of central coordination. Emboldened, they have begun attacking our outposts and settlements. The situation threatens to get out of hand: and fast."
  LNS_idea_fatigued_lawmen:0 "Fatigued Lawmen"
  LNS_idea_fatigued_lawmen_desc:0 "Once the peacekeepers of our streets, the Lawmen have fought many battles for the greater good. Sadly, the Lawmen seem to need to be called out ever more frequently, and they're starting to feel the strain. "
  LNS_idea_controllers_of_the_I20:0 "Control of the I-20"
  LNS_idea_controllers_of_the_I20_desc:0 "Now that Shale's Mutant Army occupies the I-10, the I-20 is the only safe road for traders to enter Texas through. As a result, it has become a thriving trade route, and our precious Lone Star is the beating heart of it all. All trade must flow on the I-20, and so all trade must flow through Lone Star: bringing with it all manner of exotic goods and rare artifacts."
  LNS_idea_tbh_advisors:0 "Brotherhood Military Advisors"
  LNS_idea_tbh_advisors_desc:0 "As part of the Texan Economic Union, the Brotherhood provides us with some military experts to help us improve and upgrade our military. Their help has been invaluable over the last decade, leading to the successful establishment of both the I-20 Patrolmen and the Rapid Response Corp. More is surely to come. \n\n§GSo long as this clause in the §YTexan Economic Union§! remains active, we shall have access to special §YBrotherhood§! advisors.§!"
  LNS_idea_tbh_advisors_strong:0 "Brotherhood Military Advisors"
  LNS_idea_tbh_advisors_desc_strong:0 "As part of the Texan Economic Union, the Brotherhood provides us with some military experts to help us improve and upgrade our military. Their help has been invaluable over the last decade, leading to the successful establishment of both the I-20 Patrolmen and the Rapid Response Corp. More is surely to come. \n\n§GSo long as this clause in the §YTexan Economic Union§! remains active, we shall have access to special §YBrotherhood§! advisors.§!"
  LNS_idea_tbh_advisors_strong_basic_drills:0 "Brotherhood Military Advisors"
  LNS_idea_tbh_advisors_strong_basic_drills_desc:0 "Needs Loc"
  LNS_idea_tbh_advisors_strong_advanced_drills:0 "Brotherhood Military Advisors"
  LNS_idea_tbh_advisors_strong_advanced_drills_desc:0 "Needs Loc"
  LNS_idea_lubbock_expedition:0 "The Lubbock Expedition"
  LNS_idea_lubbock_expedition_desc:0 "Although primarily sent west to patrol the I-20, the so-called \"§YLubbock Expedition§!\" from Lone Star has benefitted us in other ways than mere protection. Lone Star units have improved our knowledge of military affairs, and have prove to be reliable mediators between the ghoul and human sectors of Lubbock itself. \n\n§GSo long as the §YLubbock Expedition§! remains in our lands, we shall provide Lone Star military access and receive a guarantee, units and an expeditionary general in return.§!"
  LNS_idea_empowered_lawmen:0 "Empowered Lawmen"
  LNS_idea_empowered_lawmen_desc:0 "Following the breakout of sporadic fighting on the streets of Lone Star, we have authorised the Lawmen to use all means necessary to restore the peace. Only time will tell if they are successful."
  LNS_idea_warlord_rises:0 "A Warlord Rises?"
  LNS_idea_warlord_rises_desc:0 "The recent attacks outside of Leetown were far too coordinated and brutal to be orchestrated by stray Hand Gang remnants. Our latest working theory is there is some kind of warlord acting in the south, intent on raiding traders."
  LNS_idea_foreign_player:0 "A Foreign Attack?"
  LNS_idea_foreign_player_desc:0 "A second attack outside Leetown, this time more brutal and efficient than the last. We must be dealing with someone with excellent military expertise here: this is no mere local warlord."
  LNS_idea_caesars_hand:0 "Legionaries Pull The Strings!"
  LNS_idea_caesars_hand_desc:0 "Following sightings of Legionaries in Lone Star itself, it seems that we have the solution to our conundrum. The Hand Gang has unified under some legate of the Legion, and is intent on either toppling or destabilizing our government. We will have to wait for their next move."
  LNS_idea_west_in_flames:0 "Revolts in the West"
  LNS_idea_west_in_flames_desc:0 "Whilst we've managed to defeat the majority of insurgent forces, the Hand Gang has retreated back to the desolate territory in our West and North that it used to call its home. We'll need a concentrated political and military campaign to dislodge them."
  LNS_idea_east_in_flames:0 "East in Flames"
  LNS_idea_east_in_flames_desc:0 "Whilst the Hand Gang has long since been driven from our eastern lands, they've caused devastation to our lands that will take time to fix. In the mean time, our economy suffers."
  LNS_idea_i10_controller_deal:0 "Trading Away the I-10"
  LNS_idea_i10_controller_deal_desc:0 "Following intensive negotiations with the leadership of [LNS.GetName], we have agreed a treaty to grant [LNS.GetNameDef] sole dominance of the trade on the I-10. In exchange, we benefit economically and through technological knowledge. The deal is obviously null and void if we wind up at war with Lone Star or lose control of the I-10."
  LNS_idea_i10_lns_deal:0 "Control of the I-10"
  LNS_idea_i10_lns_deal_desc:0 "Following successful negotiations with the Fort Stockton leadership, we have agreed to an economic deal in which we gain sole right to determine who can pass on the I-10 in exchange for some economic aid."
  LNS_idea_controllers_of_the_I10:0 "Control of the I-10"
  LNS_idea_controllers_of_the_I10_desc:0 "Following successful negotiations with the Fort Stockton leadership, we have agreed to an economic deal in which we gain sole right to determine who can pass on the I-10 in exchange for some economic aid. Our dominance and expansion of the road has led to untold wealth."
  ## Manpower Laws
  lns_mercenary_approach:0 "Complete Mercenary Forces"
  lns_mercenary_approach_desc:0 "If we were to completely base our military around mercenaries, we would not be risking our men in foreign wars at all. Instead, they could remain home, aiding our production and construction abilities enormously. However, mercenary forces struggle to fight as well as well-trained regulars."
  lns_mercenary_primacy:0 "Mercenary Primacy"
  lns_mercenary_primacy_desc:0 "If the bulk of our troops comprise of mercenaries far from home, we'll save the bulk of our manpower for the home front. Regular units of Lone Star natives can then act as special forces or support battalions, allowing them to gain combat experience without fear of mass casualties."
  lns_mercenary_frontlines:0 "Mercenary Frontlines"
  lns_mercenary_frontlines_desc:0 "Even if just the frontline units of our army are made up of mercenaries, we will save significantly on casualties and allow a much greater standing army."
  lns_regular_frontlines:0 "Regular Frontlines"
  lns_regular_frontlines_desc:0 "We should aim to restrict our use of mercenary forces to only support and garrison roles, meaning that regular troops will take up the bulk of frontline fighting. This will mean we fight significantly better, casualties will begin to mount up..."
  lns_regular_only:0 "Regular-Exclusive Armies"
  lns_regular_only_desc:0 "Mercenaries can't be depended on to form part of our armed forces. We must ensure our armies are made up only of loyal, local soldiers."
  lns_tbh_deputies:0 "Old World Conscription"
  lns_tbh_deputies_desc:0 "Long before the Great War, conscription was introduced to ensure there was always men available to defend the nation. We should follow this lead, introducing a general draft of loyal men."
