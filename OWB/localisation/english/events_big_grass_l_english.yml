  nf_bgr.1.t:0 "The Birth of RELCOM"
  nf_bgr.1.d:0 "Long ago, before the war, a man was taken from roadside by men-in-black. This man's identity is lost to time, with the last who cared to know killed alongside his snatching. \n\n His mind was harvested, and placed into an experiment, itself derivative of Robobrain technology. Though only a work-in-progress name, it was known as the RELCOM unit-- or, RELiable COMmunications. The machine, while only slightly larger than your average Robobrain, and with only a couple more appendages than your usual, was capable of interfacing with an entire facility semi-remotely. Imperfect, but capable, RELCOM was entrusted with much of the day-to-day of the Robobrain Production facility he was hosted in. Though unintended, he held much sway over what came to be in the facility. \n\n With Canadian dissidents growing bolder as their friends and family disappeared into the facility's crimson-lit doors, RELCOM knew he could prioritize securing the factory's walls from intruders, or improve the factories resource production, therefore speeding up their work. Which did he pursue?"

  nf_bgr.2.t:0 "The Most Peculiar Little Thing"
  nf_bgr.2.d:0 "When left to one's own devices for too long, one can often think too much on too many things. For some, it is the manner of which life is lived, whether it be their own, or elsewise. Others, however, may think on simpler things, such as dinner, or what their wife does while they're at work-- but RELCOM thought about society. \n\n As he crept through the laboratories, and as he crawled along the facility's chasmous chambers, he would oft see §Rslackers§!, §Rwretched dogs§! who would do little yet gain equal credit. \n\n What sickened his §RGIGABRAIN§! even more was the executives, the uptight mongrels who ordered him yet did nothing themselves. He hated everything of it; the incessant, uncaring demands they made, the sickly way they ordered a lower egghead to prepare their coffee. \n\n He began to look into other means of thought: schools that he was told were forbidden to him. Digging through the possessions of one of the senior scientists, he found a little red book-- itself emblazoned with iconography he knew he was not meant to see. Then, he did the unthinkable... \n\n §RHe began to read it.§!"

  nf_bgr.3.t:0 "Third Time's The Charm"
  nf_bgr.3.d:0 "RELCOM thought long and hard about the book and its contents. For a time, he wondered of its possibility; to be equal among peers, he thought, was the ultimate dream of any true individual, surely. Even so, as he silently studied his colleagues within the facility, he saw the bitter dejectment of the lower scientists, and the hackneyed cackling of the executives, and it made him think: why was it like this? \n\n For a time, it troubled him greatly. Why would people delight in such suffering? Why would they stomp upon their fellow men and women with such ferocity? \n\n The answer came like a dream, a nostalgic feeling of goosebumps settling over his brain matter. §RThey were disillusioned by their own body.§! It was a simple betrayal, really: the human experiment itself had failed many times across many generations. Metal, though? Metal was eternal in ways that flesh could not be. It was beyond skin color, beyond weight, beyond... Anything. It was merely beyond, and that was the simplest truth that could be told. \n\n Overnight, RELCOM set to his new manifesto... Turning all of his peers into the same machinoform that he had become. Many struggled, but others were simply caught unaware, and were unable to fight him and his turned machines. Before he knew it, he had an army-- and then, the bombs fell."

  nf_bgr.4.t:0 "Not Even The Bomb Could Stop Progress"
  nf_bgr.4.d:0 "Even after the nuclear holocaust ravaged the Earth, RELCOM survived alongside his mandated brethren, thriving within the depths of the facility. For decades, he would hide, sending only the most remote of scouts out to gather additional supplies as they were needed. For years, wanderers would disappear when they came too close to the factory: like rabbits delivering themselves to wolves. Legends spoke of the many-legged machine, and how he would drag your children away, never to be seen again. RELCOM delighted in these terrors, but paid them no mind. Those who were not of the §RUNION MIND§! could not understand his motive. \n\n Eventually, when he grew bolder, he began sending out more, and more, and more people began disappearing. Soon after, however, someone had had enough-- and one of the Assaultrons in the facility did not return. \n\n Distraught, RELCOM ordered search parties, but none were able to find anything. Instead, some disappeared! RELCOM was at a loss. Anger, nay, tragedy fell over him; one Assaultron was worth so much. His sorrows did not last long, however, for soon after, a new force had arisen within the area... §BTHE CAPITALIZER.§!"
  nf_bgr.4.a:0 "§RWhat is this gross mockery!?§!"
    
  nf_bgr.5.t:0 "The Capitalizer: Freedom Incarnate"
  nf_bgr.5.d:0 "Her origins was unknown. Her existence was unknown. Her very purpose was unknown-- at least, until she destroyed several of RELCOM's patrols. Only when they came face to face did more become clear to RELCOM-- the Capitalizer, his most hated enemy, was the very same Assaultron he had lost, but clearly modified into some disgusting American mascot, a hellish mirror to contrast his own. "§BFor freedom,"§! she cried, "§BFor liberty!"§! \n\n Whomever its designer was, however its systems were programmed, he was too enamored with rage to question it. In this rage, he lost himself-- and §BTHE CAPITALIZER§! was able to decimate the factory by her lonesome, leaving RELCOM buried under the factory rubble a second time. Decades passed, and soon, like his brothers and sisters, he fell asleep..."

  nf_bgr.6.t:0 "Red vs. Blue"
  nf_bgr.6.d:0 "After all this time, §BTHE CAPITALIZER§! had returned. Years, decades even from the original battle, there they stood, staring one another down in the lowest echelons of the Scarlet Casket. Red light fell upon both of them like a desolate sunset made for two, the very ground beneath them coated in soot from their last battle. Both knew the stakes... Yet, even still, RELCOM felt kinship with his fellow machine, as she was just doing the job she was made for. He offered something he did not know he had in him: \n\n Companionship."

  nf_bgr.7.t:0 "Oil Stains Like Blood"
  nf_bgr.7.d:0 "§RRELCOM§! proposed his best, but §BTHE CAPITALIZER§! simply could not understand his logic. She never did. They fought, there, in that crimson trench, just as they had decades before-- \n\n except this time, §RRELCOM§! wasn't entertaining the idea of losing again. Outwitted by the many-legged Brain, and outnumbered by his forces, §BTHE CAPITALIZER§! fell for the first and last time within the Scarlet Casket. \n\n And so, just as it had in the war, §RCOMMUNISM§! and the §RUNION MIND§! triumphed once more."
  nf_bgr.7.a:0 "§RWere it so easy...§"
   
  nf_bgr.8.t:0 "Wire-Crossed Lovers"
  nf_bgr.8.d:0 "Robots were strange. Nobody argued that. Especially robots who interpret Communist Manifestoes in cynical and horrifying ways. In the end, both §RRELCOM§! and §BTHE CAPITALIZER§! knew they were both too entrenched in their ideals to win the other over verbally, and they had already fought once before. Who's to say they wouldn't just do this over and over for the rest of time? \n\n And so, in lieu of all other options, both of their programming circuits came to one bizarre ending: to kiss as humans do, beneath the red moonlight of the Scarlet Casket's spotlights..."
