  nf_mot.1.t:0 "Marching Forth from Baker"
  nf_mot.1.d:0 "When 38 NCR citizens were slaughtered by raiders outside the Mojave town of Needles, the NCR Congress was quick to call for action. Then-President Tibbet was reluctant to commit troops to the area at a time when the NCR was already fighting costly wars in the north and west, but such an excuse fell on deaf ears in the Senate. Tibbet lost a no-confidence vote soon thereafter and was replaced by Wendell Peterson, who soon ordered three batallions of NCR Troopers to invade and pacify the area. \n\nIn 2274, following scouting by detatchemnts of NCR Rangers and the discovery of the mostly intact Hoover Dam, the Mojave Expedition's mandate was vastly expanded to cover the entire area from Needles to New Vegas. Reinforced with four fresh battalions and supported by two Ranger divisions, General Oliver marched from Baker towards the Mojave Outpost in March 2274 at the orders of the President to begin the \"Pacification of the Mojave\" and shape the Mojave for decades to come."
  nf_mot.1.a:0 "With Baker as a base, the expedition has solid foundations."
  nf_mot.1.b:0 "Years of fighting in the Southern Mojave had hardened all."
  nf_mot.2.t:0 "The Raiders of the Mojave"
  nf_mot.2.d:0 "While NCR Rangers had scouted the Mojave Wasteland in the years before General Oliver's march from Baker, they had done little more than provide an overview of key locations and factions to the General. Between the Mojave Outpost and the Hoover Dam there were a sum total of 0 friendly outposts, meaning that General Oliver had an uphill fight ahead of him if he wanted to establish clear supply lines to and from the Dam. \n\nThe first major settlement for General Oliver to seek to pacify was Nipton. Once a small community, Nipton thrived after the Great War as a refugee town and trader settlement. Specialising in drugs and prostitution, the town became a major hub for the Fiends' narcotics trade: with a healthy Fiends garrison to boot. Naturally, it became the first military target for the Mojave Expedition to contend with, and the tactics employed in the battle would influence later conflicts."
  nf_mot.2.a:0 "Troopers searched every house to esure the town was clear."
  nf_mot.2.b:0 "Once the bulk of the Fiends retreated, the town was safe."
  nf_mot.3.t:0 "Powering the Mojave"
  nf_mot.3.d:0 "When NCR Rangers first scouted the Northern Mojave in 2273, they stumbled upon a hulking concrete barrier stretching across the mighty Colorado. Unlike many of the river blockages in California, this one wasn't caused by a crashed plane or insane Supermutant: this wall was created long before the Great War by an America in her prime. Fondly dubbed the \"Old World Wall\" by the Ranger team that found it, the wall turned out to be none other than the great Hoover Dam: long presumed to have been reduced to ash in the Great War. Instead, the Dam stood infront of them in its full glory and without a crack along its surface. To the shock of the engineers the NCR scrabled to take a look at it, the Dam even turned on for them, producing power from two turbines with a dull buzz. It truly was a marvel. \n\nThe discovery of the Hoover Dam sent the NCR Congress into a frenzy. For decades, the NCR had struggled to provide power for even its major cities, let alone the countryside. Now, with the discovery of the Hoover Dam partially functional, the path to providing reliable and sustainable power to all of California was clear: if they could only get the other damn turbines working. Sure, they might have to send New Vegas 5% of the power they generated, but..."
  nf_mot.3.a:0 "With some \"miscalculations\", power sent to Vegas was minimized."
  nf_mot.3.b:0 "That was a fair price to pay for peace!"
  nf_mot.4.t:0 "Skirmishes with the Mojave Brotherhood of Steel"
  nf_mot.4.d:0 "When we first came to the Mojave, we discovered a chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel carrying out technology raids across the wastelands. They were far from home, and led by a somewhat fanatical and unpredictable chapter leader: Elijah. In the early days of our campaign we clashed with them on numerous occasions, but both sides knew the Mojave Chapter had neither the manpower nor equipment to contest our control of the majority of the Mojave. Instead, the Brotherhood took up residence on the site of HELIOS One, a pre-war solar array filled to the brim with the kind of ancient technology the Brotherhood obsess over.\n\nThe unstable status quo that settled into the Mojave can't last forever, even if both sides would lose from a prolonged conflict. However, under political pressure from Shady Sands, we've begun military preparations for §OOperation: Sunburst§!: a large-scale assault on HELIOS One with the intent of securing it for the Republic and wiping the Brotherhood from the Mojave. Noticing our preparations, the Brotherhood have started preparing too for the inevitable conflict. The balance of power between our two nations can be seen from our §OPreparation§!: the more preparation we have over the Brotherhood, the more effective our troops will be. The relatively small scale of the Operation means that every bit of preparation matters!"
  nf_mot.4.a:0 "Weakening their ability to perform requisition raids must be a priority."
  nf_mot.4.b:0 "We need to get to know them better, first of all."
  nf_mot.4.c:0 "Our only option is to destroy them. Make preparations."
  nf_mot.5.t:0 "Defending the Mojave"
  nf_mot.5.d:0 "While the Mojave Chapter may be defeated, and we seem to be temporarily safe from foreign threats, a sense of unease still settles over Mojave Defence Committee. Formed of the most talented military minds the Mojave Campaign has to offer, it offers advice for overall strategy to General Oliver, who has the final say on all military decisions within the Mojave. The Committee has always quietly grumbled about Oliver overriding many of their recommendations in favour of bold, flashy and prestigious offensives, but they are all loyal to the Republic and respect its chain of command. Following orders and disagreeing with them are very different things, however, and over recent months Ranger Chief Hanlon has begun to voice his discontent at Oliver's tactics, arguing a more cautious approach would save lives: a view which is echoed by others on the Committee. The two will surely have disagreements going forwards, especially as war approaches once more."
  nf_mot.5.a:0 "We need to keep an eye on this dispute..."
  nf_mot.6.t:0 "Supplying the Mojave"
  nf_mot.6.d:0 "The Mojave was far from hospitable terrain before the Great War. After it, great swathes of the Mojave became scorching, radiation-filled deserts. Movement of troops and civilians is difficult, and largely restricted to two major trade routes: Route 95 and the I-15. Even more difficult is the movement of supplies. Caravans are slow and bulky, and often have to navigate off established trade routes to reach outposts and garrisons in strategic, rather than convenient, locations. While we had enough supply to support the establishment and expansion of our current outposts, any future efforts to expand upon, resupply or establish bases will require the investment of supply. \n\nWe can gain supply through concerted efforts to do in our focus tree, or through negotiating for it from the NCR government. It can be used for various projects, available later in our focus tree. Additionally, one tenth of our supply is added to our attack and defense."
  nf_mot.6.a:0 "Compromises may need to be made."
  nf_mot.7.t:0 "The Great Khans attack Camp McCarran"
  nf_mot.7.d:0 "The Great Khans, a tribal group that has resided in the Mojave Wastes for years after being expelled from California, has long been a thorn in our side. Since our arrival in the Mojave, we have been in constant clashes with their forces wherever our troops are garrisoned. Their warrior culture is incredibly strong, and they make good wariors as a result, costing us dearly in skirmishes. Over recent days, however, their attacks have increased in frequency. Today, this came to a head when an entire Khan Warband launched an assault on Camp McCarran. \n\nThe attack left a bloody toll on both sides, with our troopers being forced to abandon much of the courtyard and retreat into the main terminal. It was only thanks to Rangers hastily redeployed from the Hoover Dam that the Khan advance into the camp was halted. Sensing their momentum had run out, the Khans made a quick retreat, taking a significant number of supplies in the process. It seems the Khans will become a real issue..."
  nf_mot.7.a:0 "This must not happen again."
  nf_mot.8.t:0 "Conquest's Bitter Aftermath"
  nf_mot.8.d:0 "The forces of the Mojave Expedition, led by General Oliver and spearheaded by Chief Hanlon's Rangers, has held most strategic points across the Mojave for months now. After the defeat of the Mojave Chapter and signing of the Treaty of New Vegas, the Expedition faces no organied military opposition. However, as the NCR's war-weary troopers are just discovering, beating the Brotherhood and occupying a handful of settlements was the easy part of the campaign. Despite some bold inititives, Oliver's Mojave Expedition has been more or less unable to actually \"pacify\" the Mojave. Organised military opposition may be eliminated, but supplies are far too sparse to heavily garrison settlements, and raider groups move freely and rapidly across the Mojave every day. To cap off the bleak picture is the ever growing threat posed by Caesar and his Legion on the far side of the Colorado: drawing even more on the Expedition's stretched resources. \n\nWith the list of objectives vast, the Mojave Defence Committee has been assembled to deliberate over the question of the \"Second Campaign\". On the one side, General Oliver advocated for a continuation of current policy: offering limited garrisons to settlements where necessary, but prioritising local autonomy to save manpower. Chief Hanlon, meanwhile, seeks a more radical policy of withdrawing the bulk of the Expedition's forces to a series of hardpoints—Hoover Dam, Camp McCarren and a variety of smaller camps—while leaving settlements to their own devices. There is little appetite for Hanlon's strategy back home, but considering the Expedition's mandate is \"Pacification, not Emanciptation\" there's a good case to be made for his tactics. The debate will rage late into the night..."
  nf_mot.8.a:0 "Without the support of settlements, we will perish!"
  nf_mot.8.b:0 "We simply don't have the manpower to spare."
  nf_mot.9.t:0 "A Coming Storm"
  nf_mot.9.d:0 "A great conflict is coming. From the Mojave Defence Committee to the lowest NCR troopers, everybody knows that a mighty foe lies across the Colorado. Our camps across the Colorado have already clashed with this foe multiple times, and it is only a matter of time before they are assaulted in force. Their objective will be, without doubt, the Hoover Dam: what better way to please a warlord than capturing one of the greatest man-made structures in America for him? We've long known that conflict will come to the Hoover Dam, but not the direction it would come from. Now, we can start making a concrete plan for the defence of the Dam from the Legion's hoards, and the Mojave Defence Committee is brimming with ideas on how to fight them off effectively. \n\nThe two strongest voices, General Oliver and Chief Hanlon, have rallied supporters around their two contrasting ideas. General Oliver advocates for the total defence of the Hoover Dam, fortifying it significantly and funneling the Legion's overwhelming numbers into a narrow area. Chief Hanlon, meanwhile, belives the Dam to be poorly defencible at best: instead, he believes the real fight will be over Boulder City, where the Legion could be tricked into an explosive trap. Both ideas have their strengths and weaknesses, but only one can be approved by the Committee..."
  nf_mot.9.a:0 "The Dam Must Hold!"
  nf_mot.9.b:0 "Fortify Boulder City"
  nf_mot.10.t:0 "Dust and Debris"
  nf_mot.10.d:0 "Explosions. Earth-shattering explosions. We could feel them from the Hoover Dam, and doubtless even from Shady Sands. Before our very eyes we watched the Divide's very ground twist and deform, rendering the entire valley completely impassable by human life. The cause of the explosions is unknown, but the strong radiation leaking out of the valley implies it must have been none other than nuclear missiles deep under the ground. Hundreds of lives, from caravan guards to NCR troopers, are surely lost in the tragedy. To make matters worse, one of only two supply routes into the Mojave is now completely unusable."
  nf_mot.10.a:0 "The Long-15 is our only hope now..."
  nf_mot.10.b:0 "Assemble a squad of Rangers: there must be a way through!"
  nf_mot.11.t:0 "Burn the House Down"
  nf_mot.11.d:0 "It appears that rebellious elements in Vegas have killed House! With his defeat, perhaps we can take advantage of the disaster and occupy New Vegas?"
  nf_mot.11.a:0 "We have more pressing priorities than Vegas..."
  nf_mot.11.b:0 "With House out of the way, our path to Vegas is clear!"
  nf_mot.12.t:0 "The Tables are Turning"
  nf_mot.12.d:0 "When we first ventured into the Mojave, New Vegas lit up bright in the sky. Mr House and his robots, egar to meet us, ventured forth from the walls of the city to our camps on the Hoover Dam, telling tales of their golden city: the jewel of the Mojave. While House's Securitorns seemed fierece, they were few in number, and House's only other allies were rag-tag groups of tribals that had become the \"families\" of New Vegas. It seemed, should the Expedition want to, New Vegas could be relatively easily conquered: certainly at no more of a cost than the Operation Sunburst. The order to conquer New Vegas never came, however. Instead, the Treaty of New Vegas was signed, guarenteeing New Vegas independence and 5% of the Hoover Dam's power output. The treaty made some sense: faced with the Mojave Brotherhood, raider groups and the growing Legion threat, the NCR simply could not afford another powerful enemy. \n\nThe circumstances now have changed ever so slightly. No longer is the Mojave Brotherhood much of a threat, and the immediate threat imposed by raider groups has been reduced, strengthening our position somewhat. Moreover, fresh divisions have joined the expedition. There is an argument in the Mojave Defence Committee, championed by General Oliver, to continue our military build-up and by consequence dwarf House's power: dissuading him from ever attacking. Chief Hanlon instead argues that we should look for allies amongst the \"families\" of New Vegas, possibly even leading to backing a pro-NCR coup in the city. Bringing New Vegas into the fold would be a huge victory, but also risks making enemies of a powerful foe."
  nf_mot.12.a:0 "With a numerical advatage we can dissuade any attack."
  nf_mot.12.b:0 "Reach out to some of the \"families\": we may have some allies."
  nf_mot.13.t:0 "Divide and Conquer"
  nf_mot.13.d:0 "Disturbing rumours have been circulating on the strip for the last few days: rumors of dark money and illegal weapons being smuggled across Vegas' mighty walls. According to the few sober sources we can find, it seems that the weapons are being run to a variety of New Vegas' families for seemingly little reason. The origin of these weapons and caps seems even tougher to find, but we have some reason to believe the guns may come from none other than NCR Rangers themselves! \n\nIf these facts can be corroborated, they'll pose a serious change in policy from the Mojave Territories, and may even indicate an attempted coup is on the horizon. Regardless, the weapons threaten to destabalise the delicate balance of power between the New Vegas families. We best be careful."
  nf_mot.13.a:0 "Worrying to say the least."
  nf_mot.14.t:0 "The Ranger and the Robot"
  nf_mot.14.d:0 "Ever since the NCR established the Vegas Embassy, we've suspected the company it hosted was not entirely friendly. Indeed, we had strong suspicion that the NCR were running an undercover Ranger detatchment from the building, right under our noses, to try and infiltrate our ranks. We've never been able to prove it. \n\nThis morning, just outside Goodsprings, a very special person was arrested and detained by an NCR Ranger squad. One of the many Couriers we sent to deliver to us the Platinum Chip, Courier 6 was the most reliable Courier to date. Alas, even they seem to have been unable to avoid the Bear's watchful gaze, and the Platinum Chip he was carrying has been confiscated. Sources inside the NCR inform us that it's being swiftly moved back to California, under heavy guard. \n\nThe Courier's arrest and the Chip's confiscation mean only one thing: that the NCR knows of its importance. With our plans for the Bear and the Bull now in tatters, we need to carefully consider how to proceed. Our securitron army alone may be enough for us to overwhelm the Mojave Expedition's forces, allowing us to capture the Hoover Dam and the chip. It's a risky move..."
  nf_mot.14.a:0 "Rip up the Treaty!"
  nf_mot.15.t:0 "Civilian Rule in Bakersfield"
  nf_mot.15.d:0 "Bakerfield has been under martial law for years as part of the Mojave Expedition's remit. But with their increasing control of the Mojave, the territory has been returned to civilian rule. It is only a matter of time before we extend the same liberties to the rest of the Mojave . . . and perhaps, beyond."
  nf_mot.15.a:0 "To the torch of the Pacific!"
  nf_mot.16.t:0 "Oversight Rejected"
  nf_mot.16.d:0 "The Mojave Territories have largely acted as a nearly independent army up until now. With limited federal oversight, despite our continuous support, many called for an investigation and report on the current state of the Mojave. Given the threats poised by their endless protracted war, [MOT.GetLeader] has persuaded the NCR Council to avoid that possibility. Some of our citizens may question the 'endless quagnmire' but we will, ultimately, prevail."

  nf_mot.17.t:0 "The Bear's Last Meal"
  nf_mot.17.d:0 "[MOT.GetLeader] has demanded we submit to New California's demands and become an 'associated territory' of the Republic. This would end our independence and make us a puppet in all but name. Although new California is our greatest market, can we really submit to these demands?"

  nf_mot.27.t:0 "The Three-Card Bounty"
  nf_mot.27.d:0 "While we may have overrun the Fiends and captured Vault 3 some months ago, we always knew dislodging the scum from their stronghold would be far from the end of the group. Sure enough, after Motor Runner's death three leaders rapidly sprang up: the infamous Violet, Cook-Cook and Driver Nephi. Countless squadrons of NCR Troopers have been dispatched over the months since our capture of the Vault to attempt to bring the three to justice, but none have been successful. Almost all we send end up dead, and those that survive are usually so scared they wish they were slaughtered alongside their friends. For months now the works of these three have tied up vital men and equipment that could be much better used against the Legion or Vegas. So infamous were the trio that the Republic even set the so-called \"Three-Card Bounty\" on their head, offering 250 Caps for the confirmed kill of any individual and a bonus 300 Caps for the elimination of all three. The leaders truly are a menace. \n\nMore accurately, they were. Following an intervention today by a combined taskforce of the 1st Recon, an elite sniper team, and the Baja Brothers, the most experience Ranger assault for in the Republic, all three have at last been put down in one fell swoop. It sure as hell wasn't easy even for such a formidable fighting force: 12 good soldiers were lost in the fighting. With their deaths, however, we've freed up much-needed manpower that would otherwise have been tied down for years to come. Thank God."

  nf_mot_news.2.d:0 "Close to two weeks ago, a squadron of Rangers was sent on an expedition from Ranger Station Delta, situated in the heart of the Mojave, to assess the scale of the damage done by recent explosions near Hopeville and Ashton. The area, now infamously dubbed \"The Divide\", once was a major NCR supply route between Shady Sands and the Mojave. Now, thanks to a number of mysterious nuclear detonations from dormant silos across the valley, the ground itself has become twisted and malformed. Still, the NCR hoped there would be a safe way through for their supply convoys, and so the Rangers were dispatched. \n\nA week has now passed since the NCR's last contact with the Rangers. While they managed to survive longer than any scavengers that ventured into the twisted land, reporting back to Ranger HQ about the horrendous nuclear storms and ghoulified troopers patrolling the wrecked land, it still seems unlikely they will ever return from the hellscape again. The Rangers have been officially declared \"Missing in Action\" by the NCR, and a military funeral will be held in Shady Sands in their honour this weekend. Their disapearence serves as a stark warning to any that are considering traversing the broken landscape: not even the NCR's finest could survive."

A pragmatic deal at the time, the treaty ensured friendly relations between New Vegas and the Mojave Expedition in exchange for the NCR sending 5% of the Hoover Dam's power to the Vegas Strip. While the uneducated observer may see the treaty as greatly beneficial to the NCR, House has used the treaty to fleece thousands of NCR troopers and citizens of their hard-earned caps, and given him breathing space to begin to restore New Vegas to its glorious past. The NCR, on the other hand, grumbled that it should be the one to own New Vegas, but in the face of the Mojave Brotherhood and Legion they could do little but agree to the terms. \n\nFor years, the treaty has stood without incident: until today. In an official announcement from Mr House himself on Radio New Vegas, it was announced the treaty would be annulled with immediate effect, citing \"an act of espionage\". Securitrons also moved to close down the NCR embassy in the city and expell all NCR troopers from the Strip, in a move sure to provoke retaliation from the NCR. The NCR Conrgess has yet to respond to the move, but troopers are already moving to Camp McCarren as we speak."
