  # Generic Flavour Events
  flavour.1.t:0 "Unrest Amongst the Slaves"
  flavour.1.d:0 "While our slaves have never been terribly happy with their working conditions and social standing, over recent weeks it seems our slavers have become particularly rebellious to our orders. Sparked by an influential slave leader in [Root.Capital.GetName], sporadic clusters of violence against slave owners has spread across the nation in the past few days, with slaves defying orders and even attempting mass breakouts. While their core demands are little more than better conditions and food, we risk setting a dangerous precident should we bend to the slaves. Crushing them, on the other hand, would surely break the spirit of the slaves for decades to come, but could be costly in men and stability. What are we to do?"
  flavour.1.a:0 "Make minor concessions."
  flavour.1.b:0 "Crush the revolt!"
  flavour.1.c:0 "[Root.GetLeader] will crush the revolt personally!"
  flavour.2.t:0 "Traders from Hawai'i"
  flavour.2.d:0 "Far to our west, past the hulking wrecks of oil rigs and minor military islands, lies the isles of Hawai'i. Once, according to a book we once found at least, these islands were also a part of America and the home of the American Pacific Fleet. By 2077, the Pacific Fleet was a vast collection of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, destroyers and missile-boats. Most of the fleet was in port at the start of the Great War, and was wrecked by the multitude of Chinese nuclear missiles that hit the port. The tribes of this Hawai'i now make a living scrapping advanced components of the countless wrecks, trading for weapons and food with settlements up and down the West Coast. This morning a cluster of native traders from Hawai'i arrived in out ports, offering a plethora of rare goods for a price. It's an opportunity we won't get for some time!"
  flavour.2.a:0 "Come, tell us war stories from your homeland."
  flavour.2.b:0 "Buy some of their exotic goods for our people."
  flavour.2.c:0 "Strike up a year-long trade deal with them!"
  flavour.2.e:0 "Turn them away..."
  flavour.3.t:0 "Traders from Southern Empires"
  flavour.3.d:0 "In the decades that followed the Great War, radiation soaked into the great forests and jungles of South America: irradiating the wildlife and poisoning the air. The jungles drank up the radiation of those horrible warheads, slowly twisting out of all recognition into an irradiated hellhole. Once tame animals became vicious hunters, and the multitude of snakes and spiders grew in size drastically: preying on each other and the humans that remained. While South America was spared direct nuclear hits, they suffered terribly from mutated wildlife and failing crops. The survivors of the first decade would slowly regroup on the coasts and the Patagonian plateau into one of the many \"Southern Empires\": great raiding groups who controlled vast swathes of territory, always at war with each other and struggling to get by. \n\nNot all those who resided in these \"Southern Empires\" subscribed to their raiding philosophy, however. Coastal communities, retaining independence through the payment of tribute to various factions, have become wealth trade hubs. Trading animal hides and delicious rainforest fruits, these South American city-states have slowly been strengthening their trading links with nations on the Gulf of Mexico, who trade advanced components and scrap metal in exchange. A fleet of trading ships has recently docked in our ports, and offers us a rare opportunity to snap up some rare commodities. We should act quick though, as they seldom stay for long!"
  flavour.3.a:0 "Ask to learn how they cultivate these fruits."
  flavour.3.b:0 "We should pay them to teach us the art of diplomacy."
  flavour.3.c:0 "Strike up a trade deal!"
  flavour.3.e:0 "We can't make a purchase now..."
  # Unique Flavour Events
  flavour_unique.1.t:0 "The [Root.Capital.GetName] Incident"
  flavour_unique.1.d1:0 "One of the worst-kept government secrets before the Great War was the existance of \"Zetans\": extra-terrestrial beings that have been observing the human race from outer orbit. While the American government never officially acknowledged their presence (they had other things on their mind, after all), it was taken as a more-or-less certain fact by the public that these aliens were here to stay. Sure enough, the Zetans seem to still be here over two centuries after the Great War they surely watched with gleeful excitement. How do we know? Well, it seems a Zetan spacecraft has crashed near [Root.Capital.GetName]. The two Zetan occupants, identified due to their freaky resembalance to pre-war graffiti, remain alive and are putting up a solid defence of their crashed ship. A few of our soldiers have already perished when scouting it out, but surely with a co-ordinated assult we can surely overwhelm the two defenders and reach the craft."
  flavour_unique.1.d2:0 "A great comet has fallen out of the sky! Burning brighter than our fires, it crashed down to the ground from the heavens above last night. Some of our tribesmen dared approach it, hoping it was a gift from the gods, but found only death and destruction around it. Two little green men, with weapons that spewed pure light, defended the comet bravely. They must surely be the warriors of the gods, here to test us before we can reach the great comet's treasure. If we want access to the blinking lights and whirring sounds of the comet, we must defeat these holy guardians!"
  flavour_unique.1.a:0 "Leave it be..."
  flavour_unique.1.b:0 "Break it down for scrap!"
  flavour_unique.1.c:0 "Haul it away and study it."
  flavour_unique.2.t:0 "Vault 187 Opens"
  flavour_unique.2.d:0 "Much to the suprise of the residents of [Root.Capital.GetName], they have been living on top of a vast Vault-Tec experiment their entire lives. Vault 187 seems to have be a network of sub-vaults located in nearby towns, each connected by an extensive maze of tunnels sporting a significant number of man-made barricades and strewn-about skeletons. We'd identified the entrances to some of these sub-vaults before, but each appeared to have been forced open. From the accounts of the decendants of the original Vault Dwellers, this appears to have been part of the wicked experiment Vault-Tec subjected the Dwellers to. Vault-Tec opened the Vault doors to each of the sub-vaults after two years of the Great War, forcing each sub-vault to fight their way to the central chamber. Of course, the central chamber had room for but a few, and so vicious warfare broke out between the 12 sub-vaults as each vyed for control of the last radiation-free area in the Vault. After more than a decade of fighting, Vault 187-08 arose victorious, though over 8000 men, women and children died before they could achieve their goal. Then and only then was the central chamber to Vault 187 sealed and extensive food supplies were revealed, allowing the decendants of those who fought the bloody war to thrive: until today. \n\nBlinking, the first Vault Dwellers from Vault 187 emerged into the harsh sunlight of the Wasteland. Unfortunately for them, their main vault door opened right below one of our many military camps: the first Vault Dwellers were swiftly apprehended and brought before [Root.GetLeader]. Our advisors are anxiously working out what to do with the rest of the Dwellers. We could surely convince them to join us in our fight to survive the wastes, but should we keep them alive they'll certainly refuse any efforts we make to scrap their Vault. Instead, we could eliminate them with a surprise attack. Many innocents would die, but is the scrap worth it?"
  flavour_unique.2.a:0 "Teach them about the new world: they will join us."
  flavour_unique.2.b:0 "Kill them all, and scrap the newly uncovered Vault."
  flavour_unique.2.c:0 "Persuade them to join us, and then scrap their Vault!"
  flavour_unique.3.t:0 "Stoppen or Die Young Stumpy!"
  flavour_unique.3.d:0 "The hardest part of roaming the Wasteland isn't the vicious wildlife, nor is it the cannibalistic raiders. No, instead the hardest part is finding a comfy place to sleep. Tonight is no exception, but hope is in sight: on the horizon you've spotted a small shack with a roof still standing. You draw near, already looking forward to taking off your boots and kicking back after a long day. Signing, you open the door and drop your bag. Then words pierce through you, jerking you back to reality. \n\n\"Stoppen or die young stumpy! In the name of Steiner Von Grinchenhauzen! Why do you come her and interrupt our meeting of death?!\" The man is shouting at you in a thick German accent despite being three feet away, as a dozen men stand around him embroiled in strange insignia. \n\n\"I was just looking for a place to stay? Who are you?\" you retort back, hand moving to the pistol on your hip. \n\n\"Don't ask me questions minion, unless Steiner tells you to! Sie Ratte! Just looking, eh? Well then I congratulate you on your impeccable luck and senses! For we are about to invade your little Wasteland and turn every ounce of your people's joy into tears of anguish so that I may drink them! And you happened to stumble into the temporary camp of the Officers! For your luck, minion, I will spare your life, but only if you agree not to interfere with our plans and remove the limbs of all life here!\" \n\nYou raise your eyebrow in disbelief at his words: clearly the radiation outside has muddled this poor man's brains. Before you can conjur up a response to him, Steiner continues. \"Pleasure meeting you measly wastelander. Though my bulging intellectual prowess tells me you have more power in this and than I initially thought. Auf Wiedersehen.\" \n\nWithout another word, Steiner and his Officers brush past you and out the door. You prepare to bed down for the night, still speechless as Steiner's crazy words bounce around your brain. Hours pass, and finally you've conjured enough words to articulate a response."
  flavour_unique.3.a:0 "\"What in the goddamn?\""

#### mexican flavour events
mexicoflavour.1.t:0 "Día de los Muertos"
mexicoflavour.1.d:0 "Today marks the traditional celebration of the Day of the Dead. While the origins of the festivity have been mostly lost in the centuries after Armageddon, the spirit of supernatural celebration and ancestral remembrance remains strong. All across Mexico, from the highest classes to the lowest, commemoration of the event unites the people, cementing this small connection with the world that has passed for another year."

mexicoflavour.1.b:0 "A strange, but quaint tradition."
mexicoflavour.2.t:0 "A Thanks to the Gods"
mexicoflavour.2.d:0 "Today's date marks the celebration of Thanksgiving in Mexico. Even though the festivity of the holiday has been burnt away by nuclear fire, the idea of thanking Gods has remained. Across Mexico, Tlaloc gives food and tries to impart the mostly American tradition on the people of Mexico. The Mexican people thank their Gods and pray for another year of safety and survival."

mexicoflavour.2.b:0 "Our traditions and spirit will be restored."

mexicoflavour.3.d:0 "Even after two centuries of survival in the deserts, cities and jungles of Mexico, we mark this day and remember the Great War, as many of us still remember the day the bombs dropped, this day marks the destruction of our nation and the end of the world. But we will continue to prosper for another year."
mexicoflavour.3.a:0 "We need to celebrate our survival."
mexicoflavour.4.t:0 "The Gift from Above"
mexicoflavour.4.d:0 "Over the centuries, the weather has changed drastically ― radiation storms and droughts ravage the wasteland. As seasons change in Mexico, our people and especially our farmers, once more pray for rain and prosperity of our crops, so let's hope this year is plentiful."
mexicoflavour.4.a:0 "And the heavens answered."
mexicoflavour.4.b:0 "A dry wasteland once more."
mexicoflavour.5.t:0 "Domingo de Gloria"
mexicoflavour.5.d:0 "Today marks the celebration of Easter in Mexico. Even though big celebrations are not a thing in this ruined world, the festivity and the idea of the holiday has remained. Across Mexico people are celebrating and try to bring the tradition back to Mexico. It would seem that the practices of the old world are not completely extinct."
mexicoflavour.5.a:0 "Get me a Capiriotada!"
mexicoflavour.6.t:0 "Old World Day"
mexicoflavour.6.d:0 "Today we celebrate Old World Day, a day commemorating our traditions and pre-war celebrations that turned to ash by nuclear fire. This day will be our remembrance to the Old World and its heritage, and a day celebrating our survival for another year."
mexicoflavour.6.a:0 "We will not forget our traditons."
mexicoflavour.7.t:0 "The Anniversary of the American Occupation"
mexicoflavour.7.d:0 "Today marks a grim day in Mexican history, the beginning of the American Occupation. Even after two centuries, the people of Mexico still remember when American forces entered Mexico for the first time. The Occupation led to the annexation and colonization of North Mexico and to a Pro-American Puppet Mexico, the creation of Petro-Chico, an arm of Poseidon Energy and the creation of Rio Grande, whose American soldiers helped Mexican citizens after the bombs dropped. Despite the centuries that have passed, the people of Mexico still have the fire of resistance in their heart."
mexicoflavour.7.a:0 "Our people will continue to fight."
mexicoflavour.7.b:0 "A liberation, not an occupation."
mexicoflavour.7.c:0 "A stain on our history."
mexicoflavour.8.t:0 "Hurricane Tlaloc Hits Southern Mexico!"
mexicoflavour.8.d:0 "Hurricane Tlaloc, named after the God of rain and storms, just made landfall in Southern Mexico, bringing destructive winds and rain, reports suggest that heavy damage was common, leaving many roads and buildings destroyed and hundreds of people injured. Once again, the wasteland must endure."
mexicoflavour.8.a:0 "We'll pray for them."
mexicoflavour.8.b:0 "Deploy the emergency teams!"
mexicoflavour.9.t:0 "The Great Southern Fire"
mexicoflavour.9.d:0 "Past Mexico, civilisation ends. The irradiated ruins of Central America are home only to migrant tribes and refugees, with only the Guerreros of Honduras braving the jungles beyond. Now, from beyond the Panisthmus, Great columns of smoke can be seen coming from the land known as South America. Across South Mexico, the smoke covers the sky, bringing panic and confusion to all of Mexico, as the smoke has no explanation."
mexicoflavour.9.a:0 "Let's hope for the best."
mexicoflavour.9.b:0 "Out of sight, out of mind"
mexicoflavour.9.c:0 "We will hold, whatever is out there."
mexicoflavour.10.t:0 "Debris Hits Our Shore!"
mexicoflavour.10.d:0 "After the bombs fell, most ships that were ocean-born at the time turned quickly into ghost ships after their crew ran out of food or died from radiation. To this day, countless derelicts still roam the seas, drifting along with the currents. Today, one of these wrecks came across our shore, its shadow casting over our salvage team. A gift from §BChalchiuhtlicue§!, god of the oceans, it seems."
mexicoflavour.10.a:0 "Scrap it!"
mexicoflavour.10.b:0 "We can learn from this."
mexicoflavour.11.t:0 "§RWE LOVE GENERALISSIMO DAY§!"
mexicoflavour.11.d:0 "Today, all of Gente Del Sol celebrates Generalissimo Day! A day celebrating our invincible, unbeatable, and incalculably attractive leader! Our Generalissimo has done a lot for the people of Gente in these years! Many people remember when our Generalissimo single- (and bare) handily defended Puerto-Libertad bravely against waves of monstrous cangrejos! At our handsome and virile Generalissimo’s speech today, he proclaimed: \"Our place in the sun will be found!\" and \"It is you, my friends, who I thank for making me what I am today. Without your lives to rule over, I would be nothing. I am as proud to be your leader as you are to be my subjects! Long live Gente! Long live the Generalissimo!\" This eloquent and impassioned speech was met with a mandatory five-minute standing ovation, and one elderly gentleman was reported to have fainted from the sheer passion felt by the citizens of Gente for their leader."
mexicoflavour.11.a:0 "Long live the Generalissimo!"
mexicoflavour.12.t:0 "The Day of Founding"
mexicoflavour.12.d:0 "Today marks the anniversary of our great empire's beginning, celebrated through the acts of the First Speaker. While her actions and personage have long since passed into myth, our First Speaker, the Lifebringer, is venerated today for her great deeds in founding the Aztlan empire. Festivities and processions across the empire commemorate the actions of the First Speaker and her legendary acts of unification across Mexico, culminating in a great midnight feast to celebrate the life and prosperity she brought to these lands.  While Speakers have come and gone since the Lifebringer, her legacy in the heart of the Aztlani people will never be replaced."
mexicoflavour.12.a:0 "Glory to the Empire!"
mexicoflavour.13.t:0 "The Great Defeat"
mexicoflavour.13.d:0 "Today marks a somber moment for the Aztlani empire, commemorating the great failure of the Northern War against Tlaloc, and their crushing defeat at the hands of the God-Machine. While the scars have mostly healed, the lives lost in that disastrous campaign left a hole in in the Aztlani people, and remembering their passing in a day of mourning is only a small part in healing the great wound of that defeat."
mexicoflavour.13.a:0 "A most regretable affair."
mexicoflavour.13.b:0 "Let's not dwell on it."
mexicoflavour.14.t:0 "Day of Waves"
mexicoflavour.14.d:0 "Today, the shores of Itza are thronged with crowds, keen to watch the day of seafaring and racing that marks the Day of Waves. Instituted by the Kalomte to bolster Itza's long naval tradition, the holiday has become a national affair, with prospective racers keen to prove their sea-legs and gain the attention of the keen-eyed admiralty, who have taken to watching the day's events with interest."
mexicoflavour.14.a:0 "What a grand day!"
mexicoflavour.14.b:0 "Take note of the winner."
mexicoflavour.15.t:0 "International Coffee Appreciation Day"
mexicoflavour.15.d:0 "One of the few company-wide public holidays in the Costa plantations, International Coffee Appreciation Day is a day of mandatory festivity amongst the plantation-workers, who get to enjoy the fruits of their labour and even a half-days work, all at the generous largesse of the Baron himself. This holiday has begun to slowly spread amongst Costa's international clientele, through judicious discounts offered on select products during the day's trading."
mexicoflavour.15.a:0 "Drink up!"
mexicoflavour.15.b:0 "Mines still glowing, is that a good thing?"
mexicoflavour.16.t:0 "Unexploded Nuclear Bomb"
mexicoflavour.16.d:0 "Despite the centuries that have come and gone, the horrors of the Great War continue to rear their ugly heads. In the outskirts of a rural village, the undetonated remains of a low-grade nuclear warhead were uncovered by farmhands breaking new ground. While panicked at first, it became clear that the bomb was a dud, and we are now left with the decision to either cordon off the area, or attempt to defuse it."
mexicoflavour.16.a:0 "Let's not tempt fate, leave it be."
mexicoflavour.16.b:0 "Caution is for fools, open it up!"
mexicoflavour.17.t:0 "All quiet on the Southward Front"
mexicoflavour.17.d:0 "Living in the south of Mexico, one has become accustomed to living with the ever-present danger of untold horrors emerging from the southern wastelands. Today, however, that terror is lessened, what few tribals that live in the jungles seem to be content, and no great flames or warcries echo over the irradiated mountains. \n\nLet's enjoy the peace while we can."
mexicoflavour.17.a:0 "No news is good news!"
mexicoflavour.17.b:0 "It's a calm, but where's the storm?"
mexicoflavour.18.t:0 "Annual Employer Appreciation Day"
mexicoflavour.18.d:0 "Today marks the one of the most important festivities of the Petro Chico tribals, the 'National Employer Appreciation Day.' Apparently originating from sort of pre-war holiday, the day consists of all current adherents to the great 'Compnee' giving devotion to their local and overarching leaders, or  demonstrating thankfulness for their guidance and rulership over them. These local leaders in turn give penance to their upper-management overseers, progressing all the way to the top, where El Seeyo prostrates himself to the terminal of Tlaloc. Needless to say, nothing useful gets done."
mexicoflavour.18.a:0 "Long Live the El Seeyo!"
mexicoflavour.18.b:0 "Are they masochists or something?"
mexicoflavour.19.t:0 "Independence Day"
mexicoflavour.19.d:0 "With the independence of the Viceroyalty from Aztlan still in recent memory, the anniversary has become somewhat of an important day in West Mexico. To the Viceroyalty traders, it is a day of great festivity and celebration, with businesses sometimes even closing early to celebrate. For the Aztlani loyalists, it is a more somber affair, and often studiously ignored to the point of willful ignorance, for fear of appearing unpatriotic."
mexicoflavour.19.a:0 "For Freedom!... And profit."
mexicoflavour.19.b:0 "We should really update our calendars."
mexicoflavour.20.t:0 "Santa Anna's Birthday"
mexicoflavour.20.d:0 "On this day, in Feburary 1794, Santa Anna's human predecessor entered the world. While the new Santa Anna is a far cry from his ancient forerunner, and details of his past life are gleaned only from Tlaloc's fading memory banks, the AI still feels a fond connection to this day, and has taken to observing it in his own quiet way. This fact has been capitalised on by Santa Anna's more judicious subprograms, who have began to foster commemoration of the day in the local populace, who are quite confused but nonetheless happy for an extra day of celebration."
mexicoflavour.20.a:0 "Happy birthday son, I'm so proud of you."
mexicoflavour.20.b:0 "Send him a giftcard."
mexicoflavour.20.c:0 "Is that a grey pixel in my hair?"
mexicoflavour.21.t:0 "Anniversary of Maximilian's Coronation"
mexicoflavour.21.d:0 "Centuries ago, another Maximilian ruled over Mexico. His rule, from what can be gathered, was short, doomed to fail, and ultimately tragic, but nevertheless serves as precedent to the new emperor's imperial vision. While the details of Maximilian's first coronation remain sketchy, The AI has created a fanciful revision of history in his memory. Substituting the blank space for a lavish ceremony filled with joyous celebration by subject and ruler alike, where a new era of peace and prosperity for Mexico was cemented by the placing of the luxious Imperial Crown upon the blessed monarch's head. Maximilian's attempts to relive the joy of this false memory have taken the form of a mandatory public holiday, where his subjects are cajoled into celebrating all night and are educated on the greatness of benevolent absolutism and the generosity of their liege."
mexicoflavour.21.a:0 "Send him a celebratory e-mail."
mexicoflavour.21.b:0 "I miss that crown..."
mexicoflavour.22.t:0 "Of Fire and Rain"
mexicoflavour.22.d:0 "Many of the ancient traditions of the Mexican people were lost to history by the Spanish invasion and occupation. Even the life of Moctezuma, reborn through circuitry and steel, is a mystery even to him. The databanks of his late father can only give hints of the era that was lost, distorted and reviled by Yanqui revisionism. But Moctezuma has faced greater obstacles. Taking his own rebirth as a portent, he has begun to rebuild the traditions of the ancient Nahuatl peoples. These rituals, warped by his own corruptions, have become farcial monuments to chaos, New Fire ceremonies send plumes of smoke into the sky. and low-altitude missiles are used as cloudbreakers to bring the gift of Tlaloc's rain. The people are bewildered and terrified, but the work of rejuvenation has begun, and none but Moctezuma can see where it ends."
mexicoflavour.22.a:0 "In destruction, rebirth."
mexicoflavour.22.b:0 "Wait, why is this even a holiday?"
mexicoflavour.23.t:0 "Constitution Day"
mexicoflavour.23.d:0 "Zapata's lifelong fight for Mexico's soul was one that cost him his life, and while his beloved country may now be unrecognisable, there is one great achievement he still holds dear, that even the revisionist propaganda of Tlaloc's memorybanks could not erase: The Constitution of 1917. Socialist, progressive, and Revolutionary with a capital R, the constitution to Zapata remains the guiding light of his AI directive, and the signing of this document in February 5th has become a national holiday in his new lands. While Zapata's citizens, and those of Mexico as a whole may still labor under injustice, as long as the constitution guides, hope remains for Mexico."
mexicoflavour.23.a:0 "Well, if it makes him happy..."
mexicoflavour.23.b:0 "Viva Mexico!"
mexicoflavour.24.t:0 "Showdown in the Great Ring"
mexicoflavour.24.d:0 "Los Mochis was afire this afternoon, when local crowd favourite Chavo Guerrero faced a Royal Rumble grudge match against fifteen foes in succession. The towering titan lasted over half an hour in the ring, before finally succumbing to a tag team clothespin that sent him out of the ring. While ultimately losing, Chavo's legendary stamina has won him even more fans in the ring today, and he promises to make his next bout last an hour as soon as his broken arms heal."
mexicoflavour.24.a:0 "What a match!"
mexicoflavour.24.b:0 "I hate those freaks..."
mexicoflavour.24.c:0 "What a match!"
mexicoflavour.25.t:0 "Tales from Afar."
mexicoflavour.25.d:0 "Mexico is not the only land of titans and fallen empires. Traders from across the north are a frequent sight in our lands, and they bring with them tales of adventure and heroism that'd put the Aztlani jaguar warriors to shame. A few of these stories have become local favourites, but as the water merchants gather around the fireplace, which one should we hear today?"
mexicoflavour.25.a:0 "Tell us of the Chosen One."
mexicoflavour.25.b:0 "Tell us about the Great Calculator,"
mexicoflavour.25.c:0 "Do you have any new stories by any chance?"
mexicoflavour.26.t:0 "The Pancho Parade"
mexicoflavour.26.d:0 "It's a grand day in Colonet today, as the people of the Baja celebrate their newfound prosperity and safety under the leadership of Pancho Villa. The semi-spontaneous festivities, apparently unknown even to Pancho himself, have carried on into the night, with singing, dancing, and feasting in continuous succession. A new folk song has even been written as an ode to Pancho, extolling both his sagicity as a leader and more...physical attributes."
mexicoflavour.26.a:0 "It is all for you, my people!"
mexicoflavour.26.b:0 "What a showoff."
mexicoflavour.27.t:0 "The Gringo"
mexicoflavour.27.d:0 "Smuggling goods in and out of the N.C.R. has become something of a national institution in La Paz, and while the yanquis aren't that fond of it there's quite little they can do about the situation. Of course, that didn't stop their foolish attempt to send an infiltrator down south to track down our contacts in California, and it certainly didn't stop their near immediate discovery and capture by our security crew. Now stripped of their fake moustache and a frankly insulting poncho, the gringo is pleading for safe passage back to the N.C.R. in return for a hefty ransom. What shall we say to this offer?"
mexicoflavour.27.a:0 "They can go home... For a price."
mexicoflavour.27.b:0 "They're not going anywhere."
mexicoflavour.28.t:0 "Mining, or Crafting?"
mexicoflavour.28.d:0 "The local Pinacate forum has been brought to a standstill today over what can only be considered one of the dumbest arguments of the new century. Apparently, the Works department has been drawn into two belligerant camps over funding primacy, with one side favouring investment into large-scale mining projects, while the other insists on allocating funds for new craft workshops. The situation has gotten nowhere, and so it falls to us to settle this age old debate: Mining, or Crafting?"
mexicoflavour.28.a:0 "Mining, of course."
mexicoflavour.28.b:0 "Crafting for sure!"
mexicoflavour.29.t:0 "Sinaloa Red & the Arizona Ranger"
mexicoflavour.29.d:0 "The town of Ultimo came to a standstill today over a deadly confrontation between one of Arizona Ranger remnants and a local cartel thug by the name of Sinaloa Roja. According to local reports, the narco had been a local nuisance in the town for the past few months, and had been expecting the royal treatment from all visitors, including the ranger. When the ranger refused, a high-noon duel took place in the town square, with the ranger filling Roja with lead before he even drew his pistol. While a small gesture in the grand scheme of things, this act of frontier justice has done much to enure the rangers in the eyes of the local populace."
mexicoflavour.29.a:0 "Now that's how you do business."
mexicoflavour.30.t:0 "The Sinaloa Circuit"
mexicoflavour.30.d:0 "While the Great Race follows the ancient raceways and highways of old, tenderly maintained and restored by the Two Sun acolytes, new race courses are mapped out daily by daring racers, seeking to find the perfect blend of tight corners, wide open lanes, and daring twists and turns. [THIS.GetName] has recently codified a new course spanning half of northwest Mexico dubbed the 'Sinaloa Circuit,' and has set the competition afire with their highs-speed record time. While it won't be long before their time is challenged, [THIS.GetName] has more than proven their skill has a high-octane racer."
mexicoflavour.30.a:0 "Fang it!"
mexicoflavour.31.t:0 "El Presidente Day"
mexicoflavour.31.d:0 "The office of president in the Rio Republic is not merely the head of state, the holder represents the combined will, optimism, and resilence of the Rio people. Seeking a fitting way to commemorate and honour this office, the people have taken an old American tradition and revived it for the new age. 'El Presidente Day' celebrates not only the current leadership of Rio, but the very democratic institution and the great sacrifices the country has made to remain free within and without. It's also a great day for barbequeing."
mexicoflavour.31.a:0 "Viva [THIS.Getleader]!"
