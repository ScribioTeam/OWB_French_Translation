It was never formally recognised by the government, but now it is time for us to reform the state of Deseret inside Utah and bring a new age of religious prosperity to our lands. \n\n§HTo form Deseret, we require all states in Utah. Due to limitations with decisions, this decision will highlight only one state at a time, giving you an indication of which states you still need to conquer.§!"
