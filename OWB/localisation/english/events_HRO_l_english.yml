  nf_houston.1.t:0 "Joe 'Ball' Magson's Death"
  nf_houston.1.d:0 "The state of our affairs wasn’t always so shabby. A long time ago, we used to pick some of our own to become ‘Rocketeers’ and being one was the highest honor you could be given. People looked up to the Rocketeers; it was a badge of honor to be part of the esteemed group that used to work alongside each other to lead the Rockets through better or worse. Nowadays, being a Rocketeer means you’re part of the snooty higher-ups that run the show now, while the rest of us toil and slave away at the bottom.\n\nBack in those days when being a Rocketeer meant something, Joe Magson really exemplified a true leader, not only to the Rocketeers, but to all of us and to the surrounding nations around Texas. He really was a man for the people and never backed down from supporting the common man, even when his enemies and rivals pressured him to act otherwise. Even now, his name evokes hope amongst our downtrodden and acts as a callback to simpler, better times. It’s a damn shame that assassination ended his life so abruptly and violently, but we all know who’s responsible, and it’s high time we avenged him..."
  nf_houston.1.a:0 "Those militia backstabbers killed Joe!"

  nf_houston.2.t:0 "The Common-folks Chem Crisis!"
  nf_houston.2.d:0 "For all the work we do not only to keep the Houston Rockets going and to keep our loved ones safe and fed, there are only a few avenues of recreation and entertainment that give us much needed respite; chems being one of them. Centuries ago, people used chems recreationally and no one complained.\n\nTo the chagrin of the common folk, chem usage has been formally banned in Houston for the past few years. Many see this policy as a method for the Rocketeers to maintain control over the everyday Houston resident and as a punishment for the dissent that occasionally simmers over and breaks out into the occasional protest. It’s a bad situation all around, but there is some hope on the horizon. A motion has come before the Rocketeers that demands nothing short of full legalization of chem usage in Houston. It would be nice if the government accepted this motion, but it’s not clear whether or not they’ll pass it or throw it out entirely…"
  nf_houston.2.a:0 "We can’t legalize due to…"health reasons"."
  nf_houston.2.b:0 "It's 'high' time to legalize."

  nf_houston.3.t:0 "Revival of our Satellites!"
  nf_houston.3.d:0 "Ms. Sion Con Trol was crowded with Houston’s best scientific and military minds, the air filled with excited murmuring and a wide variety of emotions ranging from apprehension to excitement. Today was the day that the room, and by proxy, the Houston Rockets, would take its first step into the brave new world that they were creating for themselves. The sheer excitement was palpable and the commotion seemed to never end until a decorated general, no doubt the head of this project, called for their attention.\n\n"Ladies and gentlemen. Centuries ago, our people dedicated themselves to something great, something a very few would ever experience; spaceflight. They designed impressive pieces of armor that could withstand the harsh environment of space, created metallic satellites that constantly transmitted data from hundreds of miles above them, and built enormous missiles that could carry the most precious payload of all; man. Picking up their work has not been an easy task, but centuries later, we have done it. Today, after years of incessant searching and research, we have managed to identify a working satellite. Today, we will re-establish contact with this satellite and finally take the first step in following our ancestors’ footsteps."\n\nAs applause, cheers, and whistling erupted around the room, the general nodded towards a small officer below him whose hands were poised to begin typing. “Lieutenant, begin transmission.” The eyes in the room turned towards the young officer who began typing away furiously at the terminal in front of him, his eyes glued to the dusty RobCo screen. Seemingly endless lines of teledata poured in front of him, his pupils dashing back and forth in an effort to parse the information. Ms. Sion Con Trol waited with bated breath; this entire endeavor rested on one man’s shoulders, but in this moment, he didn’t seem aware of that fact.\n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, the young lieutenant looked up from the console, his face beaming. Excited beyond comprehension, he uttered the first thing that came to mind."
  nf_houston.3.a:0 ""Houston, we have connection.""

  nf_houston.4.t:0 "The Mont"
  nf_houston.4.d:0 "The Mont is the Houston Rockets’ second official city. Basically bordering Houston itself, the city was a hub of Pre-War technological wonders before the bombs fell. There is no better testament to this fact than the hulking factorial complex inside the city that serves as its crown jewel. The various untouched, nearly vintage machinery and parts in the factory would undoubtedly breathe new life into our own decrepit industries. However, a local scrapper/prospector union has taken up ownership of the factory and has made it clear that they are not willing, under any circumstances, to sell or negotiate with us for the factory or any of its parts.\n\nThe union is tiny compared to our collective might, so sending in our troops wouldn’t be an issue at all and we’d have the factory under complete Rocket control by the end of the day. However, killing a union would undoubtedly send waves throughout the populace, who already hate us enough. Our choices here ultimately come down to whether our need for increased industrial capability outweighs our need for a stable, peaceful populace and vice versa..."

  nf_houston.5.t:0 "Leaking"
  nf_houston.5.d:0 "Houston’s always taken pride in its extensive water pipelines that help hydrate its people and irrigate its land, but like all infrastructure, it needs constant repair or else the whole system will eventually fall apart. We are starting to see our pipe network fall apart; over the years, numerous sections of the network have either become inoperable or have simply fallen apart due to lack of maintenance. While the areas where the damage has occurred have been rather well irrigated, individual towns and settlements have lacked a consistent and reliable water supply, and the number of such areas is only growing. The outrage over our people not getting their much needed water is growing, and we need to fix this ASAP.\n\nWhile plans are already underway to repair our water supply pipelines, we need to set up stopgap measures that will provide immediate relief to the most heavily affected areas; our cities. Fortunately, we should be able to meet most of the cities’ water needs via sending our water reserves via brahmin caravan, but this will consume most if not all of our available reserves. Water is the most precious currency in nearly all of Texas; sending our reserves to the cities will ensure our peoples’ safety, but we may need these reserves for whatever the future may hold. It’s a tough and terrible call, but it’s one we have to make…"
  nf_houston.5.a:0 "We have to maintain our reserves"
  nf_houston.5.b:0 "To hell with that, get them to the cities."

  nf_houston.6.t:0 "Protests?!"
  nf_houston.6.d:0 "Tensions have always simmered under the oppressive rule of the Rocketeers, but they are finally boiling over into something more serious. While sporadic, isolated protests by disillusioned militia veterans and a heightened state of unrest have become commonplace to the average Houstonian, this is something completely different. Hundreds, if not thousands of residents have taken to the city’s streets to protest the numerous injustices carried out by the Rocketeers and other members of the government; namely, the indefinite delaying of elections, which is ostensibly a violation of the democratic ideals that have become an important part of Houston for so long.\n\nThe protests have grown so quickly and exponentially that it would not be hyperbole to say that the entire city is in an uproar. Enormous crowds have gathered outside important government buildings, as well as the Hall of Rocketeers. With torches, weapons, and other various items in hand, the protestors are easily poised to ransack and completely destroy the Hall and other buildings. This is a crisis in which we have no good hands to play; sending in loyal militias to disperse the crowds by any means necessary will cause us to lose any favor that we may have had left with the people, and they most certainly will use lethal force. But letting these protestors do as they please will cause severe damage to infrastructure and to others not involved in the chaos. What should we do?"
  nf_houston.6.a:0 "Kill the protestors."
  nf_houston.6.b:0 "Let them protest, they’ll tire out."

  nf_houston.7.t:0 "Election Season"
  nf_houston.7.d:0 "Something is happening that we haven’t seen in a long time, something that we didn’t think was going to happen in Houston again within our lifetimes; the government has finally allowed regional elections. Granted, it’s a change that’s long overdue and probably only happened because the Hall of Rocketeers was nearly burnt down by hordes of disillusioned people and protestors, but it’s better than nothing. In fact, many Houstonians have been emboldened by this change and have turned up at the polls to cast their vote. The people’s choice has been narrowed down to two picks; the brilliant scientific mind Sanchez, and the grizzled but ever-so-sharp Captain Baptiste.\n\nBorn and raised in the area, Sanchez has worked her way into the Research sector and has been the poster child for Houston’s research efforts. That’s not to say she’s a hero amongst the everyday man; not many people like her. However, she does have the support of the Rocketeers as well as others in office, so she has been able to make an impressive bid for office by running on a platform centered on revitalizing Houston and further unlocking its scientific capabilities.\n\nOn the other hand, we have the venerated Captain Baptiste, a veteran of countless conflicts and skirmishes that have all targeted the Houston Rockets. None can question his loyalty to Houston; since his foiling of the Patrolmen attack of 2273 to the innumerable raider gangs that he has successfully put down, he has never hesitated to answer the call of duty. For this, many of Houston’s common folk revere him similarly to how Joe ‘Ball’ Magson is viewed. However, his popularity amongst this population has caused the Rocketeers and the government to be suspicious of him. Baptiste fights for Houston, but does he fight for its upper, dominant class?\n\nThe ballots have been counted and the people have spoken. The winner of this election is..."
  nf_houston.7.a:0 "Sanchez. To the stars, and beyond."
  nf_houston.7.b:0 "Baptiste. For the people, by the people."

  nf_houston.8.t:0 "Deserters?"
  nf_houston.8.d:0 "Disturbing reports have come in from Army command regarding the growing issue of deserters. While one or two occasional cowards doesn’t necessarily put a dent in Houston’s overall defense, desertions have recently become much more common and larger in scale. Division commanders report entire battalions laying down their arms. This obviously creates holes in our defences against Houston’s enemies and bares her vulnerability for all the world to see.\n\nThere is no doubt that these lily-livered cowards never had the spine in the first place to defend Houston in the first place, and the Rocketeers will see to it that each and every one of these deserters are soon punished. However, the growing number of defections has caught the attention of the public, and it would be in our best interest to address this issue before seditious elements in Houston are able to take advantage of this."
  nf_houston.8.a:0 "Houston doesn’t forgive treason."
  nf_houston.8.b:0 "We, uh...huh, they left?"

  nf_houston.9.t:0 "Civil War"
  nf_houston.9.d:0 "It’s come down to this; after years of pushing Houston to the breaking point and with a complete breakdown in communication between the members of the Rocketeers, the government, and the people, tensions have boiled over and full scale fighting has broken out. What has started as small-scale fighting between neighbors and townspeople has begun spreading across the nation and is only increasing in ferocity and scale. Before long, brothers and sisters will turn weapons on each other, and the soil in Houston will be irrigated with the blood of the dead. The very soul of the nation is at stake and the stars, which Houston once reached long ago, will be looking down on us, pitying those that survive and live in this hell, for only the dead will have seen the end of war."
  nf_houston.9.a:0 "Is this not fratricide?"

  nf_houston.10.t:0 "Libercity"
  nf_houston.10.d:0 "Perhaps there is no city in the wastes more aptly named than Libercity; founded by slaves who tore off the yoke of their oppressive masters and fled to find a new life, settlers who moved away from Houston in order to pursue a career unfettered by the oppressive Rocketeers, and prospectors who simply wanted to settle down, Libercity was built off of the ruins of the Old-World city of Liberty. It’s not as impressive as her bigger sister city, Houston, nor does it have the sheer amount of resources as either Houston or The Mont, but Libercity’s citizens can live their own lives mostly free of Houston’s follies and societal tensions.\n\nLibercity’s proximity to Houston has allowed it to enact a sort of brain drain and resource drain on its bigger neighbor. Because of this, the town council has recently been approached by Libercity’s engineering union with an interesting proposal. Utilizing what spare resources that can be allocated, the council has been provided the option with restarting the solar energy power plant to provide denizens with free, sustainable electricity and light, or creating an extension with Houston’s water pipeline network that would provide clean drinking and irrigating water. While having both would be nice, the town council only has enough resources to build the critical infrastructure needed for one project."
