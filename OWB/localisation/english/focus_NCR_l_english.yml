  ncr_founders:0 "Honoured Founders"
  ncr_founders_desc:0 "Among the historical records of the NCR, there are a number of figures that stand out as quintessential to the republic, yet who among them is most celebrated in propaganda and education? Who shall appear on the most important pieces of currency, be mentioned in speeches, and stand above the rest as the figurehead of the NCR?"

  ncr_tandi:0 "Tandi's Scheming"
  ncr_tandi_desc:0 "Tandi devoted her life to the cause of the New California Republic, and early in her life, her ideals faded and she was faced with honest pragmatism. She made a series of hard choices, many of which did not necessarily earn her the adoration of her people."

  ncr_development:0 "Development Of The Republic"
  ncr_development_desc:0 "Roughly 20 years ago, the NCR Congress proposed one of the most ambitious economic development plans in the history of the wasteland, a large scale investment into each of the Major population centres of the NCR, the quaternary cities of Shady Sands, Dayglow, the Boneyard, and Sac-Town."

  ncr_navarro:0 "The Battle For Navarro"
  ncr_navarro_desc:0 "The Battle of Navarro was the first real test of the NCR's military. With full congressional approval and a blank check, the NCR formed the most massive army the wasteland had seen up until that point, an enormous conglomeration of volunteers, mercenaries, and conscripts. Backed up by a sizeable detachment from the Brotherhood of Steel, they marched on the last holdout of the Enclave."

  ncr_councilhill:0 "Council Hill"
  ncr_councilhill_desc:0 "The Senate has always been the centre of the Republic. Many of the Republic's most influential members are apart of the Senate. Giving them a place worthy of their status will not only give hope to the people of the wasteland, but also appease the secretly greedy and narcissistic Senators that will fill the seats at the newly christened Council Hill."

  ncr_armament:0 "The Emporium of Armament"
  ncr_armament_desc:0 "Despite its economic prosperity, Shady Sands also stands as a testament to the military might of the NCR, as it is where the majority of the army is trained and equipped. For this reason, thousands of arms merchants travel here each year in an attempt to secure a long-standing contract with the NCR, providing arms for currency, in addition to earning a permanent shopfront in the city."

  ncr_bazaar:0 "Reorganizing the Bazaar"
  ncr_bazaar_desc:0 "The capital of the NCR attracts strangers from distant lands. Tribals come to peddle mystical relics, scavengers attempt to pawn off electronic doodads and junk, and on occasion, cloaked strangers try to sell advanced technology from ages past, as the city is one of the only places in the Wasteland were one can do such a thing without fear of being robbed by the Brotherhood of Steel."

  ncr_powerplant:0 "Refurbishing the Power Plant"
  ncr_powerplant_desc:0 "A city like Shady Sands consumes an immense amount of power, and with each year, the ageing electrical grid struggles to keep up with each change. As such, the addition of new generators and wind turbines are constant, be they nuclear or powered by solar rays, the growing of this grid is essential for the continued functioning of the city."

  ncr_militacademy:0 "Expand the NCR Military Academy"
  ncr_militacademy_desc:0 "In the centre of the NCR, not far from the Hall of Congress, one can find the Military Academy, a hive of activity where one can always spot dozens of men and women undergoing rudimentary military drills in the fields. One can also find aspiring officers in the middle of extensive education in the essentials of combat and team management within well-used classrooms. "

  ncr_oldworld:0 "Old World Wisdom"
  ncr_oldworld_desc:0 "At the Centre of the NCR's military doctrine is the concept of the Old World Military. The army is organized around a layered command structure, with intensive logistical support and the use of specialized troops. Many consider the NCR's attempts to mimic the doctrines of the old world as foolish, but one need only look at the success the NCR has had in dealing with raiders and tribes."

  ncr_armourexperiment:0 "Experimental Armour"
  ncr_armourexperiment_desc:0 "One of the chief roles of the NCR Military Academy is the R&D department, where weapons and equipment from the old world are continually being redesigned to fit the NCR's doctrines. Among the most significant recent developments, one can find the NCR Heavy Trooper, a man clad in unpowered armour. Immensely durable, but slow and cumbersome, an awkward weapon on the best of days."

  ncr_capitalfort:0 "Fortifying the Capital"
  ncr_capitalfort_desc:0 "One of the chief goals of the NCR military is the preservation of the NCR on the whole, and as such, there are few expenses spared when it comes to protecting the capital. Each year, the defences of the city are built higher and higher, even as the local garrison is increased to regulate and protect the teeming masses."

  ncr_rangerhq:0 "Expand Ranger HQ"
  ncr_rangerhq_desc:0 "Located far from the hustle and bustle of the Hall of Congress, and disassociated from the NCR Military Academy, is a small three-story building. At a glance, no one would ever suspect that this little complex is the heart of one of the most dangerous fighting forces the Wasteland has ever seen, the NCR Rangers."

  ncr_gammacore:0 "The Gamma Corps"
  ncr_gammacore_desc:0 "Often, mutants live isolated lives, one or two in a given community doing jobs that suit their immense physical stature. Mutants are barred from the general NCR military, along with ghouls, due to the impact their presence can have on the morale of the ordinary conscript; however, the NCR rangers have no such gripes."

  ncr_reorgranger:0 "Ranger Reorganization"
  ncr_reorgranger_desc:0 "The nature of the NCR Rangers is a complicated one, as it has for decades functioned as an entity separate to the NCR military. No more! The NCR Rangers shall be reorganized and integrated into the military proper, serving as the elite corps of the army, meant to deal with any danger that is too dangerous or important for the ordinary soldier to deal with."

  ncr_rangerprop:0 "Ranger Propaganda"
  ncr_rangerprop_desc:0 "With the integration of the NCR Rangers underway, it has become increasingly apparent that their role in NCR Doctrine shall only grow more important as time moves forward. This means, among other things, that the NCR is going to need a much more substantial quantity of Rangers to deal with the dangers of the wasteland, and as such an intensive propaganda campaign has been launched."

  ncr_beacon:0 "Beacon of Democracy"
  ncr_beacon_desc:0 "The might of the NCR cannot be understated, and one need not look further than Shady Sands to see why. Beacon of what the wasteland can become under the NCR, a mighty bastion of economic prosperity and military might. Even the most unenthusiastic citizen can feel a deep swell of pride when looking upon this sprawling metropolis, built up from nothing but sand and the dream of a better tomorrow."

  ncr_capitalfund:0 "The Capital Fund"
  ncr_capitalfund_desc:0 "The city of Shady Sands is one of the largest in all of the NCR, with an immense population. Strategically located on the border of Nevada, atop a dried lakebed that provides fresh water to this day, it is the centre of trade and economic prosperity within California. Each year, immense amounts of wealth are poured into this ever growing metropolis, and today is no exception to that rule."

  ncr_baja:0 "The Baja Blues"
  ncr_baja_desc:0 "Over thirty years ago, the NCR attempted a colonization of the Baja Peninsula, which ended violently for all parties involved. Since that day, increasing tensions have led to conflict along the border, a conflict that has threatened to boil over time and time again. Even now, ambitious raider gangs from Baja muster to threaten the NCR's borders."

  ncr_rangerdeploy:0 "Ranger Deployment"
  ncr_rangerdeploy_desc:0 "The Ranger Chief Hanlon, while sympathetic to the cause of the local populations, puts the prosperity of the NCR above all other things. His plan is one of action, one that involves taking down raiders in Baja with shows of open force, and if necessary, violent force."

  ncr_ultimatum:0 "Ranger Ultimatum"
  ncr_ultimatum_desc:0 "Ranger Chief Hanlon has issued a warning to the banditos of Valle and Paz, promising them death if they do not disarm. There is no reality where these men will agree to such an action, but that's the point. The Ranger's are attempting to bait them into making the first move."

  ncr_retake:0 "Retaking Rattletail"
  ncr_retake_desc:0 "Founded in 2256, Rattletail was an NCR colony that failed. Its people forced to evacuate after extensive violence with locals. The movement of NCR troops into this location is more than an act of defiance, it's a political statement. The NCR is here to stay, and Baja will never be the same."

  ncr_sympathies:0 "Local Sympathies"
  ncr_sympathies_desc:0 "Héctor Santángel is a local of Baja, and was no more than fourteen years old during the Rattletail Incident, which cost him his father. Despite this loss, he is a staunch supporter of what he believes the NCR stands for, and more importantly, what he feels the NCR can do for the people of Baja."

  ncr_repaid:0 "Rattletail Repaid"
  ncr_repaid_desc:0 "With aid from the NCR politician Sean 'Allgood' Murphy, Héctor Santángel has gained the necessary funding to begin the process of healing between the NCR and the people of Baja. Medicine, clean water and other resources are being sent to the People of Rattletail, who suffered the most due to NCR aggression in the past."

  ncr_bajastate:0 "The State of Baja"
  ncr_bajastate_desc:0 "The work of Héctor Santángel and Sean 'Allgood' Murphy has born fruit! The raider tribes of Baja are pacified, and the people are openly accepting and encouraging NCR rule and handouts. It appears that the formation of a new NCR state is on the horizon!"

  ncr_politicobandito:0 "Political Banditos"
  ncr_politicobandito_desc:0 "Grant C. Hayes, a successful politician from Dayglow, on the border of Baja, has come up with a plan to gain the loyalty of Baja. He intends to treat the local Banditos as independent governments, and humour them with a formal and governmental approach. Ideally, this should allow him to position himself for political gain, and avoid risking the lives of the Men and Women of Dayglow."

  ncr_payments:0 "Bandito Payments"
  ncr_payments_desc:0 "Although formal interaction hasn't worked particularly well, it has become apparent that the Banditos of Baja are looking for something the NCR has in spades. Money and power, two things that can easily be given to them in exchange for loyalty and political clout."

  ncr_emergency:0 "The Emergency Council"
  ncr_emergency_desc:0 "The Northern Farmlands of the NCR have been thrown into absolute turmoil following a violent clash of Baron's, who's mercenary armies now rampage, stealing cattle and gunning down citizens as they attempt to gain the upper hand in a wasteful scramble for power. The rest of the NCR is in shock, and starving due to the lack of produce from the north. Something must be done, and it must be done swiftly!"

  ncr_buyout:0 "The NCR Buyout"
  ncr_buyout_desc:0 "The Buyout Law establishes the mercenaries employed by citizens of the NCR can be drafted into the armed services at any point in time and that these mercenaries are to be held accountable to the same laws and standards as soldiers of the NCR. They are the be compensated at rates equal or greater to what they would have already been paid, and are managed by an appointed NCR official. Anton I. Flynn."

  ncr_baronofbarons:0 "The Baron of Barons"
  ncr_baronofbarons_desc:0 "Anton I. Flynn calls for the punishment of those Barons who started the conflict, with their land being divided and distributed back to those Barons who've been outside of the conflict. Those Barons that can be trusted not to wage open warfare on each-other and NCR citizens. Despite sounding idealistic, this is realistically a large scale business acquisition by Flynn and his constituents. "

  ncr_pokersiege:0 "The Siege of Poker's Ranch"
  ncr_pokersiege_desc:0 "For the man who started it all, Silus Poker, a reckoning has come at last. His death has been ordered by Anton I. Flynn, who has been tasked with ending the conflict in the north. The result of this is a two week long siege of the Poker Ranch, during which he and his extended family all perished, along with their own mercenary detail."

  ncr_newnorth:0 "The New North"
  ncr_newnorth_desc:0 "Under the guidance of Anton I. Flynn, the north of the NCR has been brought to peace. The economy is booming, and food flows south once again. Flynn has made himself one of the most powerful men in all of the NCR, and is on the fast track to winning the next election."

  ncr_diplomatic:0 "The Diplomatic Mission"
  ncr_diplomatic_desc:0 "Sean 'Allgood' Murphy is a curious figure within the NCR politician scene. A common man from the Boneyard with ties to both the Brotherhood of Steel and the Followers of the Apocalypse. He believes that the answer to the chaos in the North is one that can be easily solved with outside help."

  ncr_steeldeal:0 "The Steel Deal"
  ncr_steeldeal_desc:0 "The Steel Deal, as it's being called, is an attempt to reintroduce Brotherhood of Steel Patrol's in the north of the NCR. While this is heavily criticized by many, Allgood feels that the Brotherhood's no nonsense approach to combat, and their daunting reputation, will be enough to make the Baron's lay down their arms."

  ncr_patrol:0 "The New Patrol"
  ncr_patrol_desc:0 "The agreements with the Brotherhood of Steel, which involved the trading of assets in exchange for an increased presence in the north, has been moved into action. Dozens of Brotherhood Patrols now run between NCR settlements, and openly trek onto the land of powerful Barons."

  ncr_allisgood:0 "All is Good"
  ncr_allisgood_desc:0 "Despite some minor engagements, Allgood's gamble has worked. The mercenaries under the Baron's are unwilling to engage with the Brotherhood of Steel, who are slowly reclaiming the land in the name of the NCR. Many Baron's are openly returning to the fold, now that it has become clear they can't win this stupid gamble."

  ncr_exodus:0 "Exodus of Wealth"
  ncr_exodus_desc:0 " The NCR Military is taking a no nonsense approach to the situation in the north, and with full approval from the president, marches to arrest any and all troublesome Baron's. In reaction to this, the majority of Baron's are taking their wealth and quickly leaving the NCR. Heading for the neutral cities of New Reno and Klamath."

  ncr_milcentres:0 "Military Centres"
  ncr_milcentres_desc:0 "In order to ensure that such a large scale situation of violence never occurs in the North again, the NCR military has set about establishing a number of permanent military installations, each of which shall be in charge of patrolling and insuring the obedience of the Baron's that remain."

  ncr_brahminbill:0 "The Brahmin Bill"
  ncr_brahminbill_desc:0 "The Brahmin Bill is a piece of legislature that has overwhelming support from the Citizens of the NCR, as it officially breaks the monopoly of the various Brahmin Baron's, who are now required to sell their produce to the NCR's government for a vastly reduced price."

  ncr_rationing:0 "Organized Rationing"
  ncr_rationing_desc:0 " The food produced in the north of the NCR is now being distributed with intense military oversight, with the amount being sent to each region of the NCR being based heavily on need. No more shall large sections of the nation border on starvation while the Baron's make their fortunes."

  ncr_petersonswar:0 "Wendell Peterson's War"
  ncr_petersonswar_desc:0 "Wendell Peterson is not a popular president by any means, but he does have the military's loyalty. Working with the express goal of expanding the NCR's borders and permanently removing raider threats, Peterson has begun planning a large scale expedition. However, to do this he needs the approval of congress, which means pandering to a major political group."

  ncr_drummond:0 "Drummond's Demands"
  ncr_drummond_desc:0 "General Alexander Drummond, the Hero of Navarro, has been retired for over a decade. Although he is undoubtedly the most senior of any NCR military official, he will only return if the President gives him permission to engage in vast military reforms. Something that doesn't sit well with many politicians and citizens."

  ncr_oldworldmilitary:0 "Old World Military"
  ncr_oldworldmilitary_desc:0 "General Drummond is obsessed with the old ways of war, believing heavily in large scale assaults, extensive planning, and logistical organization. He believes in transforming the military into a powerful professional force."

  ncr_drummondreturn:0 "General Alexander Drummond Returns"
  ncr_drummondreturn_desc:0 "Congress has relented to Drummond's demands, and he is now ready and willing to return to office. Although this has caused a great deal of controversy, Peterson is too eager to begin his campaign to worry about approval ratings."

  ncr_baron:0 "The Baron's Choice"
  ncr_baron_desc:0 "The Baron's are the most powerful political force in all of the NCR, sporting private armies and extensive mercenary forces. They stand to gain greatly from this conflict, and leverage their support to Peterson on a number of business demands and reforms, as well as the appointment of a senior mercenary commander."

  ncr_industrialcomplex:0 "Military Industrial Complex"
  ncr_industrialcomplex_desc:0 "The Brahmin Baron's have little hand in the firearm trade, but they are certainly closely tied to such powerful and wealthy organizations. Under the table agreements involving mandatory government investments, the establishment of a new Military Industrial Complex, are written into each draft of the agreement with Peterson."

  ncr_bigjim:0 "The Hiring of James 'Big Jim' Marshal"
  ncr_bigjim_desc:0 "Big Jim Marshal is a former Desert Ranger who turned away from their just cause while seeking wealth and fame. He found it in the north of the NCR, where operates as a singularly successful pawn to the Barons. He's a popular figure, a tall imposing man with a powerful drawl and a no nonsense attitude, the ideal puppet for a wealth man."

  ncr_rangergeneral:0 "The Ranger General"
  ncr_rangergeneral_desc:0 "The Men and Women of Dayglow support the NCR Rangers utterly, and as such, so do the most powerful politicians of Dayglow, including the mayor Grant C. Hayes. Advocating for Ranger priority in this expedition, the mayor promises to give Peterson his full support in exchange for some reforms, and the appointment of a new Ranger General from Dayglow."

  ncr_standards:0 "Improve Draft Standards"
  ncr_standards_desc:0 "The NCR Rangers have complained for decades about the poor quality of the men and women brought in by the NCR draft. Often, one sees malnourished junkies or individuals with insignificant mental health being given a gun and asked to die for their nation. An improvement of the drafting standards should end this problem."

  ncr_mossman:0 "Appoint Ranger General Mossman"
  ncr_mossman_desc:0 "Very little is known about the NCR Ranger Veteran known as Mossman. He's a loyal friend of Grant C. Hayes, a stout supporter of the state of Dayglow, and a veteran of countless battles on the NCR's frontiers. He's a capable choice for commander of the expedition, despite his obscurity, and has the absolute trust of the NCR Rangers due to his seniority."

  ncr_openlong15:0 "Opening the Long 15"
  ncr_openlong15_desc:0 "The Raiders of Southern California have been a pain in the side of the NCR for decades, and so close to the capital as well! If Peterson's expedition is to succeed, they must be driven out, and the Long 15 opened."

  ncr_long15:0 "Rebuilding the Long 15"
  ncr_long15_desc:0 "The Long 15 is the singular artery that leads into the Mojave from the south, and it serves a role of the utmost tactical importance. The road, while in terrible condition, could easily be overhauled with the power of the NCR's economy behind it."

  ncr_mojaveoutpost:0 "Mojave Outpost"
  ncr_mojaveoutpost_desc:0 "At the Mouth of the Mojave, set atop a high hill, one can find the Outpost. A simply military checkpoint that is considered to be one of, if not the single most important military stronghold in all of the NCR."

  ncr_eviction:0 "Pushing for the Colorado"
  ncr_eviction_desc:0 "On the other size of the great Colorado sits the Legion, a spectre that hangs over the civilized NCR. If we are to be safe, we must be sure that our side of said river is protected, which will unfortunately require the removal of local tribal groups. Such as the Rapids."

  ncr_riverbank:0 "Riverbank Fortifications"
  ncr_riverbank_desc:0 "The Colorado has innumerable crossing points and landing zones, all of which are vulnerable to Legion assault. These must be properly defended, or major cities such as Dayglow could be threatened."

  ncr_aradeshport:0 "Founding Port Aradesh"
  ncr_aradeshport_desc:0 "On the bank of the Colorado, one can find a beehive of activity as the NCR military, working in conjunction with numerous colonists, begins the ambitious constructions of port Aradesh. Which should serve as a deterrent against the Legion."

  ncr_mojave:0 "Mojave Subjugation"
  ncr_mojave_desc:0 "The lights of Vegas shine in the distances, but the lands between here and there are a mess of raiders and other malcontents. Their defeat should and will be a priority for the expedition!"

  ncr_aradeshfort:0 "Founding Fort Aradesh"
  ncr_aradeshfort_desc:0 "Port Aradesh is successful, but our work is not done. It must become a stronghold on the riverbanks, a bastion against the savagery in Arizona. It shall be a symbol, and one day, it shall be a staging point for a counter invasion."

  ncr_mojavehero:0 "Hero of the Mojave"
  ncr_mojavehero_desc:0 "An unexpected hero has arisen from the Mojave Expedition, a common man named Aaron Kimball, who has gained fame for numerous victories and important, rousing speeches. Such a man could go far in this world, with the right ambitions, but for now? He is the hero of both the NCR and the Mojave."

  ncr_protege:0 "Kimball's Protégé"
  ncr_protege_desc:0 "Standing in the Shadow of Aaron Kimball is a man named Lee Oliver. While not the most brilliant of minds, he is a capable and tactical commander who understands how to use the strengths of the NCR against his foes. He is a capable right hand man for Kimball, and a rising star in the military. "

  ncr_oldworldwall:0 "Old World Wall"
  ncr_oldworldwall_desc:0 "Hoover Dam, called the Old World Wall by Ulysses, is a concrete arch-gravity dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River. It lies on the border between the former US states of Arizona and Nevada."

  ncr_riverpatrols:0 "Founding the River Patrol"
  ncr_riverpatrols_desc:0 "It seems that with each week, we find more and more agents of the Legion, scouts and spies, crossing the Colorado and entering the NCR. More so, our own scouts are actively reporting the growth of their own river fleet. This can not stand."

  ncr_damassault:0 "Assault on Hoover Dam"
  ncr_damassault_desc:0 "The Old World Wall has fallen into the hands of the wrong sort of people! A tyrant uses it as a beacon with which to project his power across the Mojave. This can not stand! It is the duty of the Mojave Expedition to stop him, and we shall!"

  ncr_triumph:0 "Triumphant Expedition"
  ncr_triumph_desc:0 "Following the NCR's victory at Hoover Dam, the Mojave Expedition has been recalled, with thousands of soldiers returning home. However, to replace them come thousands more, here to reinforce the border against the threat to the East. Now and forever, these are NCR lands."

  ncr_longmarch:0 "The Long March Home"
  ncr_longmarch_desc:0 "Following the NCR's crushing defeat at Hoover Dam, the Mojave Expedition has been recalled, with hundreds of soldiers returning home. However, in their place comes a more formal military expedition, with multiple battalions and a full compliment of rangers being dispatched to reinforce the border."

  ncr_mojaveforts:0 "Mojave Fortification"
  ncr_mojaveforts_desc:0 "Caesar may have been beaten once, but he'll almost certainly be back! Yet when he comes, he'll find the Mojave a far tougher nut to crack, as we have set about fortifying key positions for his inevitable return. He shall find the men and women of the NCR waiting for him, and his barbarian Legion."

  ncr_urbandraft:0 "The Urban Draft"
  ncr_urbandraft_desc:0 "The majority of the men and women that serve in the NCR's military are farmers, sons, daughters, volunteers, and criminals forced into service. Yet with the threat of the Legion hanging over us, now the common man must be called to arms. Men and women from the NCR's cities are now being called to serve."

  ncr_powertopeople:0 "Power to the People"
  ncr_powertopeople_desc:0 "The NCR's control over Hoover Dam is an advantage that can not be understated, for even now landlines are being established between it and Shady Sands. This massive undertaking will eventually help to relieve the energy requirements for one of the largest cities on earth, and supply us with a healthy surplus."

  ncr_heavytroops:0 "The New Heavy Corps"
  ncr_heavytroops_desc:  "It is firmly believed by the higher ups that the best chance and bet we have at defeating the Legion comes in our technological advantages, which must be pushed to their limits if we are to again come into conflict with Caesar. To this end, a new corps of power armoured warriors are being formed and outfitted."

  ncr_hardline:0 "The New Hardline"
  ncr_hardline_desc:0 "The bear has been awoken, and now she comes. Let there be retribution for the fallen, the enslaved, and those too weak to stand up for themselves. Let there be hope for the future, the forgotten, and the downtrodden. Let there be victory for the people of the Mojave, mankind, and the New California Republic! Caesar, we come for you, not only because we will it, but because we must."

  ncr_integration:0 "The Baja Integration Act"
  ncr_integration_desc:0 "The political masterpiece of Grant C. Hayes is the Baja integration act, the formal creation of an official NCR state under a reformed bandito council. All parties are willing to sign, although the terms of rejection are incredibly simply, and it would require only a minor offence to send all of this to ruin. Yet who would benefit from that though?"

  ncr_mayorvictory:0 "Mayoral Victory Speech"
  ncr_mayorvictory_desc:0 "The Victory Speech of one Grant C. Hayes was broadcast over the radio to all of the NCR this morning. In his thirty minute speech, Grant outlined his plans for the city and the NCR at large. He believes in a future based in the past, the restoration of mighty cities, and the reclamation of technology and liberty from other forces within California and beyond!"

  ncr_thepeople:0 "The People of Dayglow"
  ncr_thepeople_desc:0 "The city and people of Dayglow are prepared to invest in their future, though it will take time to reach the desired point. Which area of the cities industry is being invested in, and how far or near sighted shall they be."

  ncr_dayglowprospers_desc:0 "Following economic reform and economic revitalization, the city of Dayglow is prospering in ways it hasn't for decades. Hayes promises that this is only the beginning, and that the city shall continue to rise until it is as it was before the war! Prosperous and true."

  ncr_scavunion:0 "Scavengers Union"
  ncr_scavunion_desc:0 "The Scavengers of Dayglow have been the heart of the economy for as long as anyone can remember, and as a reaction to the growth of other industries in the area, they have formed an impromptu union. This has proved to be both beneficial to them and the economy, as a surplus of metal has been made available."

  ncr_migration:0 "Baja Migration"
  ncr_migration_desc:0 "With prosperity comes growth, and with growth comes new faces. Thousands of men and women are attempting to immigrate to Dayglow from the poverty-stricken Baja.

  ncr_supermutants:0 "Super-Mutant Migration"
  ncr_supermutants_desc:0 "Super-Mutants have rights in the NCR, but are rarely welcome. Hayes has advertised Baja as a place where mutants can find freedom and wealth, and good employ. Unfortunately, this message was received in ways he hadn't expected, as hundreds of mutants have now moved into the city. What does one do with so many brutes?"

  ncr_thirteen:0 "Rebuilding the 13"
  ncr_thirteen_desc:0 "The 13 is a name synonymous with pre-war military dockyards, once used by the US Navy to launch numerous assaults on mainland China. Today, it is a ruin of what it once was, picked clean by scavengers, its dockyards lay empty, and its ships rest at the bottom of the harbour. Revitalization of this strategic outpost would be ideal."

  ncr_militport:0 "The Bastion by the Sea"
  ncr_militport_desc:0 "With the port up and running again, the NCR military has elected to establish a permanent garrison in the area, further fortifying the city of Dayglow while also bringing in much need military infrastructure and arms manufacturing to the city."

It is said that this ship shall keep both the coast, and the Colorado River, safe for NCR naval traffic."

  ncr_pitch:0 "The New Pitch"
  ncr_pitch_desc:0 "Grant C. Hayes has had a small obsession with baseball since he played it while growing up in rural Baja. He believes that it could be a viable icon around which to rally while rebuilding the city, and has personally put his own wealth towards the revitalization of an old stadium in the heart of the city."

  ncr_newleague:0 "The League"
  ncr_newleague_desc:0 "Although gathering support has been a challenge, Hayes has begun the process of founding his baseball league.

  ncr_leagueradio:0 "Baseball on the Radio"
  ncr_leagueradio_desc:0 "The NCR is one of the few nations with a fully functional radio system, which broadcasts important information across the waves. Hayes has commandeered these stations for two hours every Sunday, during which he has professional announcers describing the games to all who will listen, mimicking the old ways."

  ncr_firstseason:0 "Season One"
  ncr_firstseason_desc:0 "The First Season of Baseball in California has been an amazing success, with thousands tuning in to listen to and enjoy the games, and heroes being made. Yet one team as risen to absolute fame and glory, the first champions of the first league. Who are they?"

  ncr_calileague:0 "The Californian League"
  ncr_calileague_desc:0 "Now that baseball is back in the eyes of the people of the NCR, the league is founded, and many citizens rally behind it. Stadiums are being built, teams and lesser leagues founded, a little bit of America has returned to the wasteland at last."

  ncr_boneyard:0 "The Boneyard"
  ncr_boneyard_desc:0 "The city of Los Angeles must have been the largest in the world before the War. The Boneyard stretched forever, the skeletons of buildings lying under the hot sun. Not even the wind entered this dead city. Or so it was for a time, yet now LA grows, people and ghouls return to it and with each passing year, it becomes a little less empty and a little more alive."

  ncr_oldcity_desc:0 "The Boneyard was once the greatest cities in all of old America, vast in population and size, and filled to the brim with technology and wonders now lost to time. Yet in the ruins, one can still find wonderful things... what has been uncovered recently?"

  ncr_bearport:0 "The Bearport"
  ncr_bearport_desc:0 "The NCR has been behind on technological innovation for decades, instead relying heavily on its superiority on land. However, in the Boneyard a vast and mostly intact airport has lain dormant for over a century. A new grant for the renewal of this location has been approved by the congress."

  ncr_followers:0 "Funding the Followers"
  ncr_followers_desc:0 "The Followers of the Apocalypse have always done well by the NCR, and it's time that the favour was returned! Volunteers and doctors are being sent to this organization by the dozen, and official funding from the regional Boneyard promises to grow their organization so that it might better help the people of the NCR."

  ncr_bearforceexpansion:0 "Expanding the Bear Force"
  ncr_bearforceexpansion_desc:0 "The aptly named Bear Force of the NCR is, among other things, underfunded and lacking in expertise. However, expansion is still something that is being invested in by the NCR, and a reallocation of funding, as well as guidance from a number of pre-war ghouls, should hopefully expand the NCR's capacity to wage war in the skies."

  ncr_flyingbears:0 "When Bears Fly"
  ncr_flyingbears_desc:0 "Despite all odds, the Boneyard's airport has become the gem of the NCR's air force, and has become a hub for the refurbishing and reconstruction of assorted aircraft. It is here that aspiring engineers are trained to rebuild the war machines of old, and it is from here that the NCR's new air fleet shall launch."

  ncr_boneyardsprawl:0 "The Boneyard Sprawl"
  ncr_boneyardsprawl_desc:0 "In what was once called Lakewood, lies Adytum, one of the most important settlements in the Boneyard. Lakewood used to be in-land before the war, but the nuclear devastation wrought upon the city caused flooding and destruction of the coastline."

  ncr_newcity:0 "Strengthening the New City"
  ncr_newcity_desc:0 "The Boneyard is less a single entity, and more a series of smaller communities that have slowly grown into a rough metropolitan area. As the smaller communities begin to blend together, a new entity, known only as the New City, has begun to emerge."

  ncr_dayglowroads:0 "Roads to Dayglow"
  ncr_dayglowroads_desc:0 "Once, the lands between the Boneyard and Dayglow were a maze of roads and highways, an intricate system that allowed for near ideal trade conditions and travel. Now? They are ruins, filled with uncountable wrecks of vehicles, with almost all old world routes choked to the point of uselessness. The clearance of even one of these lands would do wonders for our infrastructure."
  ncr_gain_dayglow_income:0 "§YDayglow§! gains §G+20%§! Development and Trade income"

  ncr_mint:0 "The Republic Reserve"
  ncr_mint_desc:0 "The stockpile of all gold and wealth in the NCR is located in the Boneyard, and the current Treasurer of the Republic and head of the Republic Reserve is John Michael Henderton; whose signature can be found on the front face of all NCR notes."

  ncr_scavfund:0 "Funding Scavengers"
  ncr_scavfund_desc:0 "Scavengers have and continue to be the heart of the Boneyard's economy, a small army of men and women who go forth into the ruins of the old world and return with metal and other useful resources. The continued operation of these groups, and their expansion, is key to our economic plan."

  ncr_grinvestments:0 "Gun Runner Investments"
  ncr_grinvestments_desc:0 "The Gun Runners of the Boneyard are among the best weaponsmiths in all of the world, and certainly they are the most powerful and successful within the NCR. Capable of reproducing all but the rarest of pre-war designs, and on a scale that is suitable for the NCR's military."

  ncr_grexpansion:0 "Gun Runner Expansion"
  ncr_grexpansion_desc:0 "The Gun Runner Expansion is a generous donation from the NCR's military budget, intended to be put towards a large scale expansion of the Gun Runners facilities, so that they might better arm the NCR troops as the push towards standardization is made."

  ncr_allisgoodboneyard:0 "All is good in the Boneyard"
  ncr_allisgoodboneyard_desc:0 "Under the leadership of Allgood Murphy, the Boneyard has flourished in ways that were previously unthinkable. It has become a beacon of progress within the NCR, and to a lesser extent, the wasteland on the whole."

  ncr_barons:0 "Barons of the NCR"
  ncr_barons_desc:0 "The NCR's economy is vast and powerful, but there are growing concerns about the assorted Barons and their monopolies on various aspects of the economy. From Brahmin to water, all precious resources are controlled by only a handful of men. Yet when these men work together, their political and economic sway can make miracles happen in unlikely places."

  ncr_sac:0 "Sac City Reborn"
  ncr_sac_desc:0 "Sac-Town was once the former capital of California before the bombs fell, and not long after that, it became a bastion for raiders and tribals, notably the 80's. However, town was never a proper term for such a place, and the NCR has made strives to establish the location as an economic hub, their northernmost city of importance."

  ncr_hub:0 "The Hub Prospers"
  ncr_hub_desc:0 "The Hub is an enormous trading centre and settlement established in an old town relatively untouched by the Great War. Caravans are organized here, carrying goods north to Shady Sands, Junktown, the Mojave Wasteland, and south to the Boneyard."

  ncr_junktown:0 "Junktown Flourishes"
  ncr_junktown_desc:0 "Junktown is one of the smaller towns in southern California. It was founded shortly after the War by a soldier named Darkwater. Instead of building on the ruins of an old town, he thought it would be better to begin from the ground up. Since becoming a state of the NCR, Junktown has gained notable economic prosperity and growth, due in part to it being the hub of what little trade the NCR has with the Brotherhood of Steel."

  ncr_80sgarage:0 "The 80's Garages"
  ncr_80sgarage_desc:0 "The 80's Tribe were once among the most powerful raider gangs in all of California, ritual preservationists who maintained their motorbikes with superstitious attention and care. However, the 80's were little match for the NCR military that later pushed them out from their homelands, and to this day, their numerous garages and temples lay mostly untouched, as do the secrets contained within them."

  ncr_baroninvest:0 "Baron Investment Opportunities"
  ncr_baroninvest_desc:0 "The economic power of the Baron's can't be understated, and while they often feud, when their minds are put to a task, they can accomplish almost anything within reason. Be it the forced takeover of criminal assets, the corruption of the local police force, or a simple aggressive acquisition of all local competitors."

  ncr_longroadhome:0 "The Long Road Home"
  ncr_longroadhome_desc:0 "Roads are the heart of any successful trade route, and for the longest time Sac City has lacked a singular, reliable route to its outlying settlements and to the capital itself. This is easy to remedy, and shall be remedied, it only requires a handful of bribes and an absolutely legitimate acquisition of bulk concrete from Reno."

  ncr_crimsoncaravan:0 "Crimson Caravan HQ"
  ncr_crimsoncaravan_desc:0 "Crimson Caravan is the largest caravan outfit in New California, and quite probably the entire Wasteland. The Crimson Caravan Company is one of the largest suppliers of the NCR's military-grade weaponry, and an assortment of provisions and other equipment types. As they flourish, the entire economy is uplifted, so is it not best to give them a helping hand?"

  ncr_hubcrime:0 "Crime in the Hub"
  ncr_hubcrime_desc:0 "The crime in the hub has been a concern for decades, with NCR officials often trying to crack down on it and bring it to an end. It holds up the economy in many ways, yet the Baron's understand better than most that in many ways, it is the heart of the Hub's economy. Weapons, drugs, and all sorts of illegal activities keep the Hub competitive. What they decide to do with it will change much about the city."

  ncr_richroad:0 "The Rich Roads"
  ncr_richroad_desc:0 "As ever, the heart of the NCR is Shady Sands, and the establishment of a system of roads connecting any township to it will bring in both wealth and prosperity. To this end, the Barons seek to improve upon and perfect the trade routes that currently connect the Hub to the capital, so that their investments might flourish."

  ncr_gizmo:0 "Gizmo's Legacy"
  ncr_gizmo_desc:0 "Gizmo was once the most powerful man in all of Junktown, a vile criminal who unintentionally propped the fledgling township up for greatness with his activities and dastardly business practices. Although reviled by many of Junktown's citizens, the Brahmin Baron's look favourably upon Gizmo's legacy, and continue to engage in many of the practices that made him powerful and wealthy."

  ncr_doctormorbid:0 "Doctor Morbid's School of Medicine"
  ncr_doctormorbid_desc:0 "Doctor Morbid's School of Medicine is the legacy of the somewhat infamous Doctor Morbid, a morally questionable practitioner of medicine who made use of his monopoly on the medical trade to charge outrageous prices and fund his numerous other projects, among them the institution."

  ncr_newwall:0 "The New Wall"
  ncr_newwall_desc:0 "Junktown has always had an iconic aesthetic, a budding city ringed with numerous walls made from ancient vehicles and wrecks. Every few decades, another layer is added to contain the ever expanding population, and it is time that the newest outer sprawl be brought within the confines of this layered defence."

  ncr_bearsroar:0 "The Bear Roars"
  ncr_bearsroar_desc:0 "The NCR's military is the strongest in all of the wasteland, tens of thousands of men and women who are both well equipped and reasonably drilled. These men and women are backed up by a dedicated and capable logistics core, the supreme talent and skill of the Rangers, and an undeniable dedication to civilization in the wasteland. When the Bear Roars, the wasteland trembles."

  ncr_standardarms:0 "Weapon Standardization"
  ncr_standardarms_desc:0 "The NCR has been having certain issues with equipping its infantry, not due to a lack of firearms, but due to an overwhelming variety. Numerous small manufacturers produce innumerable weapons for the NCR, some of which take different ammunition or break after brief amounts of use. This inconsistency has caused hell for our forces in the field."

  ncr_grdeals:0 "Gun Runner Deal "
  ncr_grdeals_desc:0 "The group most suited to aiding in the standardization of the NCR's military equipment would have to be the gun runners, who pride overt quality and standards above any other group in the wasteland. By paying the Gun Runners to send experts to oversee weapon manufacturing across the wasteland, we should be able to increase the quality of our weapons in general."

  ncr_grliscense:0 "Gun Runner Licensing"
  ncr_grliscense_desc:0 "The Gun Runners have quickly proven themselves as the superior weaponsmiths in the wasteland, and more so, our recent efforts to fund them have put them into a position where they can sustain a far greater output in a reliable way. Efforts are already being made in congress to make them the sole provider of firearms to the NCR's military, we need only approve this motion."

  ncr_drummond1:0 "Drummond's Army "
  ncr_drummond1_desc:0 "Alexander Drummond is obsessed with the armies of the old world, and has spent much of his long life studying the tactics of the old world. The unification of arms and overeager integration of transport vehicles, artillery and the overwhelming firepower of tanks. Drummond dreams of an NCR military that has the tools to deal with any foe."

  ncr_blast:0 "Blast from the Past"
  ncr_blast_desc:0 "The cannon revolutionized warfare, rewriting the playbook time and time again. It seems that the wasteland has forgotten the cannon, for so many nations forgo its usage. However, the NCR is in a unique position to gather and make use of such weapons; something Drummond fully intends to do."

  ncr_mobile:0 "Army of Mobility "
  ncr_mobile_desc:0 "The ability to move troops and supplies from place to place is a key feature in any army, and while the NCR has some capacity to do this, it is currently treated as an afterthought to be used in choice situations, rather than as an element of core NCR doctrine. This must be remedied if the NCR is to push forward militarily."

  ncr_spear:0 "The Tip of the Spear "
  ncr_spear_desc:0 "Drummond has spent decades collecting information from scattered libraries and military installations, exploring the usage of the now elusive tank through the ages. Warfare in the wasteland, and the limited volume of tanks has made the vast majority of these tactics invalid, yet it has also given Drummond the insight needed to formulate his own new doctrine of vehicular warfare."

  ncr_jim:0 "Big Jim's Army "
  ncr_jim_desc:0 "Big Jim is not a particularly complicated man when it comes to tactic, he values bravery and loyalty in his troops above any particular strategy or methodology. In many ways, this makes Big Jim's army overwhelmingly inflexible, but at the end of the day? The introduction of simple drills once taught to him by the Desert Ranger should allow the NCR's average soldier to rise to new heights."

  ncr_drills:0 "Infantry Drills"
  ncr_drills_desc:0 "As odd as it may seem, one of the first things the Big Jim elected to do after being appoint as leader of the NCR's military was to reinvent the wheel when it came to their incredibly rudimentary infantry drills. The integration of simple squad tactics and more complicated marksmanship and urban assault tactics should have a marked improvement on the average soldier in the NCR's Military."

  ncr_march:0 "Military March "
  ncr_march_desc:0 "The marching drills of Big Jim have been met with resounding frustration from the average soldier, who loathes the idea of marching for days on end even after one has met the physical requirements. The point of these exercises is to increase the overall mobility of infantry as a unit, rather than individuals. This standardization of mobility and increased mileage on foot soldiers is a general boon."

  ncr_draft:0 "The Big Jim Draft"
  ncr_draft_desc:0 "The Big Jim Draft is something few people actually expected to see, as many in the NCR feel that conscription is one of the leading issues in relation to the quality of the NCR's military forces, yet as Jim's doctrine stresses the importance of overwhelming numbers of high quality infantry, the need to enlist more men and women, willing or otherwise, is a necessity."

  ncr_olivers_pet_project:0 "Oliver's Pet Project"
  ncr_olivers_pet_project_desc:0 "Oliver always figured that NCR Heavy Troopers could play a pivotal role in the fighting in Arizona. If we were to conquer a Brotherhood outpost we could begin deconstructing old sets of power armour to figure out how they work!"

  ncr_rangergenmossman:0 "Mossman's Army"
  ncr_rangergenmossman_desc:0 "Ranger General Mossman has something of a disdain for the average soldier in the NCR, and views them as an awkward, blunt tool, better for pinning an enemy down than actually accomplishing anything in particular. To this end, he believes in the expansion and increased importance of the Rangers, and instead puts much of his funding towards improving them."

  ncr_rangercore:0 "The New Ranger Corps"
  ncr_rangercore_desc:0 "The increased funding, diverted from that usually given to the NCR's common army, has had a notable impact on the Rangers in general. Superior facilities and the lion's share of able bodied recruits has enabled them to grow in number and quality, with propaganda stating again and again that the Ranger Corps has never been stronger."

  ncr_rangerlead:0 "Rangers Lead the Way"
  ncr_rangerlead_desc:0 "Rangers are, above all other things, special forces capable of infiltration and reconnaissance. Ranger General Mossman employs a relatively simple approach to large scale engagement, one that involves using rangers to scout ahead of a main body of infantry in order to assess the ideal location for an engagement and to counter any and all moves an enemy might make."

  ncr_rangercanopeners:0 "Ranger Can-Openers"
  ncr_rangercanopeners_desc:0 "Ranger General Mossman, like many within the NCR Rangers, feel that the Brotherhood of Steel are easily the most dangerous threat that the NCR faces to this date, a thorn in the side of the republic who use their advanced technology to bully the commonfolk of the NCR. To this end, special drills and tactics are being developed by the Rangers, informally referred to as can opener techniques."

  ncr_mechcore:0 "Mechanized Corps"
  ncr_mechcore_desc:0 "The NCR is one of the few nations in the world capable of sustaining a sizeable fleet of support vehicles and motorized support. While these vehicles fill a largely logistical role, on rare occasion one can find these divisions risked on daring envelopment techniques against the NCR's more slippery foes."

  ncr_shock:0 "Shock Companies"
  ncr_shock_desc:0 "The introduction of the APC to the NCR's military could be a game-changer in wars against more powerful foes, such as the Legion or the Brotherhood of Steel. To this end, the mass production of vehicles for so called 'shock battalions' has become a priority for those in the highest echelons of military command."

  ncr_rapid:0 "Rapid Advance Doctrine"
  ncr_rapid_desc:0 "The Motorized corps of the NCR is in many ways, a separate entity to the army itself. It shares few commanders and has incompatible tactics and strategies when in battle. The improved integration of these forces and a greater unity in tactics could allow the NCR to make better use of this valuable strategic advantage."

  ncr_rapid2:0 "The True Rapids"
  ncr_rapid2_desc:0 "Don't let the tribals fool you, we will head into enemy territory directly."

  ncr_reorganizetheexpeditionaries:0 "Reorganize the Expeditionary Forces"
  ncr_reorganizetheexpeditionaries_desc:0 "With our recent expansion into the Mojave, the NCR's expeditionary branch of the army is war weary, under supplied, and regarded as an unpopular posting within the Military. Signing off new funds for equipment, recruiting, and morale would do well to boost their status."

  ncr_rapidannexation:0 "Rapid Annexation"
  ncr_rapidannexation_desc:0 "Across the Colorado River lies Caesar's Legion, a rapidly expanding nation with a penchant for absorbing and annexing independent tribes. On our side of the Colorado lies the Rapids, a sternly independent tribe that runs from Los Algodones all the way up to Tumblehome. Were the legion to cross in the south and attack them, our Heartlands would be exposed, thus we must take matters into our own hands and annex the Rapids. "

  ncr_rapidsettlement:0 "Rapid Settlement"
  ncr_rapidsettlement_desc:0 "Now that the Rapids has been pacified, we should invest settlers and farmers into the area to strengthen our hold on the territory. It will be costly in both manpower and industry, but in the end we should have a firm grasp on the area."

  ncr_expandthefrontier:0 "Expand the Frontier"
  ncr_expandthefrontier_desc:0 "The Umbra tribe have been raiding our caravans travelling along the northern banks of California for some time. We should put them in their place and penalize them for harming NCR citizens."

  ncr_settlethenorth:0 "Settle the North"
  ncr_settlethenorth_desc:0 "There are a slew of poorly defended cities on our North and North-western borders, if we acted fast we could seize them from their unsuspecting owners without rising a full on war with them."

  ncr_baja_victory:0 "The Spoils of Baja"
  ncr_baja_victory_desc:0 "With the Baja campaign turning out to be a grand victory for the Republic our citizens can rest easy that they will not be attacked in the night by roaming bandits."

  ncr_settlethewest:0 "Treaty with San Francisco"
  ncr_settlethewest_desc:0 "The Shi have been a stalwart ally of the NCR for some time now - helping the Republic in its early years fight off old world raiders and criminals. Perhaps its time we solidify our cultural exchange program into a treaty?"

  ncr_purchasescrapheapandkettle:0 "Negotiate for Scrapheap and Teakettle"
  ncr_purchasescrapheapandkettle_desc:0 "The Ranger state is one constantly mired in warfare with surrounding gangs and tribes, with little to produce and much of their budget going towards the military, they may be willing to sell a few of their territories for caps..."

  ncr_opentheeasternroute:0 "Open up the Eastern Route"
  ncr_opentheeasternroute_desc:0 "The route through Mountain Springs and Mountain Springs could make for a major trading and supply route, but at the current moment the settlers inhabiting the Divide have block all of our attempts to move materials into the Mojave. This cannot stand."

  ncr_developtheeasternroute:0 "Develop the Eastern Route"
  ncr_developtheeasternroute_desc:0 "Now that we've pacified Mountain Springs and have access to the trade route, we can go about laying down infrastructure and digging wells. This will both endear the local population to us, and make transportation of goods easier."

  ncr_fortifytheeasternroute:0 "Fortify the Eastern Route"
  ncr_fortifytheeasternroute_desc:0 "The now thriving Eastern route into the Mojave will almost certainly make for a tempting target for parties that wish to undermine our place in the Mojave, we should seek to fortify our side of the route."

  ncr_fundcrimsoncaravan:0 "Fund the Mojave Crimson Caravan"
  ncr_fundcrimsoncaravan_desc:0 "With an increase in supply and easier access to the Mojave, various firms have shown interest in opening offices in the frontier. The Crimson Caravan is one of them, with a bit of funding we could prop up their efforts."

  ncr_manifestdestiny:0 "Manifest Destiny Realized"
  ncr_manifestdestiny_desc:0 "The Old World idea of Manifest Destiny, that our nation is so great in it's ideals and practice that surely it should spread as far as the continent will let it, is an idea we can capitalize on by hoisting our recent frontier successes into the spotlight."

  ncr_return_to_mojave:0 "Memories of the Mojave"
  ncr_return_to_mojave_desc:0 "The Mojave Expeditionary Force was driven out of the Mojave, but we will not give up. With the destruction of the Brotherhood of Steel, it's time to show those who wronged us that you don't tread on the Bear!"
  ncr_fight_caesar:0 "The West Will Never Fall"
  ncr_fight_caesar_desc:0 "We aren't impressed by the tyrants who hold sway east of the Colorado. They plot and scheme to seize the lands of the NCR. But we are the torch of the Pacific; watch us burn."
