  ach_nf_consolidation:0 "Brotherhood Consolidation"
  ach_nf_consolidation_desc:0 "Building a new Brotherhood Chapter is no easy task. Although many of our forefather’s strategies and organization will remain the same, we’ll still face difficulty adapting to our new situation."
  ach_nf_technological_recovery:0 "Technological Recovery"
  ach_nf_technological_recovery_desc:0 "Now that we’ve disposed of Rusk’s impossible goal of peacekeeping we can return to our roots. Our efforts will refocus on search and recovery teams scavenging or seizing any advanced weaponry they find."
  ach_nf_demand_richmond:0 "Demand Richmond"
  ach_nf_demand_richmond_desc:0 "Our split put the Texan Brotherhood into disarray, meaning now is the time to press our demands. Richmond would cut off their direct access to the Gulf along with further empowering our industrial base."
  ach_nf_houston_communications:0 "Houston Space Center"
  ach_nf_houston_communications_desc:0 "Next, we have to strike a deal with Houston. Weak and decaying, we’ll demand access to their territory in order to use their technology to contact the Western Brotherhood."
  ach_nf_contact_west:0 "The Chains that Bind"
  ach_nf_contact_west_desc:0 "Since forever has this piece of our doctrine guided us. Commands flow from top to bottom, an unbroken chain that makes us hard as steel. Unquestioning loyalty to the elder included. Let us try to find our elders. Contact west must be established."
  ach_nf_boost_the_signal:0 "Boost the Signal"
  ach_nf_boost_the_signal_desc:0 "Houston's decay has done us no favors. Their space center, as useful as it is, has nowhere near the power needed to reach the Western Brotherhood."
  ach_nf_fix_arrays:0 "Attempt Repairs"
  ach_nf_fix_arrays_desc:0 "What equipment they do have is unreliable, at best. Repairs should be next on our list of priorities."
  ach_nf_boost_the_signal_2:0 "Powering the Capacitors"
  ach_nf_boost_the_signal_2_desc:0 "The problem seems to be twofold. Failing equipment is compounded by a lack of adequate power, which we'll address next."
  ach_nf_fix_arrays_2:0 "Assign More Engineers"
  ach_nf_fix_arrays_2_desc:0 "We can't afford to delay any longer. We'll reassign most of our engineers to the space center to rapidly increase the project's progress."

  ach_nf_emergency_draft:0 "Emergency Draft"
  ach_nf_emergency_draft_desc:0 "Most of our supporters are a small number of high-ranking Brotherhood officers. The general population is largely uncaring to our plight, meaning we'll need to forcibly conscript them for our cause."
  ach_nf_military_upgrades:0 "Emergency Production"
  ach_nf_military_upgrades_desc:0 "Our industrial capacity is nowhere near our rivals'. Extending working hours and encouraging workshop jobs will help ease this disparity."

  ach_nf_yeomen:0 "Brotherhood Yeomen"
  ach_nf_yeomen_desc:0 "Every man and woman shall do their duty for the Brotherhood. The Yeomen, are a novel concept. Not quite fully fledged members, but still adorned with priviledges and protection. So many would give up their autonomy for our protection, and if we can wield them like a sword? We shall."
  ach_nf_robot_production:0 "Brotherhood Robots"
  ach_nf_robot_production_desc:0 "We don't traditionally integrate robots into our armies, but they've seemed to work well for our enemies. It may be worthwhile to investigate their utility, if nothing else."
  ach_nf_circuit_breakers:0 "Circuit Breakers"
  ach_nf_circuit_breakers_desc:0 "Robots have their advantages, but they aren't invincible. Our advanced technology already grants advantages against them, but there's little reason not to compound that power further. Let Anna come, we will not be found wanting."
  ach_nf_warmongering_mutants:0 "Mutant Menace"
  ach_nf_warmongering_mutants_desc:0 "Our oldest enemy rises again. These abominations are crimes against nature itself, against the sanctity of human life, and we'll happily do our duty by putting them down."
  ach_nf_workshop_forges:0 "Brotherhood Forges"

  ach_nf_scribes:0 "Brotherhood Scribes"
  ach_nf_scribes_desc:0 "A vast majority of scribes from the Texan Brotherhood were sympathetic to our cause. Of course, they have demands of their own, meaning that to appease them we’ll need to spend time investing into our research and development teams."
  ach_nf_study_codex:0 "Codex Studies"
  ach_nf_study_codex_desc:0 "A key failing of the Texan Brotherhood was their stray from Codex-inspired tactics. A return to our doctrinal roots will no doubt help purify our integrity as a Brotherhood chapter."
  ach_nf_study_codex_2:0 "Constructive Applications"
  ach_nf_study_codex_2_desc:0 "Melding Codex doctrine with operational reality has never been an easy task. Nevertheless, Törni’s experience in the Circle of Steel makes her the perfect woman for the job."
  ach_nf_study_guns:0 "Weaponry Studies"
  ach_nf_study_guns_desc:0 "Quality weapons are the backbone of every competent army. For all our advanced technology, there’s still more to be learned."
  ach_nf_study_guns_2:0 "Advanced Fireteam Integration"
  ach_nf_study_guns_2_desc:0 "The best weapons mean little if our troops have no training on how to use them. Field exercises might even spur further research, as it allows our scribes to step out of their laboratories and observe the practical effects of their work."
  ach_nf_study_armor:0 "The Paladin's Skin"
  ach_nf_study_armor_desc:0 "Every Paladin with Power Armor is a Paladin safe from harm. The safety of our soldiers has always been a top concern. Encouraging further research into Power Armor safety measures will improve their survivability manyfold."
  ach_nf_study_armor_2:0 "Specialized Refinements"
  ach_nf_study_armor_2_desc:0 "The bulky nature of Power Armor creates a never-ending arms race between ourselves and our enemies. While they struggle to create weapons strong enough to pierce our armor we strive to outdo their most lethal round."
  ach_nf_study_aviation:0 "The Air is a Battlefield"
  ach_nf_study_aviation_desc:0 "Before the Great War the most powerful nations understood that the sky itself was a battlefield. The high cost of an effective airforce is unsustainable for many groups today, but not for us."
  ach_nf_study_aviation_fighter:0 "Aces in our Sleeve"
  ach_nf_study_aviation_fighter_desc:0 "Fighter planes offer the best opportunity for our best pilots to shine. Their maneuverability and air combat focus allow for massive skill gaps between two pilots, making extensive training all the more crucial."
  ach_nf_study_aviation_cas:0 "Death From Above"

  ach_nf_study_air_tactics:0 "Unusual Takeaways"
  ach_nf_study_air_tactics_desc:0 "It may seem odd that we believe the Codex’s doctrines are applicable to air warfare. Yet, we recognize the Codex’s ideas as the underlying truths of all warfare, no matter where it may take place."
  ach_nf_scribes_2:0 "Seasoned Scribes"
  ach_nf_scribes_2_desc:0 "Our research has progressed exponentially since we split from the Texans. Nearly all of our scribes are now veteran innovators, each capable of advancing our technology much further than before."

  ach_nf_arm_comes_desc:0 "History is doomed to repeat itself, after all. While the robot general rallies his forces we’ll prepare ours. Texan against Mexican, human against machine, victory will be ours!"
  ach_nf_tex_comes:0 "Texas Comes"
  ach_nf_tex_comes_desc:0 "We’ve expected an attack from the north since we split, making this more of a formality. Still it hurts to see former brothers be consumed in their frantic desire to restore what once was. Pride, arrogance and the belief that they can shape a better future, while trampling our bones. It’s time to defend the Brotherhood from those all those who threaten our mission, whatever the cost may be."
  ach_nf_bunker_grid:0 "Bunker Grid"
  ach_nf_bunker_grid_desc:0 "A smaller pool of manpower requires a strong defensive strategy. A network of outposts will allow for constant communication on enemy offensives and strategies."
  fortify_alamo_tooltip:0 "4 §YOutposts§! will be built on §YThe Alamo§!.\n2 §YOutposts§! will be built along the borders of §YSan Antonio§!, §YNixontown§!, §YThe Corpse§!, §YColumbus§!, §YPort Lavaca§!, and §YRichmond§! if we control them."

  ach_nf_desperate_defense:0 "Desperate Defense"
  ach_nf_desperate_defense_desc:0 "For all our might, numbers speak louder than words. Circumventing our enemies’ advantages will necessitate fighting for every street corner. If they do not know when we fight, they will not be ready."

  ach_nf_treasures_of_the_old_world_desc:0 "There's always plenty of lost technology in the various ruins around us. Beginning a series of expeditions into these areas will no doubt lead to significant rewards. After all is this not our ultimate purpose? Safeguarding what could destroy humanity?"

  ach_nf_airfield_2:0 "Alamo to the Skies"
  ach_nf_airfield_2_desc:0 "Any brother that fights in the sky, is a safe brother. From that safety they can provide it for those below as well. The more we rule the skies, the safer we will be."

  ach_nf_air_defenses_desc:0 "Get out of here, plane!"

  ach_nf_enter_the_corpse:0 "Enter the Corpse"
  ach_nf_enter_the_corpse_desc:0 "Corpus Christi, pre war military installation, filled with who knows what. Ancient secrets to discover, perhaps the power to rule the seas? None shall be allowed to wield this, for the good of humanity. None but us."
  ach_nf_enter_the_corpse_2:0 "Corpus Christi"
  ach_nf_enter_the_corpse_2_desc:0 "After all our preparations, the Corpse now looms before us. The stench of death and mutation echoes from these ruins, disturbing even our most veteran Paladins. Though we have taken it apart, unlocked it's secrets. Ancient naval documents, blueprints, and the knowledge to build ships, stronger, better and faster than ever before."
  ach_nf_secrets_of_fort_hood:0 "Secrets of Fort Hood"
  ach_nf_secrets_of_fort_hood_desc:0 "The Fort Hood military installation was a key arms depot before the war. Experimental, and conventional alike. Our first expedition here ended in failure and little progress, but our new Elder is sure she can manage this. Or perhaps it is simply her stubbornness and a desire to justify those casulties the base has already caused?"
  ach_nf_secrets_of_fort_hood_electronics:0 "Hacking Focus"
  ach_nf_secrets_of_fort_hood_electronics_desc:0 "High-tech security comes naturally with these expeditions. Training on how to deal with these systems will greatly facilitate our work and prepare the necessary security codes to accelerate our progress into the depths of Fort Hood."
  ach_nf_secrets_of_fort_hood_readiness:0 "Expedition Focus"
  ach_nf_secrets_of_fort_hood_readiness_desc:0 "One word, Manpower. Expeditions are costly, and not seldom require life. If we throw more into the breach, it might buckle sooner and give way so we can progress."

  ach_nf_secrets_houston_satelite_air_focus_desc:0 "Satellites, Satellites everywhere. And we have access to many, although with the time and effort required to crack the codes, we might only be able to focus on one kind. Should we focus on weather monitoring? Or orbital surveilance"

  ach_nf_poseidon_oil_iff_desc:0 "All of these military compounds had something in common, something rather unusual. Or at least unusual to those who are aware of the dark days before the war. Still, why would an energy company be so interested in pre war military bases?"
