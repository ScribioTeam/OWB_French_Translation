  nf_tvt.1.d:0 "§R\"What’s Wrong?\"§! The familiar, controlling voice spoke out from behind the cabinet as 40011 pulled the door open.\nThe Director's distinguished voice could be heard in every cabinet, every corner, and every home. It was something that had become second nature to everyone here.\n\n§B\"I'm giving you another chance to put an end to this Carousel. I've already run away a hundred times from this prison.\nThere's no reason why I can't run a hundred more.\"§! 40011 spoke out, a demand she gave the Director each and every time she ran.\n\nThe voice of the all-seeing, all-knowing Director responded by reiterating his aged position, which he has maintained for as long as anyone can remember.\n§R\"You know I won’t do that 40011. I’ve told you before - this show has a purpose, you just aren’t ready to know it yet.\nThe show must go on, running won’t stop it, nothing can.\n\nQuestion; Why do you keep running, even after so many unsuccessful attempts?\"§!\n\n§B\"Why? Its for the chance to be part of something bigger than I ever dreamed of!\nTo be part of something more then this stupid fucking show! I don't want to be a house wife! I want my life to mean something!\nI am not turning back now!\"§! 40011 spoke in a confident, cocky tone against the toneless Director as she closed the cabinet door.\n\nShe was about to run again."
  nf_tvt.1.a: "That thing has to go, I swear."
  nf_tvt_1.e: "This isn’t the first time §Y40011§! has spoken with §RThe Director§!, and it won’t be her last. Like anyone, she yearns for freedom.\n\n"

  nf_tvt.2.d: "40011 looked on as the door closed, the mirror showing her face.\nShe was, of course, still herself.\nAn android.\nShe didn’t know what that meant, she knew she wasn’t always an android, she was something else before, something simpler.\n\nPorcelain skin, circuited blood, jointed fingers and a two-channel voice was what she was now.\n\nBeing an android was not unusual to 40011; in fact, everyone in TV-Town was an android - with hands that could crush steel, heels attached to jet-boosters for controlled flight and eyes installed with thermal disintegration rays.\n\nNobody seemed to find anything wrong with it; it's just the way of things."
  nf_tvt.2.a: "Looking sharp, 40011.\nYou can do this."
  nf_tvt.2.e: "§Y40011§! had told herself those words the last twenty times she had tried to escape.\n\n"

  nf_tvt.3.t: "$nf_tvt_3_title$"
  nf_tvt.3.d: "40011 knew that there had to be more to this world than this show. It’s why she was a runner.\n\nAccording to the Director there was nothing else to this world besides the show. To live in TV Town means you have to play in the show, and to play in the show means you have to do what the Director wants of you.\nThe show was §BCarousel§!, a slice of suburban life in the suburban little neighbourhood of TV-Town. A little walled neighbourhood tucked into the middle of nowhere. If 40011 was to play her role she would be going to work today as a tour guide at the local national history museum.\nIt’s been some years since she had given a tour, 40011 having long abandoned her post in order to uncover the truth of TV Town and free the people here from this looped, simple life.\nit was the mission of every runner, before and forever.\n\nEven still, as she left her home 40011's neighbour, 81998 waved in a friendly way as she tended her garden.\n\"Heading out to work again? Good luck! Tonight I am having Salisbury Steak with my family over dinner, come and join us when you get back!""
  nf_tvt.3.a: "Please don’t wait for me, it will be a while!"
  nf_tvt.3.e: "Steak sounded good, but §Y40011§! had a mission tonight.\n§GShe was going to do it this time!§!"

  nf_tvt_sandman.1.d: "As 40011 stepped away from her home, she was stopped briefly by a familiar face.\n\nThe Dreaded "Sandman", SRC 10031.\n\nWhatever hate 40011 had of the Director was twice fold for the Sandman. It was the Sandman that always - like a hunter's tracking hound - chased down Runners trying to escape §BCarousel§!.\n"Good morning 40011, just checking to make sure you aren't acting up today. Heading to work, I hope?""
  nf_tvt_sandman.1.a: "\"You know it!\""
