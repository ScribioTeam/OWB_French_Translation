  MTR_rail_riders_desc:0 "The Mad Trains are more a loose coalition of related families than a united force, with each of those clans based on one of the great pre-war train engines that still roam the rails. Those engines are individual in more than one way, as they all contain a unique AI that act as the driver for each train. This has made for a diverse group of peoples with many ways of solving problems but as many differing opinions on what is a problem."
  RMT_four_forefathers:0 "The Four Fathers"
  RMT_four_forefathers_desc:0 "Our predecessors built monuments to the Four Fathers, structures we can never hope to exceed. But they also turned their backs on what the Four Fathers stood for and were in turn blindsided by nuclear fire. In their mercy we have been given a second chance as our tribe is headed by the avatars of their teachings. \n\nWe must §Rreclaim§! §4Mount Rushmore§! before we lose the gods' favor a second time."
  LAP_preemptive_militarization:0 "Preemptive Militarization"
  LAP_preemptive_militarization_desc:0 "In the west, just beyond our borders, is a land prime to explode. We can't be caught by surprise when the endless hordes inevitably awaken and come to consume our people."
  MJW_resolute_pacifists:0 "Resolute Pacifists"
  MJW_resolute_pacifists_desc:0 "Centuries of conflict, both post and pre Great War, have left the land and people scarred beyond measure. War can never be an option to us or our people, nor can it be a reality to our neighbors. Conflict aversion and compromise have gotten us to where we are now and we cannot let a single moment of misjudgement ruin all that humanity has reclaimed from the ashes."
  URA_glowing_crater_ghoul_horde:0 "Glowing Rage"
  URA_glowing_crater_ghoul_horde_desc: "The fleshies that roam the vicinity of Uranium City tell tall tales of our misfortune that paint us as otherworldly demons. Gabba-Ghoul decided to entertain himself and scare away the adventurous tourists by letting loose his horde of glowing ferals that were once contained in the lower bowels of the cistern."

  SNO_nomads_new_north:0 "Braved the Blizzard"
  SNO_nomads_new_north_desc:0 "The freezing cold of Saskatchewan has been known by its people for centuries, but in defeating the Mad Trains and their excuse for an army, our nomads have all become something greater. Wandering the snow-covered wastes has strengthened our resolve beyond imagination. We have truly braved the blizzard, and in turn we have learned its utility. From the hazardous storms of the North we have molded a potent weapon against anyone who dares invade our home."
  MTR_expansive_rail_network:0 "Expansive Rail Network"
  MTR_expansive_rail_network_desc:0 "The Conductor has done the impossible once more. From a loose conglomerate of familial tribes he has fashioned a focused, homogenous clan. With our newly acquired land our infrastructure has grown incredibly robust, a development which has finally put to rest the hostility between our computerized drivers. Riding high-speed rail across the wastes has truly never felt so good."
