  FFI_LAS_TRES_MASCARAS_NAME:0 "Las Tres Mascaras"
  FFI_LAS_TRES_MASCARAS_DESC:0 "When the masked tribes united to fight against the cartels plaguing Los Mochis and the surrounding lands, it was these three who acted as the binding force. Mil Mascaras, the Green Titan, Taker of Masks, the Bullfighter himself, bringing strength and courage to the tribes. The Blue Devil, once a sworn enemy of the tribes, his cunning hit and run tactics and powerful weapons dealing a great blow to the cartel enforcers. And the father of it all, El Santo, Virtuous warrior, Pure of Heart, Mind, And Soul, Bringer of Justice, and Defender of the Weak. It was He who first stood up to the Sinoloa, and it was He who drove the Beltran into the southern jungles. Together they make for an uneasy, if powerful team."
  FFI_MIL_MASCARAS_NAME:0 "Mil Mascaras"
  FFI_MIL_MASCARAS_DESC:0 "Mil Mascaras is a figure shrouded in mystery. Despite his many battles and victories, the Super Mutant remains an enigma, a hero hidden beneath a thousand masks. There are whispers of a past Mil Mascaras wishes he could forget, one spent toiling under the Legion’s whip, a slave revolt ending in tragedy, and a selfless act that would define the man behind the mask."
  FFI_EL_SANTO_NAME:0 "El Santo"
  FFI_EL_SANTO_DESC:0 "Those who fight for a righteous cause with righteous means are the exception in Mexico, America, and perhaps the entire world. El Santo is the exception of exceptions. El Santo saw the rise of the Cartels, how they would tread on all those underneath them, and wept. These tears would become a fire within his heart to one day liberate all those under the boot of the Cartels, and return to the days of peace stolen by evil."
  FFI_DEMONIO_AZUL_NAME:0 "Demonio Azul"
  FFI_DEMONIO_AZUL_DESC:0 "When you are faced with adversity, you have only one task that you owe yourself. An honorable defeat leads nowhere but death and suffering, and El Diablo Azul knows this. He knows the Cartels play by rules that the honorable could not comprehend, and that this would lead only to defeat. His reputation as underhanded and cunning both within the ring and without serves him well, catching his enemy on off-footing."

However, this situation changes when a lone figure in a white mask wanders into town, and dares to challenge the banditos. Despite all odds, the figure drives off the bandidos, only to sucumb to his wounds in the aftermath of the battle.

Despite years of oppression and brutality under the cartels, the saints arrival would go on to inspire a tribal uprising that would shatter the cartel into exile and defeat, but not all would join El Santo's crusade. A warband of tribals refused to accept the saint as savior, adopting the mask and fashioning themselves after the Blue Demon that once challenged El Santo, forcing the saint to share power with Demonio Azul, the ruthless leader of the Blue Demon cult."

Easily defeating several chiefs in single combat, the monster claimed the masks of his defeated foes, establishing himself as the new leader of their tribes.

El Santo and the Blue Demon faced each other in the Los Mochis ring, trading blow for blow. Just as El Santo was to claim victory, from the crowds emerged the Green Giant himself! Mil Mascaras leaped into the ring, and it was only through their combined power that the Blue Demon and El Santo were able to force him to a draw. When the dust had settled on the ruined remains of what had once been the Los Mochis ring, a new fellowship was formed: Las Tres Mascaras would rule the federation as equals, until they faced each other in the ring again."

Traditionally unwilling to work with the Federation, the recent addition of the Blue Demons have opened up unexpected dialogues with the Shadow Walkers, for their patron god is once said to have worked closely with the Blue Demon. The Shadow Walkers are willing to side with the Federation, provided that the Blue Demon Cult push to earn them pardons for the various crimes they have committed in their long history of wars with the Cult of El Santo. While the Cult of the Saints is willing to make some sacrifices, they are unwilling to pardon them all..."

In time honored tradition, the Blue Demon has stepped forward to challenge the Black Shadow, intent on defeating him in a swift and decisive way. Their brawl is unlike most in the Federation, as it makes use of extensive outside equipment and interference, even as both parties wear armour and bring hidden weapons into the fray. When the dust finally settles, the Blue Demon stands triumphant over his foe, and the Black Shadow formally joins the federation… once he recovers from his broken arm."

  nf_ffi.9.d:0 "The Medicinas are, after the followers of El Santo, the most beloved of the Free Fighter tribes in the eyes of the common people under their protection, which is why their refusal to join the federation has caused such turmoil in the lands. The Medicinas worship the long lost Doctor Wagnar, a philanthropist wrestler from long before the war, and follow in his footsteps by offering medical treatments and charity work to those who need it. Among the tribes, they are easily the least interested in aggressive expansion or open conflict with their foes. It can be none other than El Santo who must bridge the gap with this tribe, and stress upon them the importance of protecting others."

After brief discussion, it is agreed that El Santo shall do battle with Doctor Wagnar at a highly publicized and advertised charity event, the gains of which are going to be used to help fund the recently finished hospital. The Conflict between these two can be considered Lucha at its purest, lacking in any underhanded tactics and with numerous moments of incredible respect between the two. The result of this conflict is inevitable however, as Doctor Wagnar is far less a warrior than his contemporary in the heroic El Santo, who ends the match by helping his beaten foe stand."

This match takes place in the center of the Federation’s greatest camp, under the watchful eyes of every chief who has bowed to the federation thus far. Though valiant, even the mighty twins can’t hope to match up to the raw physical might of the supermutant in unarmed combat, and are both defeated when a devastating slam renders one of the brothers unconscious, and the other pinned beneath his massive frame. With their prides firmly checked, the Two Faced Warriors agree to join the federation."

Many in the federation murmur about the foul play, and the grevious wounds that El Santo and Mil Mascaras suffered as a result, but none can deny his victory. Hopefully, the unity of having a sole leader will outweigh any damage in the trust the tribes have in the federation."

The Green Giant is about to retaliate, catching the Demon in a ground slam before El Santo leaps onto his back with a somersault! Fearing a repeat of the first rematch, Mil Mascaras quickly disengages before the Blue Demon reveals his secret weapon, sliding under the ring, he returns to the fray holding a RobCo.
