  mobile_medical_vehicle_tech:0 "Mobile Paramedic Teams"
  mobile_medical_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "As soon as we introduced vehicles into our army structure, and the idea formed around motorizing our support units as well, our medics applied for them first. It should not raise any questions about why should be priority our life-saving units to have the capacity to be on the field ASAP, or why they should be able to carry more equipment than the others."
  mobile_recon_vehicle_tech:0 "Mobile Reconnaissance Corps"
  mobile_recon_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Our reconnaissance units are always ahead of our moving troops, they're in the most immediate danger, and their success and survivability heavily depend on their swiftness. It feels simply natural that in our mobilization effort they will be one of the first corps to have vehicles under them."
  mobile_maintenance_vehicle_tech:0 "Mobile Maintenance Crews"
  mobile_maintenance_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "The more vehicles we plan to use, the more we'll need our maintenance crews. After all, they're who keep them in a working condition, despite all the challenges that the wasteland throws at our equipment; dust storms, radiated fields, or simply the oversized critters. And of course, if we want them to keep the pace with us, they will need their own conveyances too."
  mobile_logistics_vehicle_tech:0 "Mobile Logistical Company"
  mobile_logistics_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Heavy reliance on different forms of cars, motorbikes or even bigger metal beats just complicates, even more, the logistics of our army. We'll need a steady supply of energy cells and various, highly different spare parts for our machines, and if we let our sappers home, we can be sure that something will be left at home. They should be motorized as well - it is only logical."
  
  motorisation_vehicle_tech:0 "Motorisation"
  motorisation_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Advanced study of powerpacks, vehicular infrastructure and a general improvement in restoration of those components will allow us to salvage, repair and refit powered vehicles to equip our infantry divisions with, which should considerably improve the effectiveness and speed of our army. With the power of motorisation does come the benefit of heavier loads. We can now equip our motorized units with a variety of different equipments."

  safety_hatches_vehicle_tech:0 "Tyre Profile"
  safety_hatches_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "By changing the pattern of our tyre's contact surface and adding improvised knobs, we can help our vehicles gain more traction on the sandy and rocky terrain of the desert wasteland, letting them access difficult terrains more easily and gain momentum faster. This will significantly improve the safety of operating our vehicles and reduce casualties from environmental or mechanical factors."
  wet_stowage_vehicle_tech:0 "Wet Stowage"
  wet_stowage_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Ammunition, by its basic function, is made to blow up - just usually, on the enemy, and not in the ammo storage rack. The carried ammunition carries its own vulnerability, and our enemy knows that too well, that's why wet stowage is needed. While we didn't dip our ammo in water pools, they're packed in a specialized rack, where they're separated from each other by small liquid containers - which are mostly filled with water and other chemicals."
  boarding_ramps_vehicle_tech:0 "Rubber Refinement"
  boarding_ramps_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Particular care is to be taken to a multitude of factors for our rubber compounds, such as hardness, external profile, and grip on both the blasted wasteland desert and the new infrastructure we are trying to build. Complimented by thicker tire profile with bulletproof properties, it will allow all of our vehicles to have better speed both on and off road. This will also marginally improve combat performance."
  Compartmentalization_vehicle_tech:0 "Compartmentalization"
  Compartmentalization_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Every vehicle works with a heavily interconnected system under its hoods, as the main motor will inevitably connect to the exhaust system, and by propelling, to the propulsion system. While they need to be connected to a degree, adopting compartmentalization, the separation of especially vulnerable systems from the others, could highly raise the survivability of our vehicles."
  mrap_effort_vehicle_tech:0 "Active Protection System"
  mrap_effort_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "With every new technology comes new ways to abuse said technology, and that statement true for the modern anti-vehicle weapons. They use highly sensitive sensors, which easily interfered with the right electric devices, but there are more rudimentary ways of protecting against these attacks - like shooting down the damm projectile with a mounted weapon, with the right aim-aiding system on board. That's what we call Active Protection."

  plating_vehicle_tech:0 "Plating Addon"
  plating_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Crude, yet effective, making use of the vast number of scrap metal found around the wasteland could reinforce key weak-points in the armor of our vehicles. Protection is increased but take care to keep in mind the weight increase too."
  bumper_vehicle_tech:0 "Impact Bumpers"
  bumper_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Specially-made cowcatchers and other such styles of ram will give our troops the opportunity to partake in some rather unconventional tactics. Expect both a new way to break fortified lines and a higher disobedience rate."
  gasoline_vehicle_tech:0 "Volatile Fuels"
  gasoline_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "It might be best to not question the addictive and mixtures dumped into our fuel supply, but it is indeed effective. Engine roars, and sometimes sadly a bit more than that. It might be best to avoid the maintenance bay for bit while our maintenance crew calm down."
  sealed_vehicle_tech:0 "Environment Sealing"
  sealed_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Entirely sealed hull weldings with air filtration systems and humidification equipment provides our vehicle crew and mobile divisions with a clean, fresh, and revigorating atmosphere to fight and recover in. While this would decrease the speed of our vehicles from the increased power draw and weight, our troops would get back in the fight faster with such upgrades."
  armoured_vehicle_tech:0 "Armour Reinforcement"
  armoured_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "While previous armor upgrades were done only at key critical weak-points to preserve weight, we now have the option to go all-in thanks to improved suspensions and shock absorbers. Treated armor plating and even simple composite armor should keep our motorized and mechanized divisions relevant on the modern battlefield."

  tracks_vehicle_tech_1:0 "Simple Tracks"
  tracks_vehicle_tech_1_desc:0 "Simplified track links and suspension systems is a key element to mass manufacturing of tracked vehicles. Such improvements would reduce vehicle down time, maintenance difficulty and workforce requirement, increasing the general reliability of our tanks."
  tracks_vehicle_tech_2:0 "Return Rollers"
  tracks_vehicle_tech_2_desc:0 "The addition of return rollers to our propulsion system let us keep a constant track tension, leading to less friction between them and the armor plates as well as other propulsion components. Less track replacements and noise as well as reduced wear on the battlefield improves the reliability of our tracked vehicles."
  turret_vehicle_tech:0 "Improved Turrets"
  turret_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "While refitting our tracked chassis with an artillery piece brought never seen firepower back to the wasteland, using it in practice showed us how vulnerable it is. Improvising a turret around it from the remaining part of the construction vehicle we based our design on would not only improve the weapon's longevity but also would bring the additional cover to mounted firepower."
  aps_vehicle_tech:0 "Reinforced Armor Plates"
  aps_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Maybe it is not unequivocal to the untrained personnel, but armoured plates on armoured vehicles have their own science. Reinforcement not only means adding thicker and more trained metal atop the hull but their form or placement also improves the survivability of said tank. The well placed and well-formed piece can deter any projectile, if it arrives from the appropriate angle, that is. "
  mobile_weapons_vehicle_tech:0 "Mobile Assault Weaponry"
  mobile_weapons_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Automatic fire support is while very useful in most environments, they're necessarily cumbersome to carry, and as such, they're not fit for mobile warfare. Except, of course, if we would put the assault fireteam on a truck or a motorbike and would mount their weaponry to the top of the platform or in the sidecar. In those conditions, their fire support would tip the scales in our favour."

  extra_plating_vehicle_tech:0 "Protected Storage"
  extra_plating_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Providing welded metal baskets for our vehicles will let our crew store their gear more safely than if it was just thrown on it. More equipment into battle allows our mobile divisions and tracked vehicles to go much longer without needing refuelling and rearming, lessening the strain on our supply network."
  fuel_booster_vehicle_tech:0 "Engine Overclocking"
  fuel_booster_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Transforming the powerpacks of our armored vehicles into gas guzzlers might seem like a bad idea, but open valves, wider fuel pipeline, and scrapped protective casing for better cooling will give an impressive burst of speed to even the heaviest tank. Such changes will of course require a better fuel manufacturing network, but the tactical and strategical advantage cannot be ignored."
  extra_gunports_vehicle_tech:0 "Gun Ports"
  extra_gunports_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Cut-out gun ports in the passenger compartment of our APCs, as well as pistol ports for our tanks, will add every available firepower on board to the fight. Pistol ports allows our tank crew to defend themselves from infantry assault, while gun ports in our vehicles will let rifle fire slam into any soft target foolish enough to get near. The vehicle crew, however, has to slow down to allow accurate fire."
  solar_power_vehicle_tech:0 "Advanced Fuels"
  solar_power_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "Advanced chemical manufacturing, such as molecular filtering, result in fuels with higher octane rating and thus much more suited to tuned engines with better compression ratios. Less dirt and impurities will also increase the service duration of our fuel filters and combustion chambers, increasing the service life of our powerpacks."
  vaccum_sealing_vehicle_tech:0 "Vacuum Sealing"
  vaccum_sealing_vehicle_tech_desc:0 "When we first approached the idea of the reintroduction of vehicle combat, we really did not take the comfort of our passengers into the theory. While in pre-war vehicles vacuum sealing was a basic feature, which did not let in the hot of the summer or the cold of the nuclear winter into the vehicle, in our combat cars it is still a luxury. As soon we introduced our tapes to vacuum seal all of our vehicles, the sooner will our soldiers' performance will increase."

  #apc_tech_1:0 "Salvaged APC"
  #apc_tech_1_desc:0 "Salvaged heavy trucks clad in armor provides a much more suitable base to our mechanized divisions. Thicker armor plating supported by better suspensions and high-torque engines can now resist rifle fire, laser attacks and even anti-tank rifle projectiles. A forward-mounted heavy machine gun with provision to move it to other firing ports throughout the vehicle brings suitable firepower for frontline combat, and all these features combine finally allow our vehicle crew to directly support our infantry division, resulting in much better combined-arm defenses and assaults."
  #apc_tech_2:0 "Wasteland APC"
  #apc_tech_2_desc:0 "A tracked chassis to navigate the blasted wasteland much easier, together with a twin coupled engine drive and reinforced armor platings is the result of our engineers' effort into better AFVs for our mechanized divisions. A ramp system allowing disembarking under armor protection, an external communication system for infantry support and a new mixed machine gun belt with incendiary and armor-piercing projectiles continue to improve the cooperation potential between vehicles and infantry."
  #apc_tech_3:0 "Great War APC"
  #apc_tech_3_desc:0 "Pre-war APCs are the top of the line in matter of what we can manufacture currently. Composite armor plating with spall liners, as well as kevlar protection for crew and mounted infantry alike will save the lives of many foot soldier, while the short infantry support gun will blast apart any fortified position or enemy that our boys on the ground may encounter."
