  unbroken_resistance_pact_event.1.t:0 "A Stirring of the North"
  unbroken_resistance_pact_event.1.d:0 "After our recent victory over our enemies, our informants have discovered that this time, other nations seem to have noticed. Recently a gathering of most of the major factions in the north's leadership was called upon, and from what we have gathered the topic is mutual defensive actions, and yet for some reason we were not invited... The details of the deal will be hammered out in the next two weeks. For now, we wait."
  unbroken_resistance_pact_event.1.a:0 "This will do nothing to save them."

  unbroken_resistance_pact_event.2.t:0 "Sign the \"Unbroken Resistance\" Pact"
  unbroken_resistance_pact_event.2.d:0 "After the recent aggressive actions by the Broken Coast, it has been suggested that the nations of the north form a pact to discourage further expansion. Signatories of this 'Unbroken Resistance' Pact will be obligated to send each other volunteers in the event of aggression from the Broken Coast or any of their allies. Signatories will also be expected to open up additional trade opportunities with each other and join a strict embargo against the Broken Coast. Failure to follow through with these obligations would have potentially serious consequences."
  unbroken_resistance_pact_event.2.a:0 "Where do we sign up?"
  unbroken_resistance_pact_event.2.b:0 "We decline to sign."

  unbroken_resistance_pact_event.3.t:0 "The \"Unbroken Resistance\" Pact"
  unbroken_resistance_pact_event.3.d:0 "It appears that the previously discovered meetings have borne fruit. A new pact between nations of the north, dubbed the \"Unbroken Resistance\" pact, attempts to limit our expansion into neighbours. From what we can gather, this is not a formal alliance, but rather a loose defensive network. They can then quickly mobilize and attempt to reinforce our opponents with volunteers via the Columbia River. We can still utilize our naval prowess to invade those outside of the pact, however, keep in mind that these distant lands are not our ultimate goal and can only serve as colonies."
  unbroken_resistance_pact_event.3.a:0 "More brahmin to the slaughter."
