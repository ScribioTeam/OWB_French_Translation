  # Consolidation
  nf_event_ach.1.t:0 "An Old New Focus"
  nf_event_ach.1.d:0 "While our brothers to the north cling to their dreams of restoring the old world, we have seen the truth. Technology still needs to be safeguarded until humanity is ready for it again. Until then, will we stand eternal vigil. The choice was not easy, but we all agree that it was necessary. Let us never forget our brothers, even those that decided to leave the brotherhood for promises of restoring something that has failed time and time again."
  nf_event_ach.1.a:0 "To safeguard humanity"

  # Open the Vaults
  nf_event_ach.2.t:0 "Open the Vaults"
  nf_event_ach.2.d:0 "Even as part of the Texas branch we collected and safeguarded technology, though one of the reasons for our split was that they wanted to distribute what we guard. We can't let that happen obviously, but what of our now lonely vigil? We need every edge we can get."
  nf_event_ach.2.a:0 "No matter the cost..."

  # Richmond Demand
  nf_event_ach.3.t:0 "Richmond: We Need It"
  nf_event_ach.3.d:0 "Direct land access to the USSA headquaters is basically mandatory. Let us achieve this, by force or by finance. Let us hope that our former brothers still have some symapthy for our mission."
  nf_event_ach.3.a:0 "Purchase Richmond"

  # HRO access Send Demand
  nf_event_ach.4.t:0 "Broadcast From Central Houston"
  nf_event_ach.4.d:0 "A war is costly, but we do not need to fight if they just give us unlimited access to their facilities. But if we have to, we will take it by force. One way or another the USSA headquaters secrets will be ours."
  nf_event_ach.4.a:0 "Houston, do we have a problem?"

  # Contact West
  nf_event_ach.5.t:0 "Chains that Bind"
  nf_event_ach.5.d:0 "We failed, be it due to atmospheric issues, broken satellites or what other obstacles could be present. For our best efforts to send a signal to Lost Hills, we failed. We are... alone."
  nf_event_ach.5.a:0 "Silence has never been so cruel."

  # Houston secrets ending
  nf_event_ach.6.t:0 "Relics of the Past"
  nf_event_ach.6.d:0 "To safeguard the past is our duty, even if it is out of physical reach. Codes, equipment, satellites. Let us use them to discover, to prevent humanity from abusing technology once more. Only those worthy enough shall wield the sword."
  nf_event_ach.6.a:0 "Magnify!"


  # Back to Texas
  nf_event_ach.41.t:0 "Brothers United"
  nf_event_ach.41.d:0 "We have no other choice. We need to return, abandon what made us our ancestors Brotherhood. The way forward is not ours. It is theirs. The way forward lies in Texas. May we hope to one day return to our charge. One day, once the menace from the south has been dealt with."
  nf_event_ach.41.a:0 "Humility, perhaps, is a virtue."

  # Midwest
  nf_event_ach.42.t:0 "Unexpected Aid"
  nf_event_ach.42.d:0 "They came with faces like devils.\n\nNot from the west, but from the north-east. They decended from great airships, looking like salvation itself. The Midwest is here. Saviors in Horned and beige armour."
  nf_event_ach.42.a:0 "Does Barnaky still live?"

  # Houston Access HRO recieves
  nf_event_ach.100.t:0 "They Demand Access"
  nf_event_ach.100.d:0 "The Elder of the Alamo chapter has come forth and demanded access to our territory. We can either grant it to them or, in their words, suffer the consquences. Considering how they run about, frothing at the mouth at the mere prospect of seeing the internals of the space center? We should consider thorougly. Refusal means war."
  nf_event_ach.100.a:0 "Let them in"
  nf_event_ach.100.b:0 "Defy them"

  nf_event_ach.101.t:0 "Draft the results"
  nf_event_ach.101.d:0 "Meticulus research, cross referencing and correlating of dozens of data snippets has given us some insight. All of these military bases we have visited had direct access to something called Poseidonet. Some form of internal communications network spanning the entirety of the pre war US. Related to Poseidon Energy, a massive pre war conglomerate of dozens of different companies, primairly in the energy sector. Even better, we believe that with all the pieces we have found, we might be able to gain access to this still, partially operational, network."
  nf_event_ach.101.a:0 "Let us proced with caution."

  nf_event_ach.102.t:0 "Poseidon IFF"
  nf_event_ach.102.d:0 "The Enclave, a foe that brought us almost to extinction before the NCR wiped them out back west. We hid, as best as we could to avoid their wrath. Unhinged, without morals, and seeing themselves the successor to the pre war United States of America Government. It seems that Poseidon energy was deeply intertwined with this pre war shadow government consisting of industrialists, high ranking officials and even some presidents. Purely a contingency to continue government they said in the case of catastrophe, but our records tell a different story. They tried to use a Virus to eradicate everyone on the continent, to repopulate it with whom ever they managed to store away in secret bunkers. A genocide, one that would have reduced humanities gene pool so drastically, we might as well have surrendered and become inbred. \n\nRegardless of that though, the Enclave used Poseidonet extensively, from automated security, communications and many other secret things. We could even trick their defenses to believe we are them with what our scribes and knights have created. A fully functional IFF module, with it, we are, Enclave. At least to those who don't ask too many questions."
  nf_event_ach.102.a:0 "We are Enclave, if it suits us."

  nf_event_ach.103.t:0 "I don't want to set the world on fire"
  nf_event_ach.103.d:0 "This is absurd, so many nukes in one place. The great Silo, a depot that Tlaloc has full access to, over the subnetwork called Chiconet. Another piece of the puzzle really, Chiconet, being a subsection of Poseidonet itself. Regardless, we did not just secure the warheads, to safeguard them, but we also got some Launch codes. It seems even in death, the god of rain, did not manage to use all of them. How many did the pre war world build? How many weapons of ultimate destruction?"
  nf_event_ach.103.a:0 "Let us never use them."

  nf_event_ach.104.t:0 "Make it Rain"
  nf_event_ach.104.d:0 "Tlaloc, the super AI implemented by Poseidon energy to help with the occupation of Mexico. It used thousands of robots, to control it all, to make every human it's slave. At least until it died and freed all of it's victims from the joke of the machine. Still, as vile as the machine was in life, as useful can it be for us in death. Advanced robots, intricate circuitry, let us use this to our advantage to further what we know."
  nf_event_ach.104.a:0 ""

  nf_event_ach.105.t:0 "It called back"
  nf_event_ach.105.d:0 "Out there in those hostile waters, standing like a bulwark against the backdrop of the endless ocean, a rather dinky and derelict oil rig, most likely long having exhausted all of it's resources. Yet it seems to be still alive, and after we pinged it we know the truth. Our hails were soon answered, we found a bunch of pre war zombies, housed within the place. They told us their entire story without us even asking, then offered to come over for a talk. They had met other survivors before, but they seemed far less polite than we did, calling themselves the enclave those survivors did. Fighting erupted and the survivors were no more, but their technology remained. Advanced flying Vertical takeoff vehicles. Alongside schematics for them. We will be ready once those "ghouls" want to set foot on Texan soil."
  nf_event_ach.105.a:0 "Let's take the birds, and leave the ghouls."
