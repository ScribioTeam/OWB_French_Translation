  wpg_transcona_bridge: "The Transcona Bridge"
  wpg_transcona_bridge_desc:0 "Sunken in the waters are remnants of rusted arches and criss-crossed metal beams.  What once was a grand railway bridge glares at us from the shore; both a memory and opportunity.  Salvaging and rebuilding this bridge could mean a grand expansion of our industry."

  wpg_free_navy: "The Free Navy"

  wpg_roach_king_reclamation: "Stepping On The Roach"
  wpg_roach_king_reclamation_desc:0 "Whispered tales tell of a vile, incomprehensible man from the south.  They say the roaches and irradiated plants heed his every command.  We’re not sure how that is, but one thing’s certain— the roach must be squashed."

  wpg_defenders_republic: "Defenders Of The Republic"
  wpg_defenders_republic_desc:0 "We must continue spreading the call to action–-of a future where men live without kings—and rile up the spirits of our defenders and those who would be.  With their hearts they rally.  With their spirits they concur!  "
  wpg_heart_of_steele: "Heart of Steele"
  wpg_heart_of_steele_desc:0 "“Even as a young commander, I had seen the cost of war.  Of bureaucrats and rebels—of men and their strife.  Never in my career had I imagined a single call to have granted me the presidency of the Republic.  But it happened, and here I stand uncontested.  To the people, know you are in good hands.  To the unruly?  Leave while you can.”  —Eloi Steele"

  wpg_power_armor_desc:0 "We’ve made interesting contacts from beyond the shore.  A group of armourers have presented us a line of mechanised armour beyond what we’ve ever seen.  They’ve given us options and long-numbered prices.  Shall we begin negotiations?"

  wpg_canadian_models_desc:0 "We’ve put in a request for our own make of power armour to the armourers, and just our luck, they’ve accepted!  While it isn’t anything they’ve worked with before, they’ve offered us the means to blueprint and build the schematics."

  wpg_buyout_prospectors_desc:0 "While the resources given by the Republic have been quaint, MacGregor wants to broaden his horizons.  Production in the North End has been slow as of late.  Perhaps some special arrangements should be made for more tasteful results?"

  wpg_improve_our_doctrine_desc:0 "Outdated doctrines are the downfalls of society... or so they say.  Though, we shouldn’t give that notion a chance to be proven right.  Let’s tidy up our doctrines and make room for aerial accommodations.  It’s been all the buzz lately!"
  wpg_new_concepts_airship: "Apply New Concepts"

  wpg_in_lockstep_desc:0 "“I remember reading about lock-step in an old warbook.  These tight knitted formations held fronts when I had to call quick shots.  It’s easy, and it’s just dawn upon me that it isn’t a part of standardised training...  Rally up the soldiers!  We’ve got something to learn!” —Eloi Steele"
  wpg_separation_church_state: "The Separation Of Church And State"
  wpg_separation_church_state_desc:0 "OId believers be damned, if we are meant to push onward, we must free ourselves from false notions and focus our sights on reality.

  wpg_fort_construction_boost: "Take Inspiration From The Fort"

  wpg_pardon_monarchist_scientists_desc:0 "While we’ve expunged the monarchists from our Republic, it is a shame that we’ve lost some great minds in the process.  Perhaps we can spare a pardon to those looking to repent and devote their all."

  ## Events

  nf_trr.1.t:0 "Stand on Guard For One's Liberties"
  nf_trr.1.d: "Know this - Three Rivers never fell by conquest.  We accepted a king as a liberator, but he was a spontaneous choice of the people. Whatever Manitoba says, we were always as good as our king. To us, the relationship was one of equals and friends. He provided military support, and we provided economic support. Subjects? No. We are citizens, and obeyed him only due to our contractual obligations.  Our relationship worked, for a while. The king honoured our rights, and we served the people. Our airships ferried supplies to outposts and garrisons, and equipped the Mounties with the finest weapons this side of the Great Lakes. But when the Good King died, and a ghoul lover crawled his way onto the throne, things had to change."
  nf_trr.1.a:0 "They worked a lot better than roads."
  nf_trr.1.b:0 "But we contributed soldiers too."


  nf_trr.2.t:0 "The Right To Be Wrong"
  nf_trr.2.d: "Why did the Republic rise up? Ask a thousand different people and get a thousand different answers. For some, it started when the King passed war taxes and conscripted our youth to crush the Metis. What quarrel was that of ours? Why would we fight a far away people who bother us not? For others, it was the King's attempt to nationalize our airship industry.  He didn't build that, after all. And for some? Well, the King's preference getting a bit long in the tooth. Can you really trust a leader who will go feral any day?"
  nf_trr.2.a:0 "If he wasn't going feral, he would have given in to our demands."
  nf_trr.2.b:0 "No king can take our hard earned wealth by force."

  nf_trr.3.t:0 "Too Many Cooks"
  nf_trr.3.d: "Sadly, the Republic failed to finish off the Kingdom. Even now, [BRA.GetLeader] plots in a warren of despotism to retake our homeland.  To the west, the Admiral  fights the good fight, but we face threats within. Seven years ago, a cabal of monarchists and socialists plotted to overthrow the Republic with a call of universal suffrage under Good King [BRA.GetLeader]. Eloi Steele, hero of the Revolution, crushed the plotters with a whiff of grapeshot; but only now has she become First Minister for Three Rivers. What fate awaits us? \n\nWill she succumb to base populism, and give every person a say? Will she seize a crown for herself? And if she tries, can the Senate and People stop her?"
  nf_trr.3.a:0 "The Senate stands ready to guard its liberties."
  nf_trr.3.b:0 "The people stand with their favourite."


  nf_trr.4.t:0 "A Raid of Legend"
  nf_trr.4.d: "[WPG.GetLeader] invited us to join their upcoming war with the Kingdom of Manitoba. should we do so? There will be rich hunting in those lands... but it might be disastrous for us."

  nf_trr.4.a_tt:0 "\n§gYou will join the war. Hurray!§!"

  nf_trr.5.a:0 "It really is."

  nf_trr.6.t:0 "The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything."
  nf_trr.6.d: "[PAP.GetName] refused to join our war. What a waste. For us, I mean."
  nf_trr.6.a:0 "It really is."


  nf_trr.7.t:0 "Capturing the Great White Beast"
  nf_trr.7.d: "They tell rumours, up north, of the Aurora. The airship forever prepared, and forever unready. A pre-war American airship designed to support the occupation, it coasted on autopilot for centuries after the bombs fell. The crew starved to death shortly after the war, but nobody told the machine where to land; so it did not. The rumours speak of a glittering treasure in the sky, secrets and riches from beyond the war. But no one could reach that vessel, always just out of reach. Until the Captain. \n\nNow we've made contact, and the Baron is the first aboard.  Everyone who doubted him for so long will see they've made a terrible mistake- and what better place to make his new home? "
  nf_trr.7.a:0 "What a lovely view."

  nf_trr.8.t:0 "The Second Coalition"
  nf_trr.8.d:0 "[WPG.GetLeader] wishes to end the conflict between the Kingdom and its rebels once and for all.  Accordingly, they've called the peoples of Manitoba together to discuss a coalition to take down the king - a 'popular front' in the spirit of the original Canadian People's Front. Who shall prevail?"
  nf_trr.8.a:0 "We will fight and be right!"
  nf_trr.8.b:0 "Let this be our final battle!"
  nf_trr.8.c:0 "Silly Canadarians."
  nf_trr.8.e:0 "Bourgoise fools, all of them."

  nf_trr.9.t:0 "When Treason Prospers, None Dare Call It Treason"
  nf_trr.9.d:0 "The King is dead - long live the people.  \n\nAfter much strife, we've freed Manitoba from the monarchists' clutches. No longer will anyone pretend to be the king of Canada - only a free people, with a government of laws, and not of men. But that's the problem, isn't it? We've captured the queen of Manitoba, and must decide her fate. Some call for execution for her complicity in the war. Others say we should merely hang her like any other criminal.  Finally, some say we should let her survive as a commoner, punishing her to survive in a land that recognizes no nobility.  What shall we do? One could argue that she was never a subject of ours and so committed no crimes. But that would be unpopular at home."
  nf_trr.9.a:0 "Give her the public execution we couldn't the king."
  nf_trr.9.b:0 "Hang her like a common criminal."
  nf_trr.9.c:0 "The court finds her innocent!"

  nf_trr.10.t:0 "A Toast to the Heroes!"
  nf_trr.10.d:0 "While we made peace with the monarchy, not everyone was so, ah, weak willed. The revolutionary Mouseketeers kept fighting, under the Admiral. And under the Admiral they prevailed. Already the Admiral is cleaning Brandon's streets of any monarchist filth to ensure the Revolution's victory."
  nf_trr.10.a:0 "Hurray?"
