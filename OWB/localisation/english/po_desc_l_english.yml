ces_puppet_leader_desc:0 "Not every tribe is worthy of standing as an equal under the Bull, that honour must be earnt. The Administratio Imperii is tasked with creating a new society out of the old, with dismantling technology, enslaving women and children, and conscripting every able bodied man into the legion being only the start of their noble task."

des_puppet_leader_desc:0 "It takes time to bring peace to a land that's never known it, and sometimes, it takes tough love too. Ranger Command has undertaken the task of creating law and order in its new territories, and it plans on getting the job done right."
