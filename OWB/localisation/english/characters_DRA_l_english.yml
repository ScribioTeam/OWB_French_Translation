  dra_abolish_want_desc:0 "The people of the Dramatae require little beyond what will help them survive and fulfill their roles, resisting the urge to hoard supplies or demand additional creature comforts. Their homes are also designed to suit whatever their character motif happens to be, whether it’s a merchant’s shop or a scientist's laboratory. When you trust in fate's design and are ready to play your part within its scheme, what need is there for greater luxuries and excess beyond what you can make use of?"
