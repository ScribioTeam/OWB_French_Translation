  PIPBOY_PLUS_CREDITS_TEXT_CREDITS:0 "Old World Blues would not be possible without the host of wonderful developers we have working on the team currently. Each of them brings unique skills and thought processes to the mod, without which we would never be able to achieve the quality we constantly strive for. The OWB team, everybody: \n\n§Y4l3x4nd3r, AASGucciG, Anthony Trollope, Aquila, CGS, evil_c0okie, Faeelin, Freddy, Garnithor, HappyNTH, Herckeim, HK33, ICodeMaster, Indyclone77, jackyboygood, JSolars, Karlov, KD, Krako, LightningEagle, LimonenZitrone, Lord Militus, LusaLy, Mason The Goblin King, McGebe, Meldanen, Michael, Mikael Kerularius, MrBlazzar, NuclearForest, octaman, SayruZ, shoggi, Shudderfly, skip, Soviet_Cyber, StealthArcher, Tar, Teddy, The_Colonel, The Human Called Daniel, wtchappell, Thyrork, tran, Twit, violet, Wicked_Rhyme, Xeno, Yard1, and Zusk.§! \n\nWe're also incredibly grateful to all the developers who have been with us in the past, but have left the team along the way, with an especially huge debt of gratitude owed to OWB's founding fathers: \n§YAntoniusMaximus (Ant Clarke), ClesiuZ, chacolah, Chismar, Loonybinjin, Mechano, and Zapdude.§! \n\nWe'd also like to thank our testers for their hard work and dedication to getting this mod playable and enjoyable for you, the fans. Without their advice and guidance we'd have burnt out long ago, and launch would be even more of a buggy mess than it was. \n\nThe HOI4 modding community has also been incredibly helpful in the creation, and continuation, of Old World Blues. Without the friendly and helpful attitudes of many members of the community we'd have struggled to overcome certain problems, and this spitit of cooperation we stive to always follow ourselves. A special thanks goes to §RDayshine§! for the wonder that is CWTools. \n\nThe following artists have work that has been used in the mod.
