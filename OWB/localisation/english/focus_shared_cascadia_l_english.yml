  cascadia_industry1:0 "Picking It Back Up"
  cascadia_industry1_desc:0 "The Whiteout is a cruel place, often unforgiving and brutal in its dealings. We must prepare for the next winter, lest it be as harsh as the last."
  cascadia_scavengingteams:0 "Scavenging Teams"
  cascadia_scavengingteams_desc:0 "We will send scavenging teams out into the wastes to retrieve whatever scrap they can find for our foundries."
  cascadia_shovellingsnow:0 "Shovelling Snow"
  cascadia_shovellingsnow_desc:0 "Without proper infrastructure allotted throughout the land, massive snowdrifts from the north pile up outside our walls, distorting the land and drowning out life. We will wage a war against the frost itself."
  cascadia_rebuildingprogram:0 "Rebuilding the Roads"
  cascadia_rebuildingprogram_desc:0 "Many of the roads in Cascadia are destroyed or left in such an eroded state that they're unusable by our caravans and vehicles. Even if it's just with gravel and leftover dirt mash, flattening them out will serve us tremendously well."
  cascadia_programestablished:0 "Laying Foundations"
  cascadia_programestablished_desc:0 "With the roads back in action, we can afford to lean more into outside dealings and internal affairs!"
  cascadia_armaments:0 "New Armaments"
  cascadia_armaments_desc:0 "The world is not a nice place. We will take measures to strengthen our own armaments initiatives, restoring and rebuilding new factories around the nation."
  cascadia_goodoldusa:0 "Good Old American Iron"
  cascadia_goodoldusa_desc:0 "Many of the United States National Guard checkpoints still litter Cascadia on either side of the Canadian-American border. Why don't we salvage what we can?"
  cascadia_disassembling:0 "Grease, Degrease, Repeat"
  cascadia_disassembling_desc:0 "Many of the weapons we've found littering the Cascadian Whiteout are broken, unusable, and all other associated terms. Let's tear 'em apart and see what makes them tick, and make some stuff that doesn't break or explode when we try to put a round in it!"
  cascadia_encouragingmilitias:0 "Encouraging Militias"
  cascadia_encouragingmilitias_desc:0 "Many of our locals are... Eager, to say the least. Encouraging local militias and militants to supply their own with weaponry and create their own munitions will increase our strength considerably."
  cascadia_research:0 "Dedicated Research Teams"
  cascadia_research_desc:0 "The world may have been ended by scientists, but we'll do the opposite of that. If we want to, that is. Don't think too much about it."
  cascadia_power:0 "Crossing The Right Wires"
  cascadia_power_desc:0 "If we want to actually build anything useful, we'll need to actually manage to get something to turn out without combusting in multiple hilariously violent ways. Let's try a bunch of random shit until it works, and hope for the best!"
  cascadia_rememberyourcoat:0 "Remember Your Coat On Your Way Out"
  cascadia_rememberyourcoat_desc:0 "The Whiteout is a cold place. Keeping a coat on hand is mandatory, and really, just common sense. So, in short, let's just keep some minor tips on hand for the folks who don't really like to use their thinking brain so that way they can, well, y'know, think better."
  cascadia_warming:0 "Warming The People"
  cascadia_warming_desc:0 "We've reached a point we can start to use actual heaters we've refurbished instead of lighting a barrel on fire and breathing in hot garbage. Truly, we are becoming more civilized than we could have ever hoped for!"
  cascadia_turningthelightson:0 "Turning the Lights On"
  cascadia_turningthelightson_desc:0 "How did it go? "Last one out, hit the lights?" Well, that doesn't make much sense with the context, but it sounds cool, so we're saying it."
  cascadia_sweatshops:0 "Sweatshops"
  cascadia_sweatshops_desc:0 "Some of the workmen have taken to calling our freshly-heated buildings "Sweatshops" since we're still learning how to tune the damn things. Cute, isn't it? Even if the implications are, uh, not."
  cascadia_industryend:0 "Cascadian Boom"
  cascadia_industryend_desc:0 "We've cleared the snow, restored heat, and scavenged enough to make us the envy of every little gang and town in the wastes. Cascadia may be a tough place to be, but whether anyone likes it or not, we're here to stay."

  cascadia_againstthewhiteout:0 "Against the Whiteout"
  cascadia_againstthewhiteout_desc:0 "The Whiteout may feel like a desolation of horrible proportions, but we're not alone in it. If we're to survive the next blizzard, we're gonna need to be ready in case anyone tries to upstage us."
  cascadia_winterized:0 "Winterizing the Men"
  cascadia_winterized_desc:0 "The last blizzard wrecked many of the standing militaries and groups here in the north. We can't let that happen a second time. We'll winterize all of our men to the best of our ability."
  cascadia_attrition:0 "Blizzard FOBs"
  cascadia_attrition_desc:0 "Out there in the snow, there's several facilities that could be refurbished into proper, functioning outposts. Let's send out teams and help our men know which ones to stake out in."
  cascadia_permanentresidency:0 "Permanent Residency"
  cascadia_permanentresidency_desc:0 "Many of the outposts we found are working great, but the men need better conditions to survive. We'll equip them and grant them more resources for the field so that they can stand their ground better."
  cascadia_strengthinnumbers:0 "Strength in Numbers"
  cascadia_strengthinnumbers_desc:0 "Everyone knows more is better. We'll stack our men together, like a line in the snow, and strike fear into our enemy's hearts from sheer solidarity."
  cascadia_cascadianmilitia:0 "Cascadian Military"
  cascadia_cascadianmilitia_desc:0 "If we're to be ready for whatever comes, we'll need the people to be ready first. Encouraging folks to train amongst our men and to teach one another will help enforce a proper standing militia."
  cascadia_qualityarms:0 "Quality Arms"
  cascadia_qualityarms_desc:0 "We should prioritize a thoughtful approach to our military. A bunch of guns that only kind of function helps no one."
  cascadia_quantityarms:0 "Quantity Arms"
  cascadia_quantityarms_desc:0 "We don't have the time or the resources to deal with waiting for quality. A massive influx of weaponry is far better than just a few guns that "shoot alright.""
  cascadia_thinkaboutit:0 "Teaching New Tactics"
  cascadia_thinkaboutit_desc:0 "We're sharing and spreading a lot of basic military knowledge, but it only means so much if the folks calling the shots are still inexperienced. We need to filter the next generation of commanding staff properly."
  cascadia_menatarms:0 "Hiring Men-at-Arms"
  cascadia_menatarms_desc:0 "The Men-At-Arms are a fairly scant organization, but strong enough to be of note. Though local to New Victoria, they consist of various defectors from the squabbling Brotherhoods in Seattle. Their loyalties may be dubious, but they're highly trained and capable men."
  cascadia_naval1:0 "The Frozen Waters"
  cascadia_naval1_desc:0 "Though it may not be an immediatelly accessible thought, preparing for a navy in our future expansion may be helpful. Though we may need to set up some factories to help establish our focuses on land before turning our eyes elsewhere."
  cascadia_navalbase:0 "Taking Trips Down The River"
  cascadia_navalbase_desc:0 "Experience, in any field, is key. Many of our folks have never even seen the ocean from its waters, only from the land. Taking little trips, testing people's sea legs-- that's the sort of things that'll ensure we're a successful nation and not a bad one."
  cascadia_navaldevelopment:0 "Investigating Shipwrecks"
  cascadia_navaldevelopment_desc:0 "There's plenty of shipwrecks and other oddities like inland fishing shacks that we can scavenge resources from. Gathering what we can from anything remotely resembling marine scraps'll help us secure a future navy."
  cascadia_workingaship:0 "Working the Ships"
  cascadia_workingaship_desc:0 "Some of the old ships out there may appear to be functional, but really it'd be better to just tear out a bunch and make sure we know what we're making ourselves. Wouldn't want to get on some pretty ship and then have it sink, would we?"
  cascadia_oldengines:0 "Retrofitting Old Engines"
  cascadia_oldengines_desc:0 "Old engines in old boats along the Cascadian coasts can be useful for a number of things. Tearing them apart'll help a helluva lot more than just the navy, that's for sure."
  cascadia_rivallingthecoast:0 "Rivalling the Coast"
  cascadia_rivallingthecoast_desc:0 "The Broken Coast pirates'll challenge us on either land or sea. Wherever we meet them, we'll be ready."
