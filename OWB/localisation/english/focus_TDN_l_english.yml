  den_story1:0 "A Den Of Wickedness"
  den_story1_desc:0 "Before the war the Den was just one of many small towns on the border between sunny California and foggy Oregon, a place almost forgotten by all gods. This peculiar position is what saved it from being hit by Chinese nuclear bombs."
  den_story2:0 "The Origin Of The Mordino Family"
  den_story2_desc:0 "The Den has had a large number of owners, but they are not so important. Everyone knows the Mordinos are the Den's real masters. Once, the whole of Nevada feared them, but like every great thing, they started small."
  den_story3:0 "The Mordino Expansion"
  den_story3_desc:0 "Once, the Mordinos were a mighty family who vied for domination of Reno. Oh, those glorious days... They're now long gone, but none of the Mordinos will deny himself the pleasure of nostalgia for those times."
  den_story4:0 "Too Big for The Biggest Little Town"
  den_story4_desc:0 "As rapid as the rise was the fall of the Mordino family's influence, was its fall. But what kicked them out? Depends on who you ask."

  den_slave_warriors_desc:0 "Don Mordino has long cherished the dream of restoring the true power of the Mordino family and re-establishing their power in New Reno. For this he needs fighters, many fighters. Slaves who believe in the promise of freedom make great recruits."
  den_hire_salvatore:0 "Hire Salvatores"
  den_hire_salvatore_desc:0 "Mordino has always had a rather complicated relationship with the Salvatores. We were never friends, but sometimes we worked together. Now that the family has lost its influence in Reno, it's time to recruit them and convince them to join our attack on the city."
  den_hire_van_graffs:0 "Hire Van Graffs"
  den_hire_van_graffs_desc:0 "It's no secret to us that the Reno families want to come to terms with the Van Graffs. They are currently one of the few independent forces in Northern California. But why not make them a counter offer and lure them over to our side?"
  den_anti_reno_coalition_yakuza:0 "Hire Yakuza Ronin"
  den_anti_reno_coalition_yakuza_desc:0 " The Yakuza are a proud people that have their own issues with Reno. They generally keep to themselves - but everyone has a price."

  den_border_war_desc:0 "We managed to muster a large force. We have our own soldiers, Salvatores and Van Graffs. We have our allies - Yakuza and Jackals. But before starting an attack, we need to demonstrate our own strength, and seize a launching point to take dwown Reno. The Sierra Army Depot will do for a start."
  den_conquest_reno:0 "Return to Reno"

  den_slaver_raid_forways:0 "Raid on Fourways"
  den_slaver_raid_forways_desc:0 "For further development we need initial capital, but the Den has a disgusting reputation and no one will invest in the wretched city. We need cheap labor and slaves to sell, luckily we can easily get them."
  den_slaver_raid_medford:0 "Raid on Medford"
  den_slaver_raid_medford_desc:0 "Medford is one of many small communities in Northern California. We need its inhabitants as cheap labor that we can use on our construction sites."

  den_new_dawn_of_slavery_desc:0 "The damned rangers harassed the Den's slavers for years, but with their distraction in the Mojave we can find new 'servants' for the Wasteland. As long as we bribe the Republic to look the other way..."
  den_rebecca_casino:0 "Rebecca's Casino"

  den_expansion_van_graffs:0 "Van Graff Expansion"

  den_megaladon_club_desc: "Shark Club was rightfully considered one of the largest gambling establishments in the city, attracting everyone who wished to try their luck.

  den_gladiators: "Gladiator Fights"
  den_gladiators_desc: "The Bishops promoted certain rules, such as banning blades or fights to the death.  But that was a bit boring.  Inspired by the Legion, let's make people fight to the death for sport! What fun."

  den_tipography: "Restore Printing"
  den_tipography_desc: "Of course, Cat's Paw was not just a brothel, once there was a printing house that published the famous erotic magazine. Sadly, only a few copies are left after two centuries. But we can print more!"

  den_addictsworks_desc:0 "There are some who say the Mordinos control through Jet. That's slander.  We merely offer discounts on jet to those who need it most as long as they sign several years away working for us."
  den_goldenglobes: "Golden Globes"
  den_goldenglobes_desc: " The Corsican brothers created the first porn studio since the bombs fell, and they continue to provide morale support to the fighting men and women of the NCR. We don't just make money - we make a better world."
  den_chopshop: "Chop Shop"
  den_chopshop_desc: "The Chop Shop originally appeared as a tiny workshop on the City's outskirts.  But now it's one of the best automobile dealerships in the Wasteland! Just make sure nobody keys your car.  Just kidding. \n\nThis joke constitutes full warning and absolves the Chop Shop of all liability."
  den_powerplant: "City Power Plant"
  den_powerplant_desc: "The Wrights have long been a part of the city's power structure, and, in fact, built our lovely power plant! Some say it's fueled by their self-satisfaction, but we know it's environmentally friendly coal."
  den_distillery: "The Restored Distillery"

  den_newpeople: "New Citizens"
  den_newpeople_desc: "One thing could never be taken away from Wrights - idealism. They always believed that if you build it, they will come.  (It in this case being a social infrastructure and not a baseball park). Realizing at least part of their plans is a good opportunity for us to attract new residents to the city."
  den_contracts:0 "Extended Contracts"
  den_contracts_desc:0 "Unlike the tyrannical New California Republic, we don't force our citizens to fight. Instead, our citizens coordinate with leading families to defend us all! Aren't they heroes?"
  den_golgotha:0 "Golgotha's  Restoration"
  den_golgotha_desc:0 "Golgotha is the graveyard outside of Reno, where the dead were buried and the enemies of certain families were sent to be disposed of. Restoring Golgotha to its original purpose would remove the enemies of mobster families much more discreetly."
  den_salvatorebar: "Salvatore's Italian Grill"
  den_salvatorebar_desc: "Salvatore's isn't just a bar - it has some of the best Italian food in the Wasteland. How do we know? It's the only Italian place, as far as we know!"
  den_chem: "Renesco's Pharmacy"
  den_chem_desc: "Renesco's pharmacy is for Salvatore one of oldest and most profitable investments that they ever had. This is not just a place for selling chemicals, it is the main drug trafficking hub in the city. It is here that all the pushers in the city are bought with chemicals. Our family makes a lot of money from this, and this trade needs to be expanded."
  den_arms: "New Reno Arms"
  den_arms_desc: " New Reno Arms is one of the most elite arms suppliers in all of northern California. They say that many of their handmade samples are even superior in quality to those that Gun Runners produce from Boneyard. And investing in expanding their business is beneficial, including the opportunity to better arm our people."
  den_sanctuary:0 "Sanctuary City"
  den_sanctuary_desc:0 "Reno is a prosperous city, and we often find the disenfranchised of the Wasteland at our gates. By agreeing to turn a blind eye to past misconduct, we may gain an influx of new citizens."
  den_sweatshop:0 "Sweatshop Labour"
  den_sweatshop_desc:0 "The ends justify the means, and sweatshop labour is ultimately extremely efficient. These are wasters and junkies who would die on the streets, at least this way they are employed."
  den_sierradepot:0 "Looting the Sierra Depot"
  den_sierradepot_desc:0 "The Sierra Army Depot holds armaments and treasures unimaginable. Having a designated team looting the Depot would create a steady import of armaments to the mobster families of Reno.  But why is everyone in Vault City so angry about this?"
  den_techslot:0 "Sierra Depot Excavation"
  den_techslot_desc:0 "Converting the Sierra Depot looting to a full scale excavation would take some manpower, but ultimately the pre-War secrets of the army base are too valuable to ignore. We could glean much insight from the Depot."
########## Den military branch
  den_mercmilitary:0 "Merc Military"
  den_mercmilitary_desc:0 "Reno has no standing fighting force, unless you consider the mobsters of the individual families. Instead, they must rely on mercenaries as their armies. The vast wealth of Reno means their merc's contracts last very long, however."
  den_radio:0 "New Reno Radio"
  den_radio_desc:0 "Construction radio towers across Reno would be useful both for entertainment, as we can broadcast music, but also as a way of subterfuge and communicating without mobsters and other armies."
  den_oldbirds:0 "The Old Birds"
  den_oldbirds_desc:0 "The Old Birds are a mercenary group of pre-war Ghouls who were trained as paratroopers and pilots. With the recently opened airport in Reno, we can hire these mercs as a potential air force."
  den_precautions:0 "Precautions"
  den_precautions_desc:0 "Precautions must be taken in Reno to protect our assets. It is not enough to rely on the peace of our neighbours in such a place as the Wasteland. A great wall must be constructed around New Reno."
  den_hedge:0 "Hedged Bets"
  den_hedge_desc:0 "Fortifying the ex-Yakuza territory should be a good enough disincentive for any more raider groups to take refuge in the area. Also, with potential enemies growing in the South and West, it is never bad to hedge your bets."
  den_airport:0 "Old Reno Airport"
  den_airport_desc:0 "A restoration effort could be made on the airport of pre-War Reno, allowing it to be reused as an airbase just out of Reno. The possibilities of a network of Reno planes is endless."
  den_capsforloyalty:0 "Caps For Loyalty"
  den_capsforloyalty_desc:0 "Though many say mercenaries' allegiances are fragile at best, caps are the greatest motivator for many living in the Wasteland, and we have lots of it."
  den_tactics: "Mercenary Tacticians"
  den_tactics_desc: "We, as a city-state, simply do not have an impressive officer system, we have to rely on hired captains to lead our troops. And it would be nice to generalize their experience to improve troop leadership."
  den_councilfunding:0 "Military Council Funding"
  den_councilfunding_desc:0 "In an almost unprecedented act, we could formalize a council of mobsters devoted entirely to arranging military actions, among the mobster bodyguards and mercenary armies we have on contract."
  den_enctech:0 "Van Graff Advisors"
  den_enctech_desc:0 "Say what you will about Mama Van Gruff, but when it comes to war, she knows her stuff. Why don't we give her a seat on the council?"
  den_mutanttech:0 "Mutant Technicians"
  den_mutanttech_desc:0 "And to this military council, we could add a super mutant who was once a general in the Master's Army, who's great experience in Wasteland warfare would revolutionize our council."
  den_merc: "More Mercenary Companies"
  den_merc_desc: "In the vicinity of New Reno there are many mercenary companies of very different sizes, each of which is looking for its own employer. Acting carefully enough, we could make good use of them to our own benefit."
  den_vengefulsons:0 "The Vengeful Sons"
  den_vengefulsons_desc:0 "The Vengeful Sons are vicious tribals driven from their land by the brutal dictator Caesar. While largely disorganized, their ferocity in battle and great numbers, not to mention their burning vengeance, would make them a great asset."
  den_pablos:0 "Pablo's Conquistadors"
  den_pablos_desc:0 "Pablo's Conquistadors are a veteran unit of highly disciplined infantry out of the southern land of Mexico. They are very adaptable and well trained, and can be utilized in almost any situation."
  den_blackvultures: "Buy Black Hawk Banditos"
  den_blackvultures_desc: "Black Hawks, according to their stories, came from far south, even outside of Mexico, where everything is covered with radioactive predatory jungle. They are capable fighters that somehow maintain laser weapons is working, and fanatics who follow prophet of Santa Muerte."
  den_junkgladiators:0 "Junk City Gladiators"
  den_junkgladiators_desc:0 "The Junk City Gladiators are a mercenary army made up entirely of robots, led by an 'erratic', to say the least, captain named Pit Master Frazz. They would be very useful as heavy support."

  den_nanjimiclan_desc: "The Osana Shouko clan is a renegade among Yakuza, who dedicated their lives to revenge of NCR for a raid on Marklee in 2250. They are extremely dangerous and capable fighters, real sword masters. However, even they need money, and therefore they are forced to look for opportunities to earn from us."
  den_artillery:0 "The Hell-Hammers"
  den_artillery_desc:0 "The Hell-Hammers are a crazy, but rigidly organized band of men obsessed with armaments. Extremely skilled in artillery and heavy weaponry, they are quite possibly the greatest line of defense any city could ask for."
########## Den expansion branch
  den_expansionism:0 "Expansionism"
  den_expansionism_desc:0 "Sure, Reno's the biggest little city in the world, but why confine ourselves to a little city? We're a big power in the wastes, and it's time that was recognized. Why not expand our borders a little?"
  den_conquest_west:0 "Western Reaches"
  den_conquest_west_desc:0 "West of Den is the loosely controlled area of northern California. Soon, someone will enslave them. NCR, Arroyo or someone else. To ensure our own safety, we must get ahead of them."
  den_medford_slavery:0 "Prisoners Again"
  den_medford_slavery_desc:0 "Medford used to be a maximum security prison, which employed most of the city's population. While most of the townspeople died, the prisoners managed to take over the prison and survive the nuclear winter within its walls."
  den_medford_plantation:0 "Redemption Through Labor"
  den_medford_plantation_desc:0 "The current inhabitants of Medford bear the mark of the crimes of their ancestors. So let them work to atone for the sins of their ancestors. Of course, such words from us are terrible hypocrisy, but does someone care about it?"
  den_fourways_slavery:0 "More Tribal Slaves"
  den_fourways_slavery_desc:0 "What is the Fourways and what is the history of this place? To be honest, we don't know. But is the past of ordinary slaves important to us? Not at all. They should just work."
  den_fourways_plantation:0 "Sow Hunting Grounds"
  den_fourways_plantation_desc:0 "Previously, the tribe that lived in the Fourways lived on hunting alone. This is a terribly irrational use of the land. Of course, their surviving elders talk about breaking traditions, but we'll just plow their hunting grounds and sow corn."
  den_core_medford_fourways:0 "Anchored In The West"
  den_core_medford_fourways_desc:0 "Now the West is finally under our control. We firmly established ourselves there, destroying the traditional way of life of local tribes. But now these lands are embedded in the economic system of California, becoming an undiscovered part of it."
  den_klamathagreements:0 "The Gecko Trade"
  den_klamathagreements_desc:0 "Klamath still prospers from hunting geckos, and there's no reason we can't work with them. Them's good eating, especially at the Desperado Taco Bar!"
  den_debtwarriors:0 "Debt Warriors"
  den_debtwarriors_desc:0 "The warriors of Klamath are indebted to us for all New Reno provides, and now fight for Reno. Some may question our strict contracts, but Human Resources signed off on them, after all..."
  den_klamath_resourses:0 "Consume Klamath Goods"
  den_klamath_resourses_desc:0 "Klamath cannot be called too rich a settlement. There is a small amount of scrap metal and a lot of food, but nothing more. However, at least this is enough for us."
  den_occupationklamath: "Enlightened Teachers"
  den_occupationklamath_desc: "The people of Klamath call themselves civilized, but there's more to civilization than living in the  burnt-out ruins of a before-time town. We can set up a school for the poor people, if only they let us send a mayor to supervise them."
  den_rat_farms: "Tasty Protein"
  den_rat_farms_desc: "The molerats and geckos of Klamath are a tasty source of protein, we can contract farmers to start herding them. Tourists on a budget won't miss on this deal of a meal."
  den_core_klamath:0 "One More Little City"
  den_core_klamath_desc:0 "Klamath is one of the smaller towns in southern Oregon. He was known for the fact that a lot of gecko skins are mined there. Now he will be known as just one of the many towns under the control of New Reno."
  den_trade_arroyo:0 "Trade With Oregon"
  den_trade_arroyo_desc:0 "Oregon is a dangerous territory. Whoever is not there - tribal cannibals, raiders cannibals, supermutants cannibals and even more dangerous things. But this means that those who live further away are willing to pay even more for our goods. And the first stop on this journey north is Arroyo."
  den_slags_and_modoc: "Organic Farming"
  den_slags_and_modoc_desc: "Modoc's farms are the breadbasket of Northern Nevada, and are the reason our casinos' buffets are so amply stocked. Pay no heed to some steps to address outstanding supply issues."
  den_modoc_slavery:0 "Modoc Slavers Guild"
  den_modoc_slavery_desc:0 "Though quite a controversial action, enslaving the people of Modoc would help the Van Graffs out. We can simply take their food for our armies without paying for it, which all agree would be a cost-cutting measure."
  den_modoc_plantation: "New Farmsteads"
  den_modoc_plantation_desc: "Many share croppers in the NCR would be happy to come work up north. It ain't much, but it's honest work.  Is that the saying? We aren't really familiar with either lacking possessions or honest work so it's cute."
  den_pure_water:0 "Pure Fresh Water"
  den_pure_water_desc:0 "One of the few things why anyone even remembers slags is that they have access to a large underground lake with clean, radiation-free water. So let's build pipes from their lake to Reno!"
  den_subterrain_farms:0 "Slags Subterrain Farms"
  den_subterrain_farms_desc:0 "The second thing that does not allow you to forget about slags is their art in creating underground farms, where they grow a wide variety of mushrooms. This is almost for the majority, but also better. The more elite mushrooms are considered, the more we will receive from them."
  den_core_modoc: "Placing a Bet"
  den_core_modoc_desc: "The Slags is now under the sphere of Reno's influence, and can properly be brought into the fold. Constructing settlements out there is risky, but it is a bet we are willing to take."
  den_cityofsins: "City of Sins"
  den_cityofsins_desc: "New Reno has always been an independent city, and it will remain so in future. We do not intervene in conflicts between giants of Wasteland, but remain aloof from such nonsense. NCR is too stupid to attack us, and until then we can enjoy our independence."
  den_nevada: "Nevada Pact"
  den_nevadaa_desc: "With NCR we are not on the way. But at same time, it must be recognized that we can no longer exist independently. Not at a time when such giants as NCR and Legion are fighting. Therefore, we must take a closer look at the idea of Nevada Pact, a military alliance between most developed communities of Wasteland."
########## Den NCR war branch
  den_prepair_to_war:0 "Prepare for War with the Republic"
  den_prepair_to_war_desc:0 "New California Republic is now in dire straits due to the ongoing war against Caesar's Legion. What a fortunate development of events. Moreover, it will not hurt us at all to get Redding, which is so close to our border. Of course, attacking a strong opponent in the back is a coward's step. But there are two kinds of people - cowardly old people and brave corpses."
  den_blackmail_NCR:0 "Threaten the Republic"
  den_blackmail_NCR_desc:0 "The war against Caesar's Legion proved to be a real test for the New California Republic. However, it has been a long time since there have been wars between states of this size in the Wasteland. It can even be assumed that the Republic would not mind giving us Redding, for which we fought with them forty years ago. Republicans started this war to gain glory, but they will only bring shame."
  den_control_redding:0 "The Third City"
  den_control_redding_desc:0 "Redding is one of the largest cities in the Wasteland, one of the most important sources of gold in California, one of the last civilized cities on the way to Oregon. The last stronghold of civilization, through which food goes to the north and resources go to the south. And now we control this source of colossal wealth!"
  den_sale_jet_redding:0 "Weakness of Miner's Soul"
  den_sale_jet_redding_desc:0 "Redding has always suffered from drug addiction. Hard work, low wages and constant danger have always been the reasons that drive people to drugs. We may well use this. Let's give them what they want, forcing them to work harder and harder for the opportunity to buy a new dose of the drug."
  den_redding_riches:0 "Treasures of Redding"
  den_redding_riches_desc:0 "The Redding mines are some of the most important in all of California, where gold is mined. Without this gold, the Republic dollar is not backed by anything. They will be forced to buy it from us, even if they hate us after losing their mine. A good reason to increase production as much as possible."
  den_entertaiment_redding:0 "Meal'n'Real"
  den_entertaiment_redding_desc:0 "Redding's entertainment industry is one of the few growing industries in the city. We can even help develop it. It helps to calm down the population, to remind them that there is also rest. And they will also spend the money they earn on those enterprises that belong to us."
  den_local_redding:0 "A Local Viceroy"
  den_local_redding_desc:0 "We were able to run Den as a colony. In fact, this city was her - the center for the distribution of slaves before being sent to the surrounding plantations. Redding is a completely different case. We need someone local to run this city on our behalf. Someone familiar with local affairs who can respond promptly to events."
  den_van_graff_redding:0 "Family Homecoming"
  den_van_graff_redding_desc:0 "We were able to run Den as a colony. In fact, this city was her - the center for the distribution of slaves before being sent to the surrounding plantations. Redding is a completely different case. What a blessing that we have the Van Graff family who can manage the city for us, and with whom we have collaborated more than once. They will be extremely happy to return to their home."
  den_crown_redding:0 "The Crown Jewel of a New Empire"
  den_crown_redding_desc:0 "Redding gradually became the second most important city in our criminal empire, second only to our capital - New Reno. Now this is no longer just the possession of one city, now we can be called a small, but full-fledged state."
########## Den Rebecca branch
  den_rebecca_story_1:0 "The Chosen Den"
  den_rebecca_story_1_desc:0 "The Chosen One's role in the Den's history shaped the foundation our city now stands on. The Den was once a cesspit of the wasteland's scum but the end of the Slaver's Guild and our local gangs at the hands of the Chosen One reshaped our future."
  den_rebecca_story_2:0 "The Mordino's Refuge"
  den_rebecca_story_2_desc:0 "Twenty years ago the Mordinos came to our battered city in search of a new pearl to place their claim on after being battered out of Reno. Ever since their arrival they have tried relaying the seeds of criminality in our humble city."
  den_rebecca_story_3:0 "Lil' Jesus Wept"
  den_rebecca_story_3_desc:0 "A great day for the hopeful and moral folk of the Den arrived: New Reno won against the Mordino's border forces and anxiety is clouding the thoughts of Lil' Jesus. While not everything in the Den's future is certain it can only go upwards from here."
  den_rebecca_economic_1:0 "Freedom for Slaves"
  den_rebecca_economic_1_desc:0 "Rebecca has wisely chosen to free all slaves that fell under the grasp of the evil Mordinos, those that were never cared for by the regime and were its greatest victims."
  den_rebecca_economic_2:0 "Welcoming Migrants"
  den_rebecca_economic_2_desc:0 "Ever since the Mordino regime collapsed we have had an influx of the wasteland's disenfranchised folk, those that seek a home after theirs was destroyed. The Den was once a beacon of hate but now it stands as a beacon of freedom."
  den_rebecca_economic_3:0 "Creating Industry"
  den_rebecca_economic_3_desc:0 "The Den has always been scarce in the industrial department, the folks of the Den have not gotten the chance to know the benefits of industry at any scale. It's time we begin repairing the decaying factory floors."
  den_rebecca_economic_4:0 "Hard But Honest Work"
  den_rebecca_economic_4_desc:0 "The Den has never been a gem of any sorts, but now it may now be the only beacon of hope shining in Northern Nevada. Rebecca's leadership and the strength of our people has led us all to this moment."
  den_rebecca_military_1:0 "Our Own Weapon"
  den_rebecca_military_1_desc:0 "The Mordinos may have used their weapons to suppress the citizens of the Den but now we can use them to protect our city streets and arm our militias. Symbolism aside, our military will greatly benefit from this newly captured armament plant."
  den_rebecca_military_2:0 "Tribal Friends"
  den_rebecca_military_2_desc:0 "A group of wandering tribals have roamed the wasteland that worships fortune and everything that goes with it in search of their founder that they believe has gone to a golden casino paradise in the sky. While they may not have the clearest ideals they can certainly be friends of the Den, we will open our doors to them."
  den_rebecca_military_3:0 "The People's Militia"
  den_rebecca_military_3_desc:0 "While we may have a substantial militia force we will require more men and women fit for service if the Den's borders are to be protected. We will send out flyers and notices to all citizens about recruitment into the militia."
  den_rebecca_military_4:0 "Weapon Industry Of Nevada"

  den_rebecca_politic_1_desc:0 "While Reno may be the only reason the Den stands under Rebecca's careful rule we must none the less be wary against their advances. All the northern Nevadan fringe cities now fear a rule under Reno, perhaps we can unite them all for defense against them."
  den_rebecca_politic_slags_1:0 "Friends From Below"
  den_rebecca_politic_slags_1_desc:0 "The Slags have always been a misunderstood people, always being taken for ghosts or boogeymen and forced to hide underground from all the wasteland's threats. We sympathize with them and having them amongst our pact against Reno would be very benificial."

  den_rebecca_politic_modoc_1_desc:0 "Modoc has always been a lovely little town that what it lacked in size it made up for in the character of its people. Having them in our alliance would benefit us greatly in the economic department."

  den_rebecca_politic_klamath_1_desc:0 "Klamath has had a long history of Gecko Hunting and has had legendary tales of the Chosen One it has told for years. While its toxics caves and reptilian pests are not an asset the perseverance of Klamath's people proves they have a place in the Northern Nevadan Alliance."

  den_rebecca_politic_klamath_2_desc:0 "Klamath has agreed to a place in our alliance in exchange for thirteen caravans full of civilian and military machinery for their abandoned and rotting factories. A strong ally will be the difference between victory and defeat against Reno."

  den_rebecca_end_1_desc:0 "The Den was once a slaver town filled with nothing but miscreants and folks that had their place in hell reserved for them. After our departure from drugs and slavery the Den has seen what true representation feels like, we have truly come so far."
  den_rebecca_end_2:0 "New Biggest Little City"
  den_rebecca_end_2_desc:0 "They always call Reno the biggest little city in the world but with current developments the Den is taking its endearing nickname. While Reno may have tried to undermine the will of the Den's free folk they are none the less people we should respect. We will leave Reno as an independent city while taking some of its former northern territories."
