  lushanya_desc:0 "Lushanya Harjo is the heiress of one of the largest casino families in the coalition. She had a relative peaceful upbringing, but was trained and schooled in all manner of things that made their family as long lasting and successful as they are. She had a short reasonable successful career as a lounge singer, before the death of her parents at the hand of a raider incursion put her into a position where she had to take over the business and the de facto leadership of the coalition earlier than anyone expected."

  cmc_light_up_the_night:0 "Light up the Night"
  cmc_light_up_the_night_desc:0 "The Casinos we run eat up a lot of power with all their lights and machines. So much so that we often get brown outs in either the casinos themselves, or other areas of the city. We need to rig up a couple more generators to keep that from happening."
  cmc_casino1:0 "Red River Casino"
  cmc_casino1_desc:0 "A traditional casino with all the machines and tables you expect. It was famous before the war for being the largest casino in the Plains Commonwealth.\nInvesting in it will bring a disused wing of the casino back into full use, increasing the floorspace of the casino by almost 50%."
  cmc_casino2:0 "The Stingwing Clan Resort and Casino"
  cmc_casino2_desc:0 "While still having all the usual games, the Stingwing focuses more on leisure and entertainment. Bands, magicians and various other stage acts perform nightly, luring locals and tourists alike into spending money on drinks and food.\nInvesting in the Stingwing will allow us to open an attached hotel, meaning guests will stay longer and spend more money at the bar. Plus additional income from rent and room service."
  cmc_casino3:0 "Ibofanga Casino"
  cmc_casino3_desc:0 "The Ibofanga casino likes to put on a good show. Everything they do is themed after the traditional myths and culture of our people. People dress in traditional garb and guests can take part in 'ceremonies' pacifying the spirits...and bringing good fortune when gambling. The spirits just love small monetary donations.\n Investing in the Ibofanga will allow us to install an impressive light show displaying the 'spirits', and allowing them (over hidden speakers) to announce new shows and happy hour at the bar."
  cmc_along_the_route:0 "Roadside Attractions"
  cmc_along_the_route_desc:0 "The casinos are not the only things that will bring people to travel here. There are many smaller places along the route that will attract tourists and keep them in the area."
  roadside_attraction_tt:0 "§gEvery roadside attraction you open increases your casino payout slightly and reduces the chance of bad events.§!"
  cmc_the_pops:0 "The Pops"
  cmc_the_pops_desc:0 "A museum of soda. So many different brands of soda. Just... so many. We didn't even know there was anything else besides Bawls and Nuka Cola. \nApart from the fact that it will look really nice once it is lit up again, it's a veritable treasure trove of bottle caps."
  cmc_ritas_cafe:0 "Rita's Cafe"
  cmc_ritas_cafe_desc:0 "Apparently way more common on the west coast before the war, Rita's Cafe was a popular chain of restaurants that had a distinct 'futuristic' look. Well, the future turned out a bit different than people imagined. Anyway, as far as we can tell this is the only of it's kind in this region and it would bring a great boon to the area if we would bring it back to life."
  cmc_largest_peanut:0 "World's Largest Peanut?"
  cmc_largest_peanut_desc:0 "We found a travel brochure mentioning that the 'World's Largest Peanut' was supposed to be in the area. That sounds exciting! So we sent out a team to find it. Turns out the actual thing is...slightly underwhelming. But, hey, at least it's small enough for two people to carry it and an attraction is still an attraction."
  cmc_40_miles_of_bad_road:0 "40 Miles of Bad Road"
  cmc_40_miles_of_bad_road_desc:0 "A lot of the roads in our nation are in pretty bad condition, but still mostly serviceable, even with motorized equipment. We could try to make motorbikes and cars more readily available to the general populace. We heard much of the sacred tradition of the 'used car dealer'. Maybe it's time to revive it."
  cmc_cab_driver_once_more_down_the_street:0 "Cab Driver, Once More Down The Street"
  cmc_cab_driver_once_more_down_the_street_desc:0 "Here is a thought: public transport. Taxi cabs and buses. Our patrons have to get from their hotels to the casinos somehow. And nobody really likes arriving tired because they had to walk a long distance."

  cmc_going_to_the_river:0 "Going to the River"
  cmc_going_to_the_river_desc:0 "Even though most of our income stems from gambling, it's not a reliable long term plan for growth. The other option we have is expanding our influence along the Red River, so we can use it to for fishing and trade. To accomplish this, we need to deal with the potential hostile groups that have settled along it. And maybe we can settle some old grudges in one fell swoop."
  cmc_going_to_the_river_tt:0 "§gThe focuses following this wargoal are gated behind letting the criminals take over or not. So be aware of that before you puppet a nation.§!"
  cmc_an_old_grudge:0 "An Old Grudge"
  cmc_an_old_grudge_desc:0 "Almost 100 years ago the Scrappers Compact took some land from us, when we were struggling with the aftermath of a series of tornados sweeping through our nation. They have defended it fiercely ever since. We want that land back. But we don't need to be unreasonably cruel about it. We can give them a choice."
  cmc_americas_biggest_scrapyard:0 "America's Biggest Scrapyard"
  cmc_americas_biggest_scrapyard_desc:0 "Pushed back to the center of the maze of junk that used to be 'Americas Biggest Scrapyard', we gave the Scrapper Council a choice: join us or be driven out. They chose the smart option, but not without grumbling and wanting to start a fist fight about it. But that seems to be the normal course of action for them. Which means we got our land back and got a reluctant 'ally' out of it. In the long term this will be to both of our advantage."
  cmc_so_much_scrap:0 "So Much Scrap"
  cmc_so_much_scrap_desc:0 "After beating the warriors of the Compact and scattering them to the wind, we now have access to the largest pile of scrap metal in the area. This will take a concentrated effort to claim and process. And we have to deal with the occasional remnants of Scrapper resistance cells springing out of the ground, sometimes literally."
  cmc_last_lodge:0 "The Secret Handshake"
  cmc_last_lodge_desc:0 "The [TLL.GetName] has been occupying the south side of the red river for a long while. So far they haven't shown any signs of aggression and seem content with protecting the settlements under their control. As far as our record show, there was never any open conflict between our nations. Maybe we should turn this unofficial truce into an official one. This will also open up both nation for more trade."
  cmc_cypher:0 "Stopping the Crusade"
  cmc_cypher_desc:0 "The Masons turned out to be harmless and the Compact was never a big threat. The Cypher Warband on the other hand is a threat to everyone they consider to have fallen to the 'evils of technology'. We are not sure who they think that includes, but we better strike first before they consider us being part of that group."
  cmc_red_river_economic_zone:0 "Red River Economic Zone"
  cmc_red_river_economic_zone_tt:0 "Reduces the §Ycoring cost§! of states along the §YRed River§! by §G30%§!."
  cmc_the_lawson_experience:0 "The Lawson Experience"
  cmc_the_lawson_experience_desc:0 "It took some effort, but we finally managed to convince the council of Scrapper clan chiefs to move out of the old oil tanker. We can now return it to it's original use. Well, secondary use.\nCome join us and experience the rusty charm and industrial aesthetics of the Lawson Experience, newest casino of the Coalition. And the Compact gets some compensation out of the deal too."
  cmc_long_term_operations:0 "Long Term Operations"
  cmc_long_term_operations_desc:0 "We are here to stay, the Scrappers Compact resistance fighters are not. We can't have them constantly harassing our scavengers and transports. We need to find a way to deal with them."

  cmc_the_choir_awakens:0 "The Choir Awakens"
  cmc_the_choir_awakens_desc:0 "A song is echoing from the west. Many of our citizens have talked about weird dreams or vivid hallucinations. [CMC.GetLeader] has reported one such dream herself. The dreams show something terrible, but oddly alluring awakening. We must prepare."
  cmc_patrols_end:0 "Last of the Last Patrol"
  cmc_patrols_end_desc:0 "Our fears were proven right. The [TLP.GetName] has been...consumed by what we now know as the [CHC.GetName]. Some refugees managed to escape, but there are alarmingly few of them. They talk about friends and family suddenly taking up arms against each other or just starting to chant or gibber madly."
  cmc_scrapper_hive:0 "Scrapper Hive"
  cmc_scrapper_hive_desc:0 "The [SCA.GetName] were always a hive of hermits and scavengers, hiding in a maze of remnants of the old world. Now, they are part of an actual hive, controlled by beings we can't even begin to understand. Right next to our borders. We need more men at that border. As soon as possible."
  cmc_the_choir_sings:0 "The Choir Sings"
  cmc_the_choir_sings_desc:0 "The song in our dreams is getting louder, unbearably so. If we want to prevent what has happened to the other nations, we must strike before it is too late. For all of us."
  cmc_nothing_left_standing:0 "Leave Nothing Left Standing"
  cmc_nothing_left_standing_desc:0 "We have beaten back the Choir. Now we stand in the place the song originated from. The only solution we could think of is to throw as much explosives down this god forsaken hole in the ground as we can gather. Then if the song does not stop, throw in some more. No more singing. No more choir. Just explosions and then silence."
  cmc_nothing_left_standing_tt:0 "§PWe almost got used to the song. Feels weird without it.§!"

  cmc_family_business:0 "Family Business"
  cmc_family_business_desc:0 "My name is Lushanya Harjo. My family has been one of the leading groups of our people since before what our forefathers called 'The Smoke and the Fire'. We were the first out of the bunkers and we were the first to re-open one of the great casinos in the area. That is our legacy. And I will build on that legacy."
  cmc_pitboss:0 "The Pit Boss"
  cmc_pitboss_desc:0 "Uncle Liam has been the Pit Boss for the Red River Casino since before I was born. He has been an advisor to my parents and he is one to me currently. If there is something going on, either in the casino or in the area at large, he is the first to know."
  cmc_black_sheep:0 "The Black Sheep"
  cmc_black_sheep_desc:0 "Aspen is... she always was the odd one out. Didn't take well to a floor job in one of the casinos. Didn't want to have to do anything with the logistic and management side of it either. And after our parents died, she fell in with certain people that... let's say I wouldn't usually let them step inside one of our casinos. But she is still family. And it is one of my duties to see our family prosper."
  cmc_unrest_in_the_house:0 "Unrest in the Houses of Light"
  cmc_unrest_in_the_house_desc:0 "Some of our family are discontent with how the nation is currently run. While business is going strong, they are still questioning me at every point. Arguing for allowing hard chems in casinos and slavery being allowed. There seems to be a division forming between those that support me and those who follow these radical ideas."
  cmc_the_criminal_element:0 "The Criminal Element"
  cmc_the_criminal_element_desc:0 "Sadly there was always a somewhat organized criminal underground in our nation. Considering the situation back then it sprung up surprisingly quick after we resettled this area. Now though it seems to be on the rise. Most likely fueled by those members of my family that tend to see their activities in a more favourable light."
  cmc_respectable_business:0 "Respectable Business"
  cmc_respectable_business_desc:0 "We never actually drew up a proper law specifying what casinos can and can not get away with. If I want this place to be a destination for people from all of the wasteland, I can't afford to have it get a bad reputation."
  cmc_armed_bouncers:0 "Armed Bouncers"
  cmc_armed_bouncers_desc:0 "One thing that I need to do to keep a positive image for the area is getting our bouncers geared up so they can deal with any situation and keep undesirables out of our casinos. Before the war bouncers mostly had to deal with drunken people starting a brawl. Nowadays the brawl may include heavy weaponry."
  cmc_patrol_the_Streets:0 "Patrol the Streets"
  cmc_patrol_the_Streets_desc:0 "If I expand the number of our bouncers enough I can actually make them not only guard the casinos, but patrol the surrounding area too. This is making it safer for everyone and actually allowing more people to get here safely. And some of them may even decide to stay here permanently."
  cmc_independent_police_force:0 "An Independent Police Force"
  cmc_independent_police_force_desc:0 "I realized that our bouncers are already acting as a police force in our nation. Convincing enough people to make this officially the case shouldn't be too hard. Setting up an independent force that is not directly tied to any casino or other group allows us to efficiently combat crime and corruption. This will send a clear message to my detractors on what i believe should happen to dealers and slavers."
  cmc_independent_police_force_tt:0 "Police Chief §YHudson Caldron§! becomes available for service."
  cmc_law_prevails:0 "§GThe Law prevails.§!"
  cmc_criminals_pulling_strings:0 "§RCriminals are pulling the strings.§!"
  cmc_taking_a_cut:0 "Taking a Cut"
  cmc_taking_a_cut_desc:0 "Certain elements in the nation that like to stay in shadows have their fingers in the proceedings of a lot of the casinos. Supplying the owners with things outlawed in our nation or blackmailing them about things they would not like the public to know. I am aware of this, but it's hard to do anything against it."
  cmc_sponsor_chem_pushers:0 "Sponsoring the Chem Pushers"
  cmc_sponsor_chem_pushers_desc:0 "Lately a large wave of chems has made it to our nation. The dealers are not limiting themselves to back alleys any more. Instead you can buy various chems at casino bars, or if you like to be a bit more discrete have them delivered to your hotel room."
  allow_chem_abilities_tt:0 "This will allow your unit leaders to use chem abilities during combat."
  cmc_good_business:0 "Every Business is Good Business"
  cmc_good_business_desc:0 "A slave guild has made it's home in our nation. They present themselves as a legitimate business, but they still trade in people. I was against them setting up shop, but was overruled. So far the people they sell come from outside our nation. But this may change in the future."
  cmc_protection_price:0 "Protection has its Price"
  cmc_protection_price_desc:0 "The undesirable elements in our nation are acting more and more overt. They promise they will 'protect' casinos, hotels and other business from all manner of accidents that may happen. Just for a small regular payment. People that did not pay tended to have their property suffer from such things as additional bullet holes in structure and staff or spontaneous unexplained explosions."
  cmc_a_night_to_remember:0 "A Night to Remember"
  cmc_a_night_to_remember_desc:0 "Our people will remember this night for a long time. I will for sure."

  cmc_proving_her_name:0 "Proving Her Name"
  cmc_proving_her_name_desc:0 "I was the one that pushed the knife in her throat. It wasn't my first kill of the night and it wasn't the last. Much blood was spilled, a lot of it by my family members, on whichever side they ended up on in the end. I will carry the scars and the lessons from that night with me for the rest of my life."
  cmc_rooting_out_corruption:0 "Rooting Out Corruption"
  cmc_rooting_out_corruption_desc:0 "Even if the majority of the big players that attacked us that night have fallen either during the attack or in the various skirmishes that followed the next few days, a few escaped, lying low. But I will find them. I will never have it come this far again. This ends now."
  cmc_preemptive_measures:0 "Pre-emptive Measures"
  cmc_preemptive_measures_desc:0 "We need a better information network if we want to prevent anything like this ever happening again. Liam was always good with ferreting out information. Maybe it's time to give him some more funding and people to really let that ability shine."
  cmc_preemptive_measures_liam_tt:0 "Chief of Surveillance §YLiam§! becomes available for service."
  cmc_bird_in_a_cage:0 "Bird in a Cage"
  cmc_bird_in_a_cage_desc:0 "Liam is dead. Most of my supporters are too. The ones that aren't are held hostage. They decided to keep me alive. To parade around. To be a public face that people know. No options, no way out. I have to do what they tell me to do until some opportunity presents itself."
  cmc_crime_does_pay:0 "Crime Does Pay"
  cmc_crime_does_pay_desc:0 "Right now, in what used to be my office there are 5 people i would love to see dead. The heads of the biggest gangs and criminal syndicates that led to the downfall of everything my family and I have established. And among them sitting like a queen is Aspen, having earned her place by facilitating the attacks and ferrying information to the right people. Plotting to squeeze this nation dry."
  cmc_new_queen_of_the_red_river:0 "The New Queen of the Red River"
  cmc_new_queen_of_the_red_river_desc:0 "Things have turned out well for Aspen. She is living the high life, drinking fancy drinks and eating expensive food. Proclaiming she is now doing my job, like she always deserved: managing the Red River Casino. Most of the actual work is done by either hired henchmen from one of the gangs or workers that were there before the takeover and now have to work for fear of their lives"
  cmc_new_queen_of_the_red_river_tt:0 "§YAspen, Queen of the Red River§! becomes available for service."
  cmc_looking_for_entertainment:0 "Looking for Entertainment"
  cmc_looking_for_entertainment_desc:0 "After a night like that, everyone could use some distraction. What better way than a good movie. And i just know the place where we can get some.\nIf the future isn't bright, at least it's colourful."
  cmc_looking_for_an_escape:0 "Looking for an Escape"
  cmc_looking_for_an_escape_desc:0 "They say that there is money to be made in providing entertainment. The [TUB.GetName] have been in the business for a while. I am supposed to visit them to iron out a contract. They provide new movies and music, we provide money, the infrastructure and a way for them to spread their media empire. Of course I will be accompanied by my 'bodyguards'. Wouldn't want anything to happen to me, you know.\nWe'll see."
  cmc_looking_for_love:0 "Looking for Love"
  cmc_looking_for_love_desc:0 "The visit turned out very different from what I expected. From what we both expected, I guess."
  cmc_another_night_to_remember:0 "Another Night to Remember"
  cmc_another_night_to_remember_desc:0 "Not every night that is worth remembering has to be as unpleasant as the infamous one. This one was the very opposite of that."
  cmc_shared_bonds:0 "Shared Bonds"
  cmc_looking_for_closure:0 "Looking for Closure"
  cmc_looking_for_closure_desc:0 "I think it is time to put the events of that night behind me. They will not be forgotten, but dwelling on them won't help me or my people. There are bigger things to consider. I must plan for the future. For all of us."
  cmc_looking_for_revenge:0 "Looking for Revenge"
  cmc_looking_for_revenge_desc:0 "We came to an understanding. The 'technicians' that [TUB.GetLeader] will send back with my little entourage will pack more than the tools to set up some movie screens and broadcast towers. Once they are in place to secure the hostages, more are waiting just far enough away to avoid detection. \nI will reclaim my empire."
  cmc_previous_commitments:0 "Previous Commitments"
  cmc_previous_commitments_desc:0 "[TUB.GetLeader] has made some previous deals with the [TBH.GetName], which made the Tubeheads fall under their control. Situations change and i think it's time to make it clear for everyone that we stand together. It might cost the Coalition a fair bit to renege on his contract with them. So be it."

  cmc_open_casino_tt:0 "This will increase the number of fully running casinos by §G1§!."
