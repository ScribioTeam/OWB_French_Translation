  ENT_TOLLKEEPER_NAME:0 "The Tollkeeper"
  ENT_TOLLKEEPER_DESC:0 "Even in a place as forbidding as the Canadian Rockies, trade will continue to flow, and Entrance stands as the literal gateway between those mountains and the lands of Whitecourt and beyond. It is the Tollkeepers duty to ensure that trade continues to flow, that a cut of each deal is taken, and good relations are maintained with the powers to the east and north. It is a thankless duty, but a necessary one."
