  grd_advanced_recruitment_strategies: "\"Advanced Recruitment Strategies\""
  grd_advanced_recruitment_strategies_desc: "Ultimately, the Guardians have only flourished as an offshoot of Lost Hills for so long as a result of our recruitment strategies. Ultimately we need to reach out to other groups in the wasteland if we wish to expand our number.\nThere were some raiders up to the north, they could use some with education!"
  grd_vip_wg: "\"Recruiting\" the Vipers"
  grd_vip_wg_desc: "The Vipers might seem a strange group to reach out to to train their young into Guardians, what with their strange cultist ways. Nothing a bit of elbow grease can’t fix! The grease being painful discipline, and the elbows being them, of course."
  grd_ykz_wg: "\"Recruiting\" the Yakuza"
  grd_ykz_wg_desc: "The Yakuza, when they are beaten and working under us, will do well to serve as new recruits. Their strange language will serve as a signalling tool so that, as scouts, they can communicate without the risk of others hearing in."

  grd_jac_wg_desc: "The bloodthirsty jackals may have a strange appetite for.. human flesh, but if anything is true its the fact that a man with a vice can be controlled like any dog.

  grd_sok_deep_integration_desc: "'Kaga', as he was known, was practically a god to the Sons. If we ever hope to reach out to these tribals we will need to strip them of this false mysticism, bring out the good in them yet so that they might turn their lives around and work for something grander."

  grd_tof_deep_integration_desc: "The 215th, once a group of prisoners from the town of Jericho, could prove pivotal to our furthering as an institution! A raider is a weak-willed creature, and by offering them safety and an outlet for their rage might we (yet) convert them to a higher calling."

  grd_armory_and_workshop: "Armoury and Workshop Quarters"
  grd_armory_and_workshop_desc: "The Citadel has always functioned off of the back of those willing to fight and work for its safety. Among the Guardians it is the workshop where the weapons we use to strike down wastelanders are made, and the armoury where the hardened T-51c is embossed with our grand sigil."
