  mod_jo_leader_desc: "Once a man you could best describe as 'perfectly average' and voted into office because nobody else wanted to, Jo had to drastically change his attitude towards his position after the trade agreement with the nearby Slags helped Modoc through a drought that almost led to it's downfall.\nThe following years the cooperation between the two groups made the farming business in the area flourish, leading to Modoc supplying a lot of nearby settlements with food and other goods. This put it on the map for various caravan companies, making the once sleepy town into a popular stop on the Big Circle route between trading hubs in the NCR and destinations further east like Vault City.\n\nNowadays there isn't a single day without a caravan entering or leaving the town.\n\nAnd while Jo used to be trader, sheriff, mayor and whatever else was needed, he now is very comfortable as his position of 'just' the mayor.\n\nThere are finally enough people willing to do the other jobs."
