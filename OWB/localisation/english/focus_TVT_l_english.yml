  tvt_opening_up_desc: "It seems, actually, that the Director included a curious little button for us. A plan that the Director had been cooking up for years! It would have involved using the underlying infrastructure around Esmeralda to hook into TV-Town's central networking, causing the city to effectively expand rapidly through a mix of Fluxdrift automated machinery and forced relocation of material goods. Prefabricated homes for all of the Android masses! What wasn't to like?"

A real Utopia for Androids - the paradise all Runners had been fighting for."

The Runners have done quite a lot in these years since their victory over the Director! Still, one matter must be resolved; that of the ultimate purpose of Android's, and our Utopia as a whole. Are we destined to rule this world, defeating the human animal.. or are we destined for something greater?"

  tvt_wg_sky: "A History of Regret"
  tvt_wg_sky_desc: "The human animal is a sad case, as they could have done such good with the time they have had on this world! Built wonders, nurtured nature, laughed and loved and truly, truly cherished their limited days. They didn't. They were a people of war, callous, unbridled conflict that never seemed to end. With every step they took towards perfection they took two more towards their doom."
