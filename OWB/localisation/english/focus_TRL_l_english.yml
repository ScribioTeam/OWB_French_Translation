  trl_secholotape_desc:0 "Driven into deeper desperation by his growing mental instability, the violence he felt growing in his heart, the man that would become the First left a second recording, a guiding message for himself as he saw more and more people flocking to his impromptu abode. He was a soldier still, it was his duty and honour to protect these people, and he would be damned if he forgot that."

  trl_thirdholotape:0 "The Third Holotape"
