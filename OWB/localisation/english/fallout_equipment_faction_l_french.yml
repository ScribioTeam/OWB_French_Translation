 ARM_ballistic_equipment_2_short:0 "Fusil AM"
 ARM_ballistic_equipment_2_desc:0 "Peu d'adversaires considéreraient un fusil de chasse comme dangereux, mais ils se trompent lourdement. Sa menace vient du fait qu'il s'agit d'un bolt-action réaménagé, conçu pour tirer une cartouche anti-matériaux raccourcie capable de transpercer la plupart des obstacles, et même les armures légères. Ce qu'il gagne en recul, il le compense par sa puissance de feu."

Le cadre renforcé, l'absence de crosse et le profil court en font une arme parfaite pour les fusillades en voiture, ainsi que pour défoncer l'orbite de quelqu'un. Ajoutez une baïonnette, et vous obtenez un merveilleux éviscérateur de poche."

The handle is made of polished bones, imbued with tainted blood to give it a red color, while a wave-bladed edge gives it a horribly wounding effect on strike, akin to a serrated edge.

#  CHC_melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "More commonly seen in the hands of prisoners trying to silence snitches than as mass produced weapon of war, the prison shiv is a simple improvised blade made primarily for piercing and stabbing than slashing at foes. It's deadly nature comes from the vicious tactics used alongside it, with wearers used to go for the jugular or arteries than fight fair."

 CHC_ballistic_equipment_1_short:0 "9mm SMG"
 CHC_ballistic_equipment_1_desc:0 "The 9mm submachine gun is a classic that hardly needs an introduction. Improving upon the basic package, a telescopic assembly reduces it's size further, while higher quality cartridges crafted with increased powder load allows enhanced muzzle velocity and effect on soft target.

With a good rate of fire for a manually-cycled weapon, high accuracy, and tweaked iron sights, its suited for just about any situation encountered in the wasteland. Chambered for the powerful .45-90 Express, the cartridge is made to take down large predators such as Yao-Guai, deathclaws, or idiots in heavy armor."

  CLK_ballistic_equipment_2_short:0 ".44 Improved"
 CLK_ballistic_equipment_2_desc:0 "Very little can be considered "improvement" when it comes to Clockwatcher weaponry, at least to them. As such, this sidearm was only called "Improved" when a crafty weaponsmith managed to have what amounts to a battle pistol fire a 350 grain, .44 cartridge without the whole gun going up with his hands. While pre-war movies tended to exaggerate their effect, this revolver can actually blow someone clear across a room"

 CLK_ballistic_equipment_3_desc:0 "There comes a point in every revolver development where a hard limit is, sadly, reached in terms of firepower. Thankfully, that's where carbine convertions generally come in. With a solid stock, center-line assembly and elongated barrel, this revolver carbine can not only provide a more stable firing platform, but increase firepower even further by firing a full-length, super magnum .44 cartridge more commonly seen fired from heavy rifles."

  CLK_ballistic_equipment_4_desc:0 "An extremely bulky yet curious contraption, this converted railway spike driver has been fitted with a stock, barrel, and stand-alone power unit to be able to fire it's spike at long range. When bullets could no longer satisfy the Clockwatcher's need for increased firepower, this was a natural choice for a replacement. The spike itself is propelled at revolver-like velocity, themselves being huge .62 caliber metal rods able to literally nail an enemy to a wall."
