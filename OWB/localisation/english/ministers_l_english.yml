On one cold night in the winter, a pirate raiding party took many of the villagers, including his parents, hostage. Unable to pay the hefty ransom, villagers mourned the loss of their loved ones. It was a pirate custom to raid the coast for slaves, kidnapping everyone for ransom and selling anyone who couldn't pay to slavers in Oregon. With nowhere to go, he turned to the military, enrolling in the NCR Military Academy. \n\n Combining his military knowledge with his quick wit, he quickly rose ranks in the NCR Military. When he chose to become an admiral everyone thought this was a career suicide, due to the neglect of the naval forces. His first task to blockade the Rapids from using the Colorado to reinforce their supplies failed due to the outdated naval doctrine of the Republic. NCR Navy consisted of big ironclad ships rebuilt from the US Navy, who proved ineffective at chasing the fast boats used by the enemy. NCR also lacked the marine corps, which meant some conscripts in the navy did not even know how to swim. Taking the initiative, he employed a tactic from his past. He conscripted many of the fishing boats in the NCR coast and led a night assault to Rapids docks, burning many of their ships, capturing many more. Cutting most of the enemies supply lines in an instant earned him a lot of respect in the military, especially the High Command. \n\n After being promoted to the rank of Admiral of the Navy, he began the modernization of the NCR Navy, creating the Naval Engineer Corps. With the engineers constantly producing new prototypes, guns and naval modules under his watchful eye, Doherty is pretty confident that when Legion strikes, NCR will be the one ruling the waves."
