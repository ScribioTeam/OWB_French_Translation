  nf_sok.1.t:0 "The Unchosen One"
  nf_sok.1.d:0 "Arroyo’s Chosen One was not the first to be elected to save their tribe and become their elder. There was another more fiery and furious candidate that was also trained from birth to take the title of Chosen One. However, the village chose to ignorantly cast him out and with incredible pain he accepted their terms. His departure also meant the exodus of hundreds of brave men and women who would follow his thread of the prophecy. These great warriors helped form the Sons of Kaga that would soon rule a swath of land in the Nevadan gauntlet.\n\nHis Journey was a long and arduous one, along the way he fought many trials. Having gained his signature colossal steel armour and power fist through combat he was truly unmatched on the battlefield. Now he must look ahead to the future struggles that could threaten the existence of his fledgling nation and sever his foretold prophecy."
  nf_sok.1.a:0 "Chosen or not we will prevail."
  nf_sok.1.b:0 "We must not harbour grudges."

  nf_sok.2.t:0 "New World Symphony"
  nf_sok.2.d:0 "The fight for power in Nevada is on the brink of spilling into all out war. We must find our place in this conflict lest we fall to the soulless tribes that surround us. Kaga first chose this place for its isolation from any evil and its similarity to his homeland, Arroyo. But over time more and more forces moved into the region, quickly becoming a gauntlet that would soon unpredictably rage with border conflicts and diplomatic nightmares. Ultimately Kaga must overcome this trial like he has any other, but will the pressure of outside forces cause his fury to crumble into agony?"
  nf_sok.2.a:0 "The outsiders know nothing of our past struggles, we can forgive their ignorance."
  nf_sok.2.b:0 "Kaga will not falter or fail."

  nf_sok.3.t:0 "Echoes From TV Town"
  nf_sok.3.d:0 "Every day, on every radio and television in the county only one channel would be active, and only one show would be on 24/7 - Carousel. Carousel is a strange show, showing the lives of strange machine-people as they about their fake-days, attempting to recreate the authenticity of human life. It wasn’t a very good illusion, very often the sorcery would fall apart and needed to be repaired. Still, the sight of those mechanical beasts gave Kaga a raging curiosity - what sort of evil demon could possibly have created such a mockery of human life?"
  nf_sok.3.a:0 "We must prepare to combat this devilry."
  nf_sok.3.b:0 "Fortify our borders with this menace."
