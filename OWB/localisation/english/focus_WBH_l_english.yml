  WBH_within_the_blizzard:0 "Within The Blizzard"
  WBH_within_the_blizzard_desc:0 "Within the perpetual snow of the north, there's a city unlike any other: a city inhabited by ghosts. They say that if you step foot in their city you never return. Those vengeful spirits loathe the living, their eyes burn like orange coals of distorted desire. Dragging you deep, deep into their dark heart, they make you one of them."

  WBH_sinister_patriots:0 "Sinister Patriots"
  WBH_sinister_patriots_desc:0 "\"The north is where men lose their sense,\" that's what they say. Stubborn prospectors who ignore danger, foolish youths following dreams of spun silver, and desperate men with nothing left to lose: these are the pilgrims of the north. Their one and only port of call before the Endless White is the Old Country, a nation of pre-war Ghouls who long for the days of yore."

  WBH_without_a_cause:0 "Without a Cause"
  WBH_without_a_cause_desc:0 "With the state of Washington firmly underneath his control, the Immortal's gaze wanders to the rebels of [TCA.GetNameDef] and their traitorous leader. A grim example must be made of both [TCA.GetLeader] and any who supported his impertinent betrayal."

  WBH_fellow_savages:0 "Fellow Savages"
  WBH_fellow_savages_desc:0 "Traders who brave the northern seas are as likely to curse Port Maw as they are to praise it. Small vessels are often molested in the open waters by pirates from Port Maw, their crews killed and their goods stolen. In darker corners of the port, pirates whisper about their dealings with ghosts. Slaves for guns, shiny things for lasers. Supposedly, one man even fished up an obelisk for them..."

  WBH_dark_ambitions:0 "Dark Ambitions"
  WBH_dark_ambitions_desc:0 "Sealed inside his armour, the Immortal has been leading his men since their days in the Midwestern Brotherhood. If his former Elder saw who he was today, he would be put down on the spot. The Immortal knows that he's been warped, changed, hollowed out. He doesn't lament what he's lost, and neither do the men who've followed him. They all know in their hearts that today's evil is tomorrow's good."

  WBH_enslave_the_weak:0 "Enslave The Weak"
  WBH_enslave_the_weak_desc:0 "Tribal families make excellent workers, that's what the Washington Brotherhood decided soon after they'd wrested control of Seattle from the few dregs inhabiting it. If they wanted to restore the city and its facilities to their former glory they'd need workers... workers who wouldn't complain, who couldn't complain. Slavery is just another mean towards their end: morality is worthless."

  WBH_expand_our_dominion:0 "Expand Our Dominion"
  WBH_expand_our_dominion_desc:0 "It's not enough for the Brotherhood to simply rest in their citadel buried in the heart of Seattle. They need more: more slaves, more resources, more facilities... more more more. That's what the Immortal tells his men, it's what he mumbles to himself every day. More. The engines of war are turning again, because the Immortal demands it."

  WBH_eradicate_the_mutants:0 "Hunting The First"
  WBH_eradicate_the_mutants_desc:0 "Although he may be a ghoul, the Immortal has no love for mutants: especially not Super Mutants. The First is perhaps the most troublesome of all - leading the Troll Warren along our southern border. Under him the Warren's rapid growth is turning them into a potential threat. We need to do whatever we can to bring him down and ensure that he doesn't serve as a road block to our plans."

  WBH_black_paladins:0 "Black Paladins"
  WBH_black_paladins_desc:0 "Enslaving the weak and putting them to work isn't enough, we need to police them too. The strongest are picked to keep their brethren in line, and slowly but surely they begin to slip into our grasp. Once they're cruel and broken we take them into our ranks, burning the seal into their flesh. Black Paladins of the Washington Brotherhood are truly a terribly sad thing."

  WBH_decimate_and_despoil:0 "Decimate And Despoil"
  WBH_decimate_and_despoil_desc:0 "Mercy isn't a virtue, it's a weakness. The Immortal taught us this during the long journey to Seattle, he showed us the true path, a path of suffering and victory. All who cannot be forced to work must be purged. There's no room for compassion in this frozen wasteland."

  WBH_dark_foundries:0 "Dark Foundries"
  WBH_dark_foundries_desc:0 "Deep within our facility lies an infernal machine whose engine burns like spent fire. It desires blood and coal. We will build a great cathedral of wrought iron and bloody furnaces to wake its slumbering heart, so that it may gaze upon our desecration and reward us justly."

  WBH_death_or_glory:0 "Death Or Glory"
  WBH_death_or_glory_desc:0 "We came to the north knowing that our lives were forfeit, that there was no turning back once we left our former chapter. Seattle is a harsh mistress, her frosts threaten to destroy your servos and chill your bones - but her cold touch preserves the lost world. We have nothing left to lose, and everything left to gain."

  WBH_alaskan_expedition:0 "Great Alaskan Expedition"
  WBH_alaskan_expedition_desc:0 "Finally. Finally it's time to fulfil the Immortal's dream. Our scouts have been scouring Alaska for his objective, and they found it. Buried into the side of a mountain, covered in ice, a bulkhead waits to be opened. It's time to send an expedition to reclaim that lost place."

  WBH_attack_the_warren:0 "Attack the Warren"
  WBH_attack_the_warren_desc:0 "The Warren have shown us that they will grow exceptionally if left unchecked. We will need to push south and launch a invasion if we are to prevent them from launching a pre-emptive strike on our own. Its not genocide, its mercy."
