  UNB_CRAW_NAME:0 "Craw The Eviscerator"
  UNB_CRAW_DESC:0 "Even a raider can have dreams of something great and pure, and Craw’s dreams are not small ones. Apart from his ambitious hopes of molding the Unbound into a raider clan to be feared all across the Great Shield, Craw dreams of soaring amongst the clouds. Inspired by the high-flying riders of the storm and their gifts, the Eviscerator hopes one day to ascend as they have with or without the rest of the gang. Doesn’t really matter to him who has to die along the way to make these dreams come true."
