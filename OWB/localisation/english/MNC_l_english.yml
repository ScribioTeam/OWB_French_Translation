  mnc_montana1:0 "Patrocolus' Charge"
  mnc_montana1_desc:0 "Patrocolus was entrusted with a mission of utmost urgency: to trail one of the most recent and notorious traitors in the Midwestern Brotherhood."

  mnc_montana2:0 "The Sisters of Steel"
  mnc_montana2_desc:0 "A rag-tag unofficial order within the Midwestern hierarchy, the Sisters were named as such thanks to their foremost members: Paladin Minerva and Sentinel Honour, the latter of whom earned who had earned her peculiar rank for her bravery and successful efforts against Enclave skirmishes back in Chicago. Though largely social outcasts, many of their members are among the Brotherhood elite-- though unfortunately, in recent times, they've been disgraced by the actions of their own. Seeking rebirth in Montana, many of them feel they have something to prove in the times to come."

  mnc_montana3:0 "Family Matters"
  mnc_montana3_desc:0 "A little conversation on the way to Montana..."

  mnc_arrival_in_serendipity:0 "The Fort Verity Bunker"

  #Lusa, feel free to change this however you feel, if I disagree I can just fix it after nbd

  mnc_honorsplan:0 "Honour's Plan"
  mnc_honorsplan_desc:0 "After the events at the bunker, murmurs and whispers began to spread.  Fear and concern churn in the hearts of those uneasy under Patrocolus' order.  It is not enough to watch, nor enough to curse and bite our tongues. We need a new approach to the Brotherhood; §PHonour's plan§!."

  mnc_water:0 "Crystal Clear"
  mnc_water_desc:0 "The bunker's waterchip is near broken, worn down by age and the recent spike in use.  Truly a wonder how the old thing's been functioning at all.  Though reluctant at first, the denizens of the bunker have allowed us to look over the chip.  Let's see if we can bring back some clarity to the water."

  mnc_securingthebunker:0 "Every Stranger a New Friend"
  mnc_securingthebunker_desc:0 "Positive change begins with how we treat those outside of our ranks.  The bunker denizens have allowed us access to their produce.  Beside them, development on mass-spread cultivation methods can begin.  This trust will not be taken for granted."

  mnc_townhall:0 "Steel Ghosts"
  mnc_townhall_desc:0 "After casting Patrocolus away, we thought the Midwestern Brotherhood would be a problem for later.  But our patrol units and citizens have reported strange activity along the edge of the border.  This requires our immediate investigation. Hopefully these shady silhouttes are nothing more than raiders..."

  mnc_unitybybrotherhood:0 "Unity in Sisterhood"
  mnc_unitybybrotherhood_desc:0 "The success of partnership, rather than ownership, over the bunker has proven fruitful beyond imagination.  Though §PHonour's§! shift in power bristled the Montanna chapter, spurring many Scribes, Knights and the sort to desert once her word was made true, the friendships established with the bunker keep kindled spirits.  Many have now accepted the title of Sister with wonder."

  #Left Branch - Helping folks, yadda yadda

  mnc_helpingtheneedy:0 "A Gander Over The Fence"
  mnc_helpingtheneedy_desc:0 "Having regained foothold within the Montana Chapter, it would not hurt to establish production near our borders.  It also provides us great leeway to see what our neighbouring nations are up to..."

  mnc_workingalongsidefarmers:0 "One Foot In The Soil"
  mnc_workingalongsidefarmers_desc:0 "To understand the tribulations of our workers grants our success as a whole.  Let's send a few Knights to the fields for some hands-on assistance.  This will lessen the burden of our farmers and common workers while providing an adequate report of stability."

  mnc_brotherhood_irrigation_program:0 "Gifts From The Sisters"
  mnc_brotherhood_irrigation_program_desc:0 "Montana is a home, a refuge for those in need, an opportunity for anyone, supported and crafted by the hands of the Sisters. We must push this image to civilians and wastelanders here and beyond.  Let us start with the basics; gifts and displays of virtue."

  mnc_brotherhoodinitiative1:0 "One Eye To The Sky"
  mnc_brotherhoodinitiative1_desc:0 "Ruined buildings of yore have their purposes, but it is not enough to lay a bedroll on the ground and call it home.  We are beyond barbaric as is; let us see to clearing old rubble and building new structures."

  mnc_brotherhoodinitiative3:0 "The Homestead Initiative"
  mnc_brotherhoodinitiative3_desc:0 "A livelier homstead is a greater one.  The Sisterhood is more than a force of reckoning; we are guardians with boldened hearts beneath our steel.  From hereon, the Sisterhood shall pledge community participation beyond military force.  A caretaker, a mentor, a volunteer-- we are what our people need us to be."

  #Ruminators Foci

  mnc_ruminators:0 "A Friend in Elizaveta"
  mnc_ruminators_desc:0 "§PHead In The Cloud's§! Log \n\nWe met the strange woman at the edge of the border.  The Knights on patrol humoured her, the citizens near found her endearing, and I shortly arrived per word of her request.  Her name was Elizaveta, leader of the Ruminators.  She offered me a gift basket-- fruits, canned goods, and flowers.  In return, I offered her an evening conversation over tea."

  mnc_ruminators_puppet:0 "Little Sisters"
  mnc_ruminators_puppet_desc:0 "§PHead In The Cloud's§! Log \n\nThe Ruminators bear hearts of gold.  They know no evil, but I fear that when they do, that gold and glitter of innocence would fade to ash.  As allies and friends, we cannot let catastrophic harm befall them.  Though I haven't known Elizaveta for long, if anything happened to her... Well, as Thrift would put it, 'guns would go blazing'."

  mnc_brotherhood_sponsors:0 "A Rhyme For The Joyful"
  mnc_brotherhood_sponsors_desc:0 "We've entrusted the Ruminators to continue their practices and activities under our protection and watch.  Elizaveta has welcomed our presence with open arms and broad smiles; excited to spread giggles and joy without the need of a weapon in her writing hand."

  mnc_ruminators_calling:0 "Songs Of The Lost"
  mnc_ruminators_calling_desc:0 "§PHead In The Cloud's§! Log \n\nElizaveta and her Ruminators, or what remained, arrived at our borders in the dead of night.  Elizaveta was collected, but her cheerful candor faded.  We took them in.  She spoke nothing of what happened.  I urged her none."

  #Khans

  mnc_thekhans:0 "Kindred Spirits, Alike In Infamy"
  mnc_thekhans_desc:0 "§RComing in 5.0!§!"

  #main branch, part 1

  mnc_rebootingthesistersofsteel:0 "Welding New Steel"
  mnc_rebootingthesistersofsteel_desc:0 "The days of conscription are over.  A Sister armed is a Sister devoted; a warrior who knows the price of battle and fights for a cause they believe in.  We've given the Sisters tired of battle, those taken into the Brotherhood without choice, a chance to live as civillians.  Together, we press forward, welding new steel for those who choose to bear its burdens."

  mnc_musterthesisters_1:0 "A Hand For The Loose Ends"
  mnc_musterthesisters_1_desc:0 "Before the steel, many Knights were tribunal.  Foremost, we should let these people voice their needs and concerns.  Should a day come where we dismiss the suffering we've inflicted, or of the many scars yet to heal, then let damnation unravel us.  For then--in our journey for greatness--have we forgotten to do good."

  mnc_musterthesisters_2:0 "Pledging Devotion"
  mnc_musterthesisters_2_desc:0 "In order to push forward, we need to prove that our devotion is beyond flimsy words and hollow ideals.  While Honour favors actions over words, it would be beneficial for our Sentinel to give public speeches and sit-down stories to share with her Knights."

  mnc_sisters_shall_stand_together:0 "Sister, Born In Murk, Risen In Steel"
  mnc_sisters_shall_stand_together_desc:0 "The Sisters who were once tribunals are slowly adapting to their freedom, while those taught intolerance are learning to bury old habits.  Progress is rocky, but one things stand true; we are all born in the murk of the world, and together, through unity and understanding, shall we rise in steel."

  mnc_reavers_legacy:0 "Bring Forth The Current"
  mnc_reavers_legacy_desc:0 "The Reavers of our ranks have requested advanced technologies for their inspection and practices.  This, they explain, will re-establish their connections with the 'current flow'.  Honour sees no harm in this, let's grant the Reavers their wish."

  mnc_reavers_legacy_2:0 "Commune With The Gods"
  mnc_reavers_legacy_2_desc:0 "After their latest string of successes, the Reavers have requested further clearence to our other technologies.  For too long have they been seperated with their Gods, let us restore this privilege."

  mnc_medicine_techniques:0 "Spirits And Shells"
  mnc_medicine_techniques_desc:0 "The study room we've granted the Revears are chalked brim with scematics and scribbled thoughts.  They've approached us with an experiment, promising breakthroughs in medicine and equipment."

  mnc_brotherhoodinitiative2:0 "Fuel For The Fire"
  mnc_brotherhoodinitiative2_desc:0 "Our resources are stretched thin by the troublesome Montana climate, more so during the winter months.  But there's hope in mending this, and that lies in the billowing smoke on the horizon. This 'Coal Consortium' to the west seems to believe Fort Verity falls under their purview, and have expressed distaste at our presence here. I am not violent by nature, but there is opportunity in their callousness..."

  mnc_coalconsortium_resistance:0 "Bandaid Solutions Won't Cut It"
  mnc_coalconsortium_resistance_desc:0 "Negotiating with Steven was a lost cause.  Pompously living in luxury, he hoarded his resources while others vied for scraps.  We urged him to share what he couldn't possibly need in his lifetime, but he remained stubborn.  That's fine.  If he couldn't do it, then we will."

  mnc_beastlords_legacy:0 "A Muted Birthright"
  mnc_beastlords_legacy_desc:0 "The children of the Beastlords absorbed into the Brotherhood nearly a century ago have paid enough for the actions of their ancestors.  These children only know pleasant tales; of their mothers and fathers living alongside the beasts of the wasteland.  Let's carefully ease them back into old traditions, sans the cannibalism."

  mnc_beastlords_legacy_2:0 "A Call Not Easily Forgotten"
  mnc_beastlords_legacy_2_desc:0 "Though scant, the descendents of the Beastlords exhibit minor psychic control over creatures.  Some have shown interest in exploring this ability.  It would be of great use to our cause.  Let's give them this chance."

  mnc_beastlords_exertions:0 "Return Of The Wilds"
  mnc_beastlords_exertions_desc:0 "Recently, patrols have recorded an influx of stray dogs wandering into our territories.  None of them were hostile, just friendly.  We've let the descendents of the Beastlords take in these dogs-- all of whom were overjoyed at the opportunity."

  #sister main story part 2

  mnc_sisters_thinking_bigger:0 "The Heist"
  mnc_sisters_thinking_bigger_desc:0 "Remnants of resistance and raiders have been taking shots at the wink links in our defenses.  We must endure as our forces acclimate to their new setting.  With these new resources, let us show these wicked remnants what we can do."

  mnc_sister_metalmouths_goal:0 "A Real Jawbreaker"
  mnc_sister_metalmouths_goal_desc:0 "Neighbouring the Metalmouths has risen concern.  Nobody is pleased with living close to a nation of raiders, no less slavers.  They wield valuable weapons for an unjust cause.  Let's fix that."

  mnc_sister_havre_goal:0 "Visiting The City" #Instead of warring against Havre, force them into being a puppet? -- or better yet, they send a messenger and that messenger gets murked
  mnc_sister_havre_goal_desc:0 "Havre is a quaint place and from our intel it is populated by mere tribals and settlers.  Though, as a nation, they lack tight-knit order.  We could grant the citizens of Havre the protection and leadership they'll need.  Our brightest Paladins and sharpest Scribes could sort things out."

  mnc_metalmouths_scavenging:0 "Picking Up The Pieces"
  mnc_metalmouths_scavenging_desc:0 "Comitting to our no-conscription policy has left us to deal with trickling raiders.  We'll need to be on high alert and expend more effort into surpressing the rest of the resistence."

  mnc_havre_acclimation:0 "Cross-Hearted"
  mnc_havre_acclimation_desc:0 "With Havre under Sisterhood control, we're raring to get to work and pave way a greater home for the people of Havre.  Our forces will be sent in at any moment's notice!"

  mnc_sisters_pitching_the_flag:0 "Streak The Sky With Colour"
   mnc_sisters_pitching_the_flag_desc:0 "§PHead In The Cloud's§! Log \n\nScribe Silfer has approached me with new ideas regarding our flag -- the one he designed right after our overturn.  He thinks we should find more ways to integrate it.  Like paint the symbol on our armor or hang the flag in more places.  He has also suggested festivities to spread the joy of our colours... the details of which were lost to me."

  ###ENCLAVE WAR FOCI###

  mnc_sisters_believe_in_fair_play:0 "Bleeding Hearts"
  mnc_sisters_believe_in_fair_play_desc:0 "§PHead In The Cloud's§! Log \n\nAs we progress, the Enclave nears.  Though the threat is not yet immenent, the Sisters have begun to worry.  I'd seen and fought the Enclave back in Chicago.  They take until there's nothing left.  There is no time to spare idling."
  mnc_a_peaceful_resolution:0 "Among the Roses"
  mnc_a_peaceful_resolution_desc:0 "§PHead In The Cloud's§! Log \n\nThis is all beyond my wildest dreams.  I wonder what Patrocolus would think if he saw us now-- standing side by side with an enemy we came to know through a nightmare.  I had promised my Sisters I would see them through this land.  Our dream, once a fickle seed, has flourished like a rose from the vine.  And we still have so much more to do."


  ###THE SISTERS STRONGHOLD -- CAN BE A NEW NAME, TOO, BY THE WAY! WE CAN RENAME CITIES ON THE MAP

  mnc_children_wargoal:0 "The Silo On The Hill"
  mnc_children_wargoal_desc:0 "From our intel, the Church of the Silo are a cult that holds radioactive relics relics.  Though, unlike Havre, they are not as welcoming to our ideals of peace.  Loose ends don't last in the wastelands.  If the people there are to survive, they need order."

  mnc_cannibalism_ban:0 "Hungry For...?"
  mnc_cannibalism_ban_desc:0 "Despite our prior warnings, some folk have not been taking our 'no cannibalism' law seriously... With the Obelisk Chantry up, now can't be a better time to enact tighter restrictions."

  mnc_macarthur_ruins:0 "No One Wins In Scorched Fields"
  mnc_macarthur_ruins_desc:0 "§PHead In The Cloud's§! Log \n\nI was naive to think this would end any other way.  But as we failed to reach for the moon, we fell upon a star.  MacArthur's Air Force Base makes perfect for a mountain stronghold -- resilliant against the elements and all threats.  We'll repurpose it straight away."

  mnc_reaver_scientists:0 "Revears In New Coats"
  mnc_reaver_scientists_desc:0 "With our expanding influence, the Reavers have approached us with another material request.  Our success has them dreaming bigger--let us fulfill these wishes."

  mnc_military_development:0 "To Train A Sister"
  mnc_military_development_desc:0 "We've amassed more recruits and volunteers than we can count. Paladin Minerva and Paladin Johanna have requested to help guide these recruits and volunteers through their homestead duties."

  mnc_assess_the_economy:0 "Rising Skylines"
  mnc_assess_the_economy_desc:0 "As our territory grows, abandoned and ruined buildings come in abundance.  A Sister would not be without their craftiness. We can strip these older buildings for resources and built something better."

  mnc_dedicated_homeliners:0 "Artisan Hammers"
  mnc_dedicated_homeliners_desc:0 "Scribe Augustine, of the few scribes devoted to the Sisters since before the rebellion, has shown interest in bolstering our defenses using artisan techniques.  He's requested resources for an extensive study.  "It came to me in a dream," he told us.  "I see a strong defense line, crafted with artisan perfection."  Well, he hasn't failed us before."

  mnc_training_the_young:0 "For A Better Future"
  mnc_training_the_young_desc:0 "Knight Thrift has gathered a small team of researchers and weaponsmiths.  They've proposed a project to advance our melee weaponry.  \n\n"If it doesn't work, we'll certainly learn from it," Thrift remarked.  "But if it does... Say, Honour, how do you feel about an explosive sword?""

  mnc_tribal_initations:0 "Lessons From Buried Traditions"
  mnc_tribal_initations_desc:0 "The adaptability of our Sisters have skyrockted since we've relinquished the stigma against cultural practice.  Most of our new recruits lack a tribal background, so why not pass on these skills and traditions to them?"

  mnc_washington_invasion:0 "The Queen in the North"
  mnc_washington_invasion_desc:0 "With the Enclave gone, Honour sets her sights on the further reaches of Montana and Washington.  Behind her the Sisters rally.  Whatever lies ahead, we face them united."

  mnc_temple_of_the_old_gods:0 "The Obelisk Chantry"
  mnc_temple_of_the_old_gods_desc:0 "A chantry that sanctions practice of all cultures and general social events has been a popular idea among the Sisters.  With our worries of the Enclave laid to rest, we can begin construction of the Obelisk Chantry!"

  mnc_embrace_traditions_over_codex:0 "Scribes Of New Ink"
  mnc_embrace_traditions_over_codex_desc:0 "We've recruited new scribes from our influx of civillians.  Many are interested in following our ways of the world.  Bless them that their ambition has never been graced by the stifling laws of the Brotherhood.  Let's prepare resources to help these future scholars' endeavours."

  mnc_civilian_developments:0 "We Are Nothing, If Not With Eachother"
  mnc_civilian_developments_desc:0 "Most of the civilians we've absorbed do not understand the ways and beliefs of the Sisterhood.  Our exemplary Sisters can amend that; we'll send our most influential down to town squares.  Then, will the people know what we fight for."

  mnc_mending_the_tears:0 "Mending Sorrows"
  mnc_mending_the_tears_desc:0 "So easily do we forget who suffers most from war and brutal skirmishes.  Morale among our workers have waned by the recent tolls of our expansion.  Let us do what we can to uplift their spirits and motivation."

  mnc_open_caravansary:0 "The Sisterhood Caravans"
  mnc_open_caravansary_desc:0 "Bands of merchants all around are contacting us with trading deals. They're interested in some of our older tech we've left to gather dust in the warehouse for caps.  Who are we to deny them? The caps are swell and the deal is clean."

  mnc_horrors_of_nordikon:0 "Whispers Of The Sister Gods"
  mnc_horrors_of_nordikon_desc:0 "Our scouts have spotted disturbing activity festering from Nordicon.  "A nightmare in the making," Paladin Lucius noted, "Like the Calculator.  Heh, or maybe something more".  We must strike first, lest this nightmare walks into reality."

  mnc_legacy_of_terror:0 "Immortal, Undying, Damnation"
  mnc_legacy_of_terror_desc:0 "§PHead In The Cloud's§! Log \n\nHe called himself The Immortal.  I remembered him from the time before the title, but... what had he become? What horrors did he bring to the coasts? He was responsible for Hayman-- an unbearable fate encased in steel. In the name of all this 'Washington Brotherhood' has terrorized, we erase this monster's legacy. \n\nMay a new generation never need to know of such a name..."

  mnc_a_cause_worth_fighting_for:0 "A Cause Worth Fighting For"
  mnc_a_cause_worth_fighting_for_desc:0 "We've brushed lightly with The Cause and their fight against The Immortal is honourable.  We can spare our resources for their endeavours-- no doubt the Immortal caused great ruin to the region."

  #sisters - minerva/minerva's arena (MAKE A COOL NAME I BEG YOU)

  mnc_theclouddrinker:0 "Minerva, The Arena's Bewitcher"
  mnc_theclouddrinker_desc:0 "The opening of Minerva's Arena has left many skeptical.  Despite the poor wording choices in her proposal, Minerva claims it's all for good sport; "This is a special sort of training that really gets the blood pumping.  Nobody's dying under my watch!  Nobody with a lick of common sense and a fighting spirit, that is.""

  mnc_sistersofsteel:0 "Someone Bring The Stretcher!"
  mnc_sistersofsteel_desc:0 "Per Minerva's word, her Arena has cultivated emboldened hearts rather than catasprohe as many speculated.  Thrilled with its success, Minerva has put in a request for certain resources, promising a new level of special forces by the end of the month... We're still unsure where 'fireworks' plays into this, but Thrift would be more than overjoyed to deliver."

  mnc_thebattleswehavewon:0 "And The Crowd Goes Wild"
  mnc_thebattleswehavewon_desc:0 "§PHead In The Cloud's§! Log \n\nThe lonesome raider I met all those years back has reclaimed her life.  Free from her binding past, she has risen a star; the Arena's Bewitcher.  Minerva has become an idol to our Knights-- enrapturing all with her showmanship-candor.  She'd do well as a Field Marshall.  Her fiery soul brings the best out of all of us."

  #sisters - rightmost branch

  mnc_funnythingsinthebunker:0 "Working Without Honour"
  mnc_funnythingsinthebunker_desc:0 "While Sentinel Honour takes the Sisterhood to new horizons, she has appointed Paladin Johanna, Knight Thrift, and Knight Warwick to improve smaller areas of the homestead.  The three have settled on two improvements long overdue; entertainment and renaissance."

  mnc_theatrics:0 "The Auditions Begin"
  mnc_theatrics_desc:0 "Paladin Johanna has expressed great interest in introducing 'theater' to the Sisterhood-- a form of entertainment she had learned about from the bunker.  Her request to hold auditions have been met with mixed reactions; some puzzled, others have humored her, and a few have shown genuine interest in participating.  Whatever the case, the ordeal is boosting morale, so why not?"

  mnc_musical_theatre:0 "Bringing The Broadway Home"
  mnc_musical_theatre_desc:0 "By everyone's surprise, the auditions went smoothly.  Paladin Johanna is ready to take her chosen actors into the 'rehearsal' stage.  We've cleared out a storage house for her stage and have provided the resources for her 'props'.  Whispers of excitement have spread through the Chapter-- everyone has their eyes on this Broadway. Let's ensure Johanna succeeds."

  mnc_proper_maintenance_requests:0 "Hitting The Books"
  mnc_proper_maintenance_requests_desc:0 "With most of the Scribes gone, Knight Warwick plans to look into alternatives to bolster our research efforts.  He has located an abandoned library in the more dangerous reaches of the land.  It would be worth the risk to send an expedition to the library and see what we can find. "

  mnc_improving_qol:0 "Squashing Book Worms"
  mnc_improving_qol_desc:0 "Knight Warwick and his group have found the library full of intact texts.  Even the building itself remains mostly unscathed despite the elements.  We could refurbish the library for ourselves or strip the valuable materials for other needs... but first, we'll need to take care of the infestation."

  mnc_clearingspace:0 "A Thrift Approach To Minor Inconveniences"
  mnc_clearingspace_desc:0 ""Now, rock-garbage and debris-- that's a tough crowd, right?  And nobody wants to be the guy who has to manually lift and carry all of those sad rocks away.  So let's save our guys the back pain and think smarter-- think blastier." \n\nSentinel Honour was informed that, despite everyone's best attempts to stop Thrift from throwing unauthorized explosive around, the Knight already had a ticking bomb in his hand, and nobody was willing to take it away."

  mnc_trust_in_brotherhood:0 "New Floor Maps? Pass It Over!"
  mnc_trust_in_brotherhood_desc:0 "Knight Thrift has single-handedly cleared the land for construction faster than any of us in the past.  Despite this, Sentinel Honour has forbade him from stepping foot on any construction site until the work is over.  Let us get straight to constructing new facilities before Knight Thrift inevitbly breaks that restriction."

  mnc_its_always_a_good_time:0 "Trust In The Sisterhood" #Change the benefits to represent Johanna, Thrift, and Warwick's endeavours instead of just the Thrift path?
  mnc_its_always_a_good_time_desc:0 "Johanna's, Thrift's, and Warwick's operations have all been major successes in their own right.  The Sisterhood is reaching a turning point of enlightenment, industry, and knowledge-- let's continue forward!"

  #################################################################################################THIS IS ALL NOT TO BE WORRIED ABOUT

  mnc_slave_labor: "Taxation, Not Tyranny"
  mnc_slave_labor_desc: "Many people in Montana have served as leeches to their neighbours. Taking these people and putting them to work will be a mutually beneficial agreement, whether they recognize it or not."

  mnc_poweringthefalls:0 "Exploiting Fort Verity"
  mnc_poweringthefalls_desc:0 "Despite local interference with our operations, we can maybe make some mutually progressive developments-- improving quality of life for our men and the nearby civilians, at the very least, enough to make them back off and save our ammunition."

  mnc_powerlinerepairs:0 "Powerline Repairs"
  mnc_powerlinerepairs_desc:0 "We can send out Knights to work on setting up and maintaining the old powerlines in and around Fort Verity. While we won't have much of a hold on energy yet, it'll undoubtedly improve any powered infrastructure."

  mnc_power:0 "Kicking the Switch"
  mnc_power_desc:0 "There are numerous forms of hydroelectric power just waiting to be utilized on the rivers here. Tapping into those will strengthen our hold on not just power but water as well."

  mnc_approachthecyborgs:0 "Approaching the Metal Mouths"
  mnc_approachthecyborgs_desc:0 "A group of neurotic techno-fetishist raiders known as the 'Metalmouths' are in this region. Securing what we can of their 'cybernetics' would be ideal."

  mnc_theendofusefulness:0 "The Metalmouths, De-Metaled"
  mnc_theendofusefulness_desc:0 "Such frivolous usage of technology was irresponsible. It was only inevitable they fell in our presence. Now, salvaging what we can from what remains of these fools is all that's left."

  mnc_industrialpush:0 "Industrial Moves"
  mnc_industrialpush_desc:0 "The key to our success on this mission is keeping a consistent production and maintaining our repairs. Sending Warwick and his knights to figure out the nearby workshops will be able to help get a jump on a proper, functioning industrial side."

  mnc_advancedcomponents:0 "Advanced Salvaging"
  mnc_advancedcomponents_desc:0 "There's several old terminals and subsytems in the area that we can tear apart for what's inside to help with our own repairs and manufacturing-- if we're going to stay for awhile, we may as well get comfortable."

  mnc_industry_civilian:0 "Reestablishing a Work Program"
  mnc_industry_civilian_desc:0 "We have all the power, all the techno-scraps, and all the empty facilities we could need at the moment. With our stranglehold on Fort Verity further solidified, we can set the Knights to work."

  mnc_propertytaxes:0 "Imposing Property Taxes"
  mnc_propertytaxes_desc:0 "The locals here are sitting on troves of old-world relics and caps. If we're to integrate with the region better and allocate our resources effectively, we'll need to purloin some amount of the locals belongings."

  mnc_puttingthemtowork:0 "Putting The Locals To Work"
  mnc_puttingthemtowork_desc:0 "Many of the people here are scavengers. No doubt many of them would be better suited helping us produce our equipment."

  mnc_righteouslaw:0 "Rigid Measures"
  mnc_righteouslaw_desc:0 "Since arriving here in Montana, we have faced several accounts of disorder on behalf of the locals. It's time to banish the demons and institute a proper sense of order into these people. Establishing a proper policing force, an 'Overwatch,' will help aid in peacekeeping endeavors."

  mnc_nationalguardstockpiles:0 "Mendoza's Casket"
  mnc_nationalguardstockpiles_desc:0 "Mendoza's Casket is a bit of a local legend-- an old police station that was co-opted by the National Guard and made into a treasure trove of an armory. Though its said whatever is inside is legendary, it is, of course, guarded by centuries old security systems and booby traps. Sending a team in will take some time, and may incur some losses, but could pay off..."

  mnc_handhtools:0 "Appraising The Old H&H Factory"
  mnc_handhtools_desc:0 "There's a rather large H&H Tools factory within town-- if we were to renovate it and place some of our newfound work force within, we'd be able to increase production by a significant amount."

  mnc_enclavemachinery_desc:0 "Unlike the ones we find in a typical wasteland romparound, the machines in employ of the Enclave were fairly well-kept. With a simple repaint job and Scribe or two to reprogram them, we can recommission them as official Brotherhood auxillaries."

  mnc_loyalty:0 "The Chains That Bind"
  mnc_loyalty_desc:0 "§MPatrocolus'§! Log \n\nIn the end, all that holds the Brotherhood together are the Chains That Bind. To subvert or oppose them is to call our entire livelihoods into question. The Sisterhood and the rest of their ilk gave me every warning possible and I still tried to help them. Never again."

  mnc_stakingoutthebunker:0 "Glorious Purpose"
  mnc_stakingoutthebunker_desc:0 "Johanna's fate was sealed and a minor form of order had been restored to Fort Verity thanks to the Brotherhood's newfound control. With its previous inhabitants removed from the premises, and threats all around, it was time to start thinking bigger than just bunkers."

  mnc_thelowestlevel:0 "One Way... Or Another"
  mnc_thelowestlevel_desc:0 "The list of things to check off was growing by the day. Numbers to replace the Sisters, weapons to upgrade trooper efficiency, a nearby airfield in need of clearing-- one way, or another, Montana would need to be freed of its inadequacies."

  mnc_carrots_on_sticks:0 "Holding Carrots on Sticks"
  mnc_carrots_on_sticks_desc:0 "Though many were already deceased or gone with the wind, the Sisters were still operating in some capacity. Dealing with them in the coming days would require a totalitarian's precision."

If we want to get this junk out of the armory with its pieces altogether, setting up a workshop inside the armory-- and gettin' actual power flowing in-- will speed things up a helluva lot faster than bringing out small batches and crying over repairs. Know what I mean?" --Knight Thrift"

  mnc_project_stargazer_industrial_throws:0 "Old Schematics"
  mnc_project_stargazer_industrial_throws_desc:0 "The Scribes managed to locate a terminal with several old-world schematics for various unfinished buildings in the region. We'll take them and finish the job, except this time it'll be for the Brotherhood, and not a flagellating mess of a country."

  mnc_project_stargazer_water_desc:0 "Thrift, with some of the Sisters that stayed behind with us, has set up some forges to try and help create new pieces for the rifles we've accrued. Allowing him to have his water that he needs will allow them to cool the forges as necessary."

  mnc_project_stargazer_circuitry_desc:0 "There's several old terminals scattered in the bunker and in the town nearby. If we tear them apart, it's likely we can take some of their wiring and circuits and apply them to our own weaponss. If what Scribe Amity tells me is correct, that is."

  mnc_project_stargazer_energy_throws_desc:0 "§MPatrocolus§!' Log \n\nThe strangest thing happened today. Thrift had a sneaking suspicion about a ticking sound he kept insisting he could hear out in the woods, and then when I finally let him go investigate, he opened a colossal 5x5 pit of plasma mines. While we have a whole team set on disarming them, which is always a... Well, hardly a good thing, my hope is that we can take them apart and use it to help STARGAZER."

  mnc_project_stargazer_composite_desc:0 "§MPatrocolus§!' Log \n\nI'd say I'm getting tired of all these little requests, but then I remember that I don't actually have to help them find them, even though I always end up being on the search team.

While maybe not Enclave-ready, we can conscript them into our ranks and have them serve as auxillaries to our forces. If anything, to serve as shields and allow us to keep our armor in better condition."

  mnc_noproblemtoogreat:0 "No Problem is Too Great"
  mnc_noproblemtoogreat_desc:0 "§MPatrocolus§!' Log \n\nThe Enclave's presence here in Montana has sent a chilling sense of urgency into the heart and mind of every Paladin and Knight under myself.

  mnc_establishanoutpost:0 "Fear Is The Most Valuable Sense"
  mnc_establishanoutpost_desc:0 "It didn't even need to be ordered for the Paladins to begin setting up fortifications and FOBs surrounding the bunker.

  mnc_kickingoutthescrappers:0 "Kicking Out Scrappers"
  mnc_kickingoutthescrappers_desc:0 "There are several scrapper and scavenger groups making their home in some burnt out buildings in the area. Any action on our end causes them to scatter, causing as much chaos as they can-- including, at times, shooting at our own. They have to be removed before we endure any proper conflicts."

  mnc_patrocolus_consortium_goal:0 "No Room For Selfishness"
  mnc_patrocolus_consortium_goal_desc:0 "The nearby imbeciles within the Coal Consortium believe that they have no need to give us what they have. Clearly, they've never been face-to-face with the threat of the Enclave-- and so they cannot be taken seriously. Commandeering their supply by force is the only option."

  mnc_patrocolus_havre_goal:0 "Closing the Gap"
  mnc_patrocolus_havre_goal_desc:0 "I don't care who or what stands in my way-- we're going to make sure we reach this Enclave before they reach us. I want to see them run deeper into their mountains as they realize who exactly came knocking on their door."

  mnc_replenish_the_host_desc:0 "The journey to Montana has been... Excruciating, to say the least. Many of our men would like a bit of time to have some fun before we pursue any further endeavors. While unprofessional, I don't see the harm in allowing them to recharge."

  mnc_approach_the_raiders_desc:0 ""Raiders are chem-addicted idiots that are usually too swilled up on booze to tell left from right, but the ones that have made it this far typically have some kind of moronic creed to follow.

  mnc_farmhand_ideas:0 "Farmhand Training"

  mnc_exaltations_idea:0 "Mass Recruitment Drives"
  mnc_exaltations_idea_desc:0 "With our higher echelons restored, let's get started on getting a proper sortee back in action. If the Midwest expects to see us again, we better have something to show for it other than flashy explosions and gimmicky rifling techniques."

 mnc_triumph_in_montana_fucking_stupid_line_arrrgh_desc:0 "When we arrived in Montana, I was tired. I thought everything around me was crumbling and that the folks back in the Midwest wanted me gone. When we started the long walk this way, and when my thoughts were not on airships and survival, I resented my colleagues. \n\nAlong the way, however, Honour, before she passed, imparted with me something I'll never forget: "Make sure your life does not become your sickness." I think a lot about those words, even with where we are now. It doesn't matter why I'm here, or any of us, really. It only matters what we do with what we've been given."

  mnc_airplanemoves1_desc:0 "For the first time in around 200 years, a plane took off from Odhran Air Force Base. Even under our occupation, eyes were lit up all along the streets of Fort Verity as Knight Isaiah took flight. When he was prodded for thoughts after the landing, he had this to say: "Jesus fuck man, did you see that? The Fucking sky man. God fucking dam, look at my hands right now, literally shaking. Who were those brothers who flew? The Left-bros or something? Wonder if they ever imagined something this bad-fuckin-ass. Like a fucking dove. Uh oh, is this- this on holotape?

  mnc_veteranteachers_desc:0 "Some of the scribes that have engaged with the flight simulators have picked up on some great tips and tricks for anyone wanting to try and hop into any form of aircraft-- let's ensure that people know who to go to for this, before we end up with too much more malpractice and irresponsibility."

  nf_mnc.1.t:0 "Patrocolus' Charge"
  nf_mnc.1.d:0 "Long ago, in the American Midwest, a set of Midwestern Scribes and Paladins were running a search operation within their hundredth or so derelict facility. Just as they thought they had seen it all, they found something remarkable: a map to a pre-war bunker that pointed to what had once been known as the state of Montana. The supply log was simple but powerful, and to some, mythological: the bunker was designed to hold its own weight in Fusion Cores, Plasma Rifles, and other associated supplies. \n\nThe weight of such an expedition was considered for a time, but deemed fruitless. This bunker had surely been plundered, some said: others, that it was simply too far to send a recovery detachment and expect realistic, worthwhile results. With the threat of the Enclave in Chicago, and the threads that held the Brotherhood together already strained, it was deemed unworthwhile. \n\nThat is, until one certain Paladin decided to steal the notes, the cipher, and several other pieces of confidential Brotherhood data, eloping by her lonesome into the long night north. An expedition was mustered nearly overnight, the embarrassment and anger of the higher echelons like a risible thunder through the ranks. To them, in such a state of emergency, there was only one man fit to send. "Go Patrocolus, go forth and scour this traitor, and secure this vault for the Brotherhood," they told him. \n\nAnd so, he set off. What did he prioritize in the expedition's forces?"
  nf_mnc.1.a:0 "He prioritized experience over numbers."
  nf_mnc.1.b:0 "Experience was important, but numbers would outlast veterancy."

  nf_mnc.2.t:0 "The Sisters of Steel"
  nf_mnc.2.d:0 "Among Patrocolus' ranks was a peculiar group, the ‘Sisters of Steel,' controversial in their formation and moreso with their inclusion in the expedition. Composed almost entirely of ex-Tribals, Reaver descendants, and reformed Raiders, the Sisters were a group formed entirely around the concept of camaraderie over codex-- something that has gotten them into considerable trouble in the past. \n\nWhen Patrocolus chose to include them, he did so out of a mixture of pity and mannered respect. The rogue Paladin who had stolen the confidential materials was a Sister herself, after all. While his colleagues expressed pushback at the thought, he held faith in the idea that they had a chance to redeem themselves under his charge, and restore their position in the Brotherhood. \n\nTheir leader, Sentinel Honour, has long-since been a disputed figure under the Midwestern hegemony. Some claim that even with her years of training under the Brotherhood, she retains a fiery independence unlike those of her status-- causing those loyal to her to be fiercely so, and her detractors to be even louder..."
  nf_mnc.2.a:0 "Sisters Stand Strong."

  nf_mnc.3.t:0 "By the Fireside, Out on the Frontier"
  nf_mnc.3.d:0 "Down the hill from Honour's perch-of-choice was a party of friends and family. Cries of cheer and valorous boasts emanated like a roundabout clockwork, as they did at every celebration. Even still, as she watched the campfires flicker and the Knights drink deeply of their canteens, she couldn't have felt more lonely. Before she could sink deeper into her thoughts, she heard the aged boot of Patrocolus stamp down next to her. \n\n"Sitting up here alone?" he chuckled, "You know, we're a week or so out from the bunker, Honour— why not come celebrate?" asked Patrocolus. \n\nHonour snickered softly. "As fun as that sounds, my mind remains on the Johanna situation... I can't fathom her reasoning." \n\nPatrocolus sighed, understanding but dismissive. "I'll do you one better: it doesn't matter. She ran off with some of our most valuable knowledge without so much as a word in her stead. As far as I'm concerned, if she cared at all, she'd have said something." he rested his hands on his hips, "I know what you're thinking, but she knew what would happen." \n\n"I know her better than you, Patrocolus," Honour said gently, "She's not a traitor. She's family, to you and to me." \n\n"Then I suppose someone should have told her that before this all happened," Patrocolus shrugged his shoulders, "In any case, I'll have some of the others save you some rations. We don't know what to expect deeper in Montana." he dusted himself off, glancing back to her. "Family, Honour, is the folks who stayed with you the whole way, no matter what." \n\nHonour glanced up with with a semi-stern gaze, rich with a valorous intent. "I agree," she said, knowing they meant two different things..."

  nf_mnc.4.d:0 "The elder had called for Warwick and Hayman to give him an in-person report on their recent ventures: keeping tabs had become an important part of the post-sisterhood Expedition, after all. Patrocolus looked up from his papers as they entered, removing his reading glasses. "How are you two liking the new initiates?" \n\nHayman cut Warwick off in a flash. "I'm glad you asked." she pulled out a laser pistol, aiming it directly at Patrocolus' head and firing. A near perfect 45 degree miss— the laser leaving a black mark on the bunker wall. \n\nAfter a fumble, the Elder snarled back. "Watch where you point that damn thing, Hayman!" Patrocolus spat. \n\nShe rolled her eyes beneath her helmet. "You knew damn well it wasn't going to hit you." she said dismissively. \n\nWarwick withheld a comment, instead answering as normal as he could. "So, that bad? How new are they?" \n\n"Two weeks into training. Their hands were too fidgety. Bastard couldn't keep them straight long enough to hold the refractor in place, so now it's a dud until I fix it myself." \n\nWarwick rubbed his face, "Let me guess: you were standing right next to them while they did it?" \n\n"So I was." \n\n"I think we just figured out why they were freaked out," Warwick raised a brow, half-frowning. "You realize there's no good reason to watch them like a hawk, right?" \n\n"Hm," Hayman grunted, inspecting the laser pistol idly. "How about working under pressure?""

  nf_mnc.101.a:0 "...We'll see about that."

  nf_mnc.102.t:0 "Maybe This Was A Mistake..."
  nf_mnc.102.d:0 "Patrocolus often liked to go on long walks outside the bunker, admiring the scenery and finding calm places to simply think on things without the humdrum of lights and busy bustling of knights. Johanna, especially, preoccupied his time-- and Honour's lot. Though he knew he did right by the Codex, and by the Brotherhood, he couldn't help but think on her words extensively, as if her face alone was haunting him. Realizing he was too left alone with his thoughts, he returned to the bunker-- \n\nAnd found the worst mess he had ever seen. The leftovers of a ‘mini-volcano' were strewn about the floor, a small plasma coil had exploded, blowing out a pipe, and somehow Scribe Carmella had been rendered unconscious-- to which, no one had an explanation. Before he could express his anger, a bit of volcanic foam fell on his head, a frothy mess dripping down... And though an expression of terror was on everyone's face, all he could do was laugh and give them a "Be careful next time.""

My old gang—the Ashmen—used to do this every morn'.  Added some bark to our bite, and it was easy to spot one of our own in big fights."  She smacked her hands together.

He scanned the water-stained pages.  It's something on lakes—not his specialty, but hey, it could be someone else's.

Nothing like I've seen before" \n\n"So they're everywhere?"  Betsy chimeed with a dry chuckle.  "Here I was hoping that was a problem exclusive to my quarter." \n\n"Just know I hand picked each one of you for this expedition.

"I'd rather know if this is a threat now than find out later. \n\nThe rest of his Knights glanced at one another, reluctant to move.  Sighing, Warwick shoved his bag into Penn's arms and took a step forward. \n\nThe husk was malformed like a misshapen bean, or a stiff sack of flour.  Strange calcified bark stretched along the surface of the husk.  A few giant worms nibbled at its base— suckling on a strange, sap-like substance that oozed from the abrasions.  Though, there was something else peculiar; scorched books and torn papers were gathered in a pile of ash.  A campfire?  But whose? \n\n"WATCH YOUR HEAD!" \n\nAt Betsy's shout, Warwick snapped his gun up and fired.  The bolt struck the leaping shadow in the shoulder, sending it tumbling to the ground beside the husk.  The Knights were quick to surround the attacker, only to find a small, scraggly figure in a Chinese Stealth Suit. \n\n"A child?"  Warwick murmured, lifting his finger off the trigger. The child scrambled to the husk, hugging it tightly in a fit of quiet sobs.  The Knights turned to Warwick for his call, their weapons still raised. \n\nWarwick clenched his jaw, but his mind was set.""

"Paladin Johanna, for your violations against the Chains That Bind, we shall grant you mercy from disgrace.  A swift death will do you well." \n\nJohanna knelt before the Elder. Her posture was stiff, bracing for the supposed inevitable.  She raised her hands slowly to take off her helm.

Patrocolus was an idiot to buy into your bluff, and an even greater one to have brought you along." \n\nPaladin Hayman was unrelenting, as were her Knights.  All of whom were not Patrocolus'.  They dawned a skewed version of the Midwestern armour--almost like a mockery of our own.  The plating was crooked and rusted, as if sealed in place with hasty craftsmanship.

"Oh, Honour's here." \n\n"Yeah, thanks for the look-out," Johanna grumbled flatly, chucking a half-finished brooch at her brother.  The brooch fell short half way across the room. \n\nHonour approached the workbench.  "What's all this?"  She smiled, picking up a flower from the table. \n\n"Uh— just a little passion project.  Originally they were for the new recruits and volunteers to boost morale, but then I got carried away."  Johanna blinked, slightly flustered as she awkwardly pushed four brooches towards Honour.  "Ah, I couldn't decide what brooch would suit you more so I made a few." \n\n"My," Honour beamed at the brooches.  "Well... I think I already have a favourite.""

  nf_mnc.700.t:0 "Steady She Goes"
  nf_mnc.700.d:0 "Patrocolus rallied his platoon outside.  They dragged Johanna from the bunker and threw her to the ground.  The Brotherhood formed a circle around the rogue Paladin to keep out any unwanted intervention.  To one side of Patrocolus was Sentinel Honour, on the other was Knight Warwick. \n\n"Loyalty is a fragile thing," Patrocolus began.  "Paladin Johanna, for your violations against the Chains That Bind, we shall grant you mercy from disgrace.  A swift death will do you well." \n\nJohanna knelt before the Elder. Her posture was stiff, bracing for the supposed inevitable.  She raised her hands slowly to take off her helm.  Like her armor, her face sported patches of dust and grime. \n\nWarwick faltered at the sight of his sister's face.  "Elder, I—" \n\n"Will speak not a word," Patrocolus snapped.  He could not blame Warwick; witnessing family die was never easy, but there was no time for second thoughts—a violation was a violation.  He shot his hand up, glancing at Paladin Hayman with a nod..."
  nf_mnc.700.a:0 "..."

  nf_mnc.701.t:0 "Alas, Poor Johanna"
  nf_mnc.701.d:0 "Hayman clicked her gun to Honour's temple. "And don't you think about it," she sneered. \n\nHonour dropped her gun. Minerva raised hers in response, shouting a word of command, but to her surprise and risible concern, only a fraction of the Sisters took a stance. \n\n"Did you really think I wasn't going to find out about this?"  Patrocolus sighed, "Betraying me at an execution for treason. Surely, you see the irony, Sentinel?" \n\n"There is no irony in unjust murder."  Honour glared back. \n\nPatrocolus' brow darkened. He balled his fist, but all he could do was stare back at her, glowering. She couldn't be acting more childish about the situation. \n\nHayman scoffed. "If that's how you feel, then maybe we can make it room for two." \n\n"No," Patrocolus said sternly, leaning towards Honour. "First. How many more of you are there?" \n\n"More than you had ever cared to know," Honour spat back. Even now, she acted as though she was immune to the world. \n\nHayman glanced back to Patrocolus. He nodded back. "Get on with it." Hayman shouted. And, like that, Paladin Johanna was no more."
  nf_mnc.701.a:0 "Dark things were on the horizon."

  nf_mnc.702.t:0 "Chains That Bind"
  nf_mnc.702.d:0 "Patrocolus found Warwick sat outside the bunker, watching orange-laden violets dance around the sunset by his lonesome. Approaching, he crossed his arms in a friendly manner, trying to share the view. "Knight Warwick," he nodded as their eyes met, "What's on your mind?" Patrocolus asked, glancing down at the Knight. "It's not like you to be so sullen." \n\nThe knight was silent for several lasting moments. Taking a deep breath, he turned to look the Elder in full. "I just thought it'd be easier, you know?" \n\nPatrocolus narrowed his eyes. "What do you mean?" \n\nWarwick's gaze fell, and his tone grew hushed. "I don't blame you for not knowing. We didn't talk much." he drew a long, wistful sigh. "She was my sister— Johanna, I mean. I had months to think about it on the way here, and it still... Well, it still wasn't easy." Warwick mumbled, taking a long sip of his canteen \n\n"It was your duty.  It had to be done," Patrocolus said, sighing.  "Valna, I know, would have understood.""

  nf_mnc.711.d:0 ""Do you know what the last thing my mother said to me before she died?  Take care of Johanna'."  Warwick glanced at Patrocolus expectantly \n\nThough he stood as tall and valiant as ever, Patrocolus felt that same knot in his stomach. "It doesn't get easier."  \n\n"What?"  \n\n"Living with it." Patrocolus bit his cheek, glancing off into the night. Patrocolus sighed, rubbing his own neck for a moment. "It just doesn't get any easier, Warwick. Eventually, you just become numb to it, and it becomes a part of who you are." he patted Warwick's shoulder. "When I was a boy, I saw my father, a negligent do-nothing raider, executed by a Brotherhood soldier. I lie, of course, and tell people I was born into this whole thing— but I wasn't." he rolled his tongue with a thoughtful click, "I still see it when I shut my eyes. Not every wound will heal, Warwick... And that's okay." he said, sitting up and walking off— leaving the Knight alone with the stars."
  nf_mnc.711.a:0 "Take Note, Then, Of Your Chains, Brothers..."

  nf_mnc.703.t:0 "Patrocolus' Thoughts"
  nf_mnc.703.d:0 "The mission in Montana was complete. The bunker had been secured, the traitor Johanna was no more, and now, the Sisters were extinguished— or, at the very least, on their last legs. Yet, the longer I have remained with my detachment in Montana, I've heard more and more disturbing things from the locals: a King of Roaches to the east, a nuclear silo occupied by heathenous cultists, scant rumors and legends of an Enclave splinter in the mountains... The list went on and on. \n\nIf even half of these rumors are true, then that means the tranquility of Montana doesn't have long for this world. These people have little to no means of defending themselves against such domineering threats. Of course, naturally, securing the land should be paramount, though I know it not to be an overnight experience. The schisms and pains we have experienced thus far are too many to count and so we must adapt to our new environment. \n\nMy assessment, as is, is quite simple:"
  nf_mnc.703.a:0 "It was time for a new 'Glorious Purpose.'"

  nf_mnc.704.t:0 "What Was Left Behind"
  nf_mnc.704.d:0 "Patrocolus nursed a bottle of whiskey as he stared at the mural, his heart shrinking with every lingering gaze. He wasn't sure when the townsfolk had made it; whether it was before or after the expedition arrived. Taking another swig, he stared directly at her once more. Though it pained him to admit it, they most certainly nailed the biting hope in Johanna's eyes. \n\n"Are you happy?" Honour would ask if she were here, and he would answer "No. I'm not." Her comments, while snappy, were poignant. She was his biggest critic, in the end, but she helped him see what he couldn't. Now that she was gone, well... He had himself. \n\nPatrocolus followed the code. He did exactly as he was told, as he had all his life. Johanna had betrayed that same code, and yet her memory was immortalised.  Not by her crimes, but by vibrant colours and painted flowers... \n\nPatrocolus couldn't help but wonder what he'd leave behind when died—what would his legacy be, if anything?  "Whiskey's a tricky thing," he then thought with a dry smile. \n\n"Elder," Hayman's voice called from behind, "Are you doing okay?" \n\nPatrocolus sighed, frustrated that he had allowed Hayman to sneak up on him. "Yes. I'm quite alright," he said, shovelling the near-empty whiskey bottle out of sight. "What do you need, Hayman?" \n\n"Just checking up on you, Elder. You've been here quite awhile." \n\nPatrocolus cocked a half-grin at that, his hollow chest filled even if only halfway. Sometimes, all you could count on in the world was loyalty. Hayman was still with him, and maybe that's all he needed.  "I've just been thinking on what to do with this mural." \n\nHayman nodded, crossing her arms at the artwork.  "I say tear it down.  The less martyrs the better." \n\nPatrocolus sighed, glancing at the mural once more..."
  nf_mnc.704.a:0 "No, we keep it.  Let her memory rest peacefully."
  nf_mnc.704.b:0 "You're right.  We can't have any more rebel-fodder."

  nf_mnc.705.t:0 "Appropriate Incentive"
  nf_mnc.705.d:0 "Hayman and Patrocolus walked side-by-side through the bunker halls, both of their brows stern. The Sisterhood's betrayal had turned a lot of heads down, and even more to the side. \n\n"We can't ignore it, Patrocolus," Hayman slapped her hand down on the Elder's shoulder, "They need to be dealt with." \n\n"I know." Patrocolus said flatly. "I was a fool to even bring them along." \n\nHayman shrugged, "We tried to warn you."  \n\n"I know," Patrocolus bit the inside of his cheek, crossing his arms. "and I'm not making this mistake again." he said, pulling out a piece of paper and scribbling an errant message upon it. Stamping it with the Brotherhood sigil, he practically threw it at Hayman. "Take this little carrot on a stick I've thrown together. Have the scribes print as many as possible and hang them around outside and inside the bunker." \n\nHayman glanced at the paper— a bounty had been opened for every self-proclaimed ‘Sister of Steel.' Smirking, she looked back to Patrocolus. "Ad Victoriam, Elder." \n\n"Ad Victoriam." Patrocolus repeated back, watching with an empty gaze as Hayman exited the room."
  nf_mnc.705.a:0 "Ad Victoriam."

  nf_mnc.706.t:0 "The Greatest American Evil"
  nf_mnc.706.d:0 "The Elder's gaze whipped up as Hayman entered the chamber, her already-heavy stomps doubled from their usual fury. She stormed up to the desk, slamming down something that Patrocolus thought they had left behind in Chicago. \n\nIt was an Enclave soldier's helmet. Judging by the plasma burns on its side, it was recently scarred— no doubt by Brotherhood personnel. With narrowed eyes he looked to Hayman. The Paladin nodded back. \n\nPatrocolus sighed quietly. Placing his hands on his temple, he stared back into the cracked lenses of the dead man's helm as though it were a demon manifested: a monster who he thought only existed in his nightmares. "How many?" \n\n"We don't know yet." Hayman lolled his tongue around the inside of his mouth, her face locked into a sneer. "All we know is this one came from the mountains." \n\nPatrocolus glanced between Hayman's tired visage and the helmet. "We'll need to be ready." \n\n"Understood, Elder." Hayman saluted. "What are your orders?" \n\n"Send it west." he demanded, jamming his finger into the helmet's lens. "Find a courier, and send it west. I want them to know we're on our way." \n\nHayman half-smirked. "Ad Victoriam, Elder." she said, taking the helmet and exiting."
  nf_mnc.706.a:0 "May We Know No Fear."

  nf_mnc.707.t:0 "Looking Over A Shoulder"
  nf_mnc.707.d:0 "Minerva had grown a recluse since the Sisterhood break-off.  But she kept to herself-- never any bite to back up her bark.  It was only on a matter of when, Patrocolus wondered, that she would snap.  So at the edge of dawn, where per miraculous luck would Minerva find him alone, she drew her gun on him.  And Patrocolus, who was none surprised, instantaneously snapped his own gun up in response. \n\n"Don't make me a murderer, Minerva." Patrocolus quietly demanded, his finger gently pressed against the trigger of his rifle. \n\n"Make you a murderer?" she scoffed, "Tell that to Johanna." \n\n"You know that's not fair. Don't forget, we were here to deal with her." \n\n"To deal with her?"  Her eye twitched with a maddened craze.  "You old bastard!  I saw it when we got there, you saw it when we got there.  She saved these people! She helped them get a better life—" \n\nHayman fired first. \n\nPatrocolus watched as Minerva fell backwards, a perfect, burnt-out hole in her forehead releasing black smoke. The smell of burnt skin was in the air. \n\n"Finally, some silence," Hayman said, lighting a cigar as she rounded the corner to reveal herself fully. \n\n"Don't speak ill of the dead," Patrocolus glanced over to Hayman.  \n\nHayman shrugged.  "We were all thinking it." \n\nPatrocolus sighed, inspecting Minerva's corpse with a tut."
  nf_mnc.707.a:0 ""At least that's the last of our loose ends.""

  nf_mnc.710.t:0 "Steel Reigns in Montana"
  nf_mnc.710.d:0 "In the span of a few hours, MacArthur Air Force Base was infiltrated by Brotherhood forces and detonated from within by an I.E.D. designed by none other than Knight Thrift. For better or for worse, the few survivors and regional stragglers now answered to the Brotherhood's authority. \n\nElder Patrocolus, who was present at the aftermath, had this to say when prompted for a statement: "MacArthur was a den of devils that got exactly what it deserved. As for our own, I couldn't be prouder of what we have achieved. (...) It is in service of Steel and guardianship of one's Brothers that each man finds his purpose. My friends, stand with your Brothers. Guard them, guide them. And in each of them find purpose."

  nf_mnc.800.d:0 "As Patrocolus and his expedition mustered themselves for the long road ahead, Paladin Johanna continued her own, forging a path to Montana with the ciphers and map close to her person at all times. \n\nThrough what her wit could not break, her power armored fist did. She forded rivers by riding across scrapped floats, traveled with caravans through desolate woods, and even helped a young yao guai out of a tree on the way to Montana. \n\nWhen she arrived to the bunker, Fort Verity, she was surprised to see it wasn't vacated like reports said.

"How long have you all been set up here?" \n\n"Why don't you lower your weapons first, then we talk?" \n\nThere was a twitch in the armoured woman's shoulders.

Despite their claims of 'peace', Patrocolus knew the Enclave could only be here for one reason - the nuclear bombs.
