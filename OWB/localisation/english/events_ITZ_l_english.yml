  itz_harvest.1.t:0 "The Day of Q'an"
  itz_harvest.1.d:0 "It seems just a blink of an eye since the last day of Q'an, but another year has passed, and so the time to reap what we have sown is here one again. Up and down the Empire, peasants are toiling in the fields to bring in this year's crop before it spoils, and our administrators expect we will get our cut of the crop before the week is out so that we can feed our armies and cities."
  itz_harvest.1.a:0 "Time to sow the winter seeds..."
  itz_harvest.2.t:0 "Army Desertions"
  itz_harvest.2.d:0 "Following the rather less than perfect day of Q'an we have experienced this year, many of our reservists have abandoned their army groups so that they can return and help their families avoid a devastating famine. Unfortunately, there seems to be little we can do to stem this huge wave of desertions other than change our official recruitment policy to reflect the desertions. Over the coming months we can undoubtably attempt to recruit them again."
  itz_harvest.2.a:0 "Damned peasants!"

  nf_itz.1.t:0 "Red, White and Blue"
  nf_itz.1.d:0 "The Americans were once our ally. Then they become our rival. Then, our enemy. In 2051, the American Army invaded Mexico, with the intent of securing our oil and protecting their businesses. Whilst the Mexican forces put up a stiff resistance, they were ultimately dashed by the superior quality and quantity of the American troops. The American troops were then free to occupy the entirety of Mexico. When the American troops came down to the Yucatan peninsula, our militias initially resisted, but the American came back with an overwhelming force. The result? Well..."

  nf_itz.2.t:0 "The Ways of Old"
  nf_itz.2.d:0 "Whilst nuclear hellfire, the subsequent collapse of civilisation stripped and the following decades of blundering ignorance stripped the new world of most of its knowledge of the old, some scraps of old world values have been clung to. These values, often conveyed through folk stories, have become important to the growing middle- and upper-class groups in the Empire, who seek any link to the old world they can. Two popular stories are passed around most, and with our help one could become paramount in our society. Which should it be?"
  nf_itz.2.a:0 "A story about the sanctity of the family"
  nf_itz.2.b:0 "The tale of the infallibility of a ruler"
  nf_itz.3.t:0 "The Fleet"
  nf_itz.3.d:0 "Long a part of Itzan history, the great Gulf Fleet that the Itzan Empire can field in times of war is something of legend. Drawn up from merchant boats, as well as regular military craft, our fleet rules the Western Gulf pretty much supreme. Opinions divide, however, about how we should best employ this unique advantage. One young admiral, Almirante Camila, argues we should focus our naval prowess on contesting the rivers of Mexico. Almirante Mateo, meanwhile, is a firm believer in wide patrol formations, helping protect trade and enhance our reputation. Finally, the elder Almirante Luis backs a force in being approach, supporting the use of large ships to project our superiority far and wide. Which plan does the Kalomte favour most?"
  nf_itz.3.a:0 "Opt for Almirante Camila's plan."
  nf_itz.3.b:0 "Approve Almirante Mateo's plan!"
  nf_itz.3.c:0 "Almirante Luis' plan seems best..."
  nf_itz.4.t:0 "A Kalomte Arises"
  nf_itz.4.d:0 "On the 12th of March, 2232, the Kalomte Sebastián II first made his name. There, on the banks of the Papaloapan River, the young Sebastián rallied the last remnants of the Itzan army to him, holding off wave after wave of Aztlan infantry. The Itzan force, barely a fraction of the Aztlan hoard, that day forced the Aztlan to a bloody stalemate and, following the collapse of the Aztlan's northern excursion into Tlaloc's lands, ultimately forces an Aztlan retreat. It was on that day the Kalomte became revered amongst the Ejército, and amongst the people. \n\nNot but a few years later, Sebastián seized power almost bloodlessly in a coup. With the support of almost the entire armed forces, he proclaimed himself the Kalomte, or king of kings. All who met him agreed he had one quality that made him a great king, but what was it?"
  nf_itz.4.a:0 "His tactics and split-second choices left many in awe!"
  nf_itz.4.b:0 "His charisma, for it was enough to rally the flagging troops."
  nf_itz.4.c:0 "His keen focus on supply left a lasting impression."
  nf_itz.5.t:0 "The Two Fronts"
  nf_itz.5.d:0 "Following his victory on the banks of the Papaloapan river, Sebastian became a popular hero. The Ejército followed him devotedly, and the militias bowed before his might. Three years after his victory against the Aztlan, in 2242, Sebastian seized power in a coup d’état – the takeover was executed without so much as a whisper from society. Sebastian was crowned Kalomte – King of Kings – by the priests of the temples. \n\nAfter taking power, Sebastian set about destroying army corruption and, most importantly, recovering territory lost to the Itza in the 40 years prior. His campaigns rolled back the Aztlan Empire, expelled southern raiders into the deepest jungles alongside the militias in Honduras, and destroyed the northern tribes. Now, in the year 2275, the Kalomte is about to embark on new expeditions – but where should be prioritised?"
  nf_itz.5.a:0 "Securing the west is critical!"
  nf_itz.5.b:0 "The threats to the north are the most grave."
  nf_itz.6.t:0 "Northern Reconnaissance Mission"
  nf_itz.6.d:0 "After the conquest of the northern tribes, the northern frontier went more or less quiet. However, reports of unusual sightings have recently started coming in to Steel City – reports that come flooding in ever more frequently by the week. We should send an elite detachment of the Ejército to investigate what lies past the northern border – and put down any threat there might be."
  nf_itz.6.a:0 "We wish them well."
  nf_itz.7.t:0 "Visitors from the Itza"
  nf_itz.7.d:0 "The Itza – the large, Mayan tribe to our south, has sent a well organised and equipped armed party into the territory around our complexes. They appear to be a small scouting party at best, and the weapons they sport barely deserve the name, but regardless we must decide what to do with them. They're staying close to their settlements, so leaving them be would be unlikely to expose any of our facilities to them. Alternately, we could employ misdirection and fear to drive them away – or we could straight up annihilate them."
  nf_itz.7.a:0 "Stay out of sight, and let them go where they wish."
  nf_itz.7.b:0 "Confuse them."
  nf_itz.7.c:0 "Send them packing back to their settlements!"
  nf_itz.8.t:0 "The North is Abandoned"
  nf_itz.8.d:0 "The 5th Recon Ejército has returned from its expedition north, and appears to have found nothing to explain the bizarre occurrences our northern settlements have reported. However, they have recovered a variety of weapons by an unknown manufacturer – possibly showing that someone, or something, has been lurking to the north. Whatever it is, however, we do not know."
  nf_itz.8.a:0 "We'll keep a wary eye north..."
  nf_itz.9.t:0 "Chasing Ghosts"
  nf_itz.9.d:0 "The 5th Recon Ejército has returned from its expedition north, telling tales of ghostly shapes harassing them during the day and strange sounds following them at night. However, the group couldn't find a cause for the strange occurrences, and after several days of hunting returned to Steel City. The only sign of life the recon group recovered is a handful of weapons by an unknown manufacturer – why they are laying about to the north of our settlements, we don't know."
  nf_itz.9.a:0 "Spooky..."
  nf_itz.10.t:0 "The Last Stand of 5th Company"
  nf_itz.10.d:0 "Dreadful news from Steel City today – contact has been lost with the 5th Recon Ejército. The last transmission we received from them was at 22:13 last night – a panicky, short transmission in which the radioman of the recon group informed us the group was under overwhelming attack by an unknown force, armed with high–tech weapons. The radioman informed us most of the group had already been killed, and so the rest of the group was making a last stand to try and recover the bodies of the fallen. Death or Glory. \n\nWe have had no further contact from the group since, so they are presumed massacred. We shall mourn them."
  nf_itz.10.a:0 "Horrific!"
  nf_itz.11.t:0 "A Test of the Man"
  nf_itz.11.d:0 "Sunlight beat down on the courtyards. In it, two figures were locked in combat – circling, thrusting, reposting, waiting for their chance to strike. One of them, the shorter of the two, was the shrewd fox Tobias Rey, the current ruler of Tzotzil. The other, one of Rey's generals, one Maximo Vela, a great hulk of a man. The stakes for their fight could not be higher, for stake was the very future of Tzotzil itself. Then, as the day stuck noon..."
  nf_itz.11.a:0 "A well–planned thrust from Rey knocked Vela down!"
  nf_itz.11.b:0 "A flurry of blows from Vela knocked Rey's guard aside..."
  nf_itz.110.t:0 "Vela Victorious"
  nf_itz.110.d:0 "Earlier today, at our instruction, Maximo Vela challenged [TDT.GetName]'s ruler Tobias Rey to a duel for leadership. These duels are traditional to decide on the leadership of Tzotzil, and are seen as an honourable way to settle disputes, but have been rarely used over the past decades due to Rey's fearsome reputation inside the arena. However, at the prompting of the Kalomte himself, Vela decided to try for the title in the arena. Sure enough, Vela's brute force was able to beat Rey's cunning, and Vela has now been crowned the ruler of Tzotzil. Soon, he shall swear fealty to the Kalomte himself!"
  nf_itz.110.a:0 "Good news"
  nf_itz.111.t:0 "Rey Survives Another Day"

These duels are traditional to decide on the leadership of Tzotzil, and are seen as an honourable way to settle disputes, but have been rarely used over the past decades due to Rey's fearsome reputation inside the arena. However, at the prompting of the Kalomte himself, Vela decided to try for the title in the arena. Despite his best efforts, Vela was unable to break Rey's careful defence, and ultimately a well-planned thrust from Rey knocked Vela to the floor. Unfortunately, this completely sinks our plans to peacefully annex Tzotzil, but we do have other methods at our disposal..."

  nf_itz.12.t:0 "Raiding the Army of Mexico"
  nf_itz.12.d:0 "The Army of Mexico lies to our north, occupying much of the coastline as well as the Soto la Marina river. Their large water frontage makes them very easy to raid – the Army of Mexico simply can't cover all the shorefront. As a result, we should conduct a large–scale raid on their shoreline, stealing what we can. What target shall we focus on?"
  nf_itz.12.a:0 "Their weapon storage facilities!"
  nf_itz.12.b:0 "Their military factories."
  nf_itz.12.c:0 "Their schematic storages..."
  nf_itz.13.t:0 "Raiders from the South"
  nf_itz.13.d:0 "Late last night, a large fleet entered sight on the shoreline. Slowly and silently the fleet crept forwards, until from the centre of it five landing craft emerged. Swiftly these crafts landed on the shore, and out of them spilled highly trained marines of the Chichen Itzan Merodeadores. They swiftly overwhelmed the small local militia, as well as the garrison of the nearby military instalments. The marines grabbed everything they could, and burnt down the rest, before slipping back into their craft and leaving with the navy that brought them. Cowards."
  nf_itz.13.a:0 "We must rebuild!"
  nf_itz.14.t:0 "Raiders Return from the North"
  nf_itz.14.d:0 "The northern raid was a resounding success. Our brave Merodeadores, after an escort from the Gulf Fleet, made landfall on the Army of Mexico's completely unguarded coastline. The rapidly overwhelmed the small local militia, before crushing the garrison of our target – a reasonably large industrial complex. Once inside, our troops grabbed what they could and burned down the rest, before returning to the landing craft and leaving as smoothly as they came."
  nf_itz.14.a:0 "A resounding success!"

  nf_itz_border.1.d:0 "Our recent border clashes with the Aztlan have been a success, and the actions of our units has caused the Aztlan to flee the field of battle. As a result, we have captured a sizable swathe of territory. Now we just need to ready ourselves for a counterattack."
  nf_itz_border.1.a:0 "Wonderful!"
  nf_itz_border.2.t:0 "Failure at the Aztlan Border"
  nf_itz_border.2.d:0 "Our recent clash with the Aztlan has concluded, and we have been beaten back from the border. What a resounding failure! We must prepare ourselves for a counterattack, and be glad that the Aztlan decided not to advance over our border to press home their advantage."
  nf_itz_border.2.a:0 "Regroup, quickly!"
  nf_itz_border.3.t:0 "Indecisive Clashes at the Aztlan Border"
  nf_itz_border.3.d:0 "Our recent clashes with the Aztlan have ground down to a stalemate – neither side has been capable of creating or pressing home an advantage. As a result, both sides have decided to slacken off the fighting somewhat. Whilst there's no conflict now, that doesn't mean one won't emerge again soon."
  nf_itz_border.3.a:0 "We gave it our best."
  nf_itz_border.4.t:0 "Success at the Itzan Border"
  nf_itz_border.4.d:0 "After a surprise attack by the Itzan forces, our brave troops have successfully repelled all the attackers. The Itzan forces melted like paper before our superior quality troops, and they should thank their Gods that we didn't press home our advantage."
  nf_itz_border.4.a:0 "Wonderful."
  nf_itz_border.5.t:0 "Shattered Retreat from the Itzan Border"
  nf_itz_border.5.d:0 "The Itzan forces, helped by surprise and the cover of night, have succeeded in routing our border forces. The Itzan forces have advanced somewhat, seizing numerous strategic strongpoints and high ground, making it very difficult for us to push liberate the land."
  nf_itz_border.5.a:0 "Regroup, quickly!"
  nf_itz_border.6.t:0 "Indecisive Clashes at the Itzan Border"
  nf_itz_border.6.d:0 "Our recent clashes with the Itzan forces have ground to a stalemate – neither side has been capable of creating or pressing home an advantage. As a result, both sides have decided to call of the conflict – though it may break out anew at any moment."

 # Kalomte hurt
  nf_itz.15.t:0 "Catastrophe"
  nf_itz.15.d:0 "The Kalomte has been injured. Badly. At the moment, details are sparse – all we know is that the Kalomte was hit at medium range whilst inspecting troops on the northern border at dusk. The bullet appears to have entered his spine and punctured a lung – the Kalomte swiftly fell unconscious but is clinging to life for the moment. His dreams were surely shattered by a bullet in the dark. Rulers come and rulers go, but will our kingdom fall apart?"
  nf_itz.15.a:0 "Dark times are ahead..."
  nf_itz.16.t:0 "Things Start Falling Apart" # aka 'Shit Hits the Fan'
  nf_itz.16.d:0 "Just over a week has now passed since the Kalomte's attempted assassination. We still do not know the identity of the attackers, nor do we know when or even if the Kalomte will recover. One thing is becoming clear, however – how much the country relied on his central authority to just keep running. The Kalomte left no clear successor to his rule, and local governors have used the chaos to exercise more and more autonomy from the orders issued at the capital. Over our borders, vultures are also circling. The Aztlan are eagerly eying up our borders, and to the north the frequency of the odd occurrences 5th Recon Group tried to identify is increasing drastically. At home, the situation is just as bad – orders are going unfollowed, the army is falling apart and the citizens are lining the streets. Things are getting bad."
  nf_itz.16.a:0 "Can it get any worse?"
  nf_itz.17.t:0 "Chaos to the South"
  nf_itz.17.d:0 "The leader of the Chichen Itza, the Kalomte Sebastian, has been critically wounded whilst inspecting Itza troops on our border. Whilst the attack wasn't orchestrated by us, it gives us a wonderful opportunity to launch an attack to seize Steel City from the Itza. The Itzan army weakened by the lack of their glorious leader, and society is in turmoil until a successor can be found to the Kalomte – when this happens, we will have lost our window of attack."
  nf_itz.17.a:0 "Steel City is almost ours!"
  nf_itz.18.t:0 "Tzotzil Declares Independence"
  nf_itz.18.d:0 "Seizing on our current political paralysis, the already semi–autonomous [TDT.GetName] has declared independence from our rule. Disgusted by our leadership struggles, and denouncing our apparent disregard for the 'people', the elders of Tzotzil have placed Tobias Rey back on the throne to steer the country through the current rough troubles. Reports, though unconfirmed, seem to even indicate that our garrisons in the region have been disarmed!"

  nf_itz_border.7.d:0 "Grave news from the north – large numbers of troops from an unknown foe are massing on our border, seemingly intent on seizing Steel City from our rightful rule. We must not let them! Whilst our troops are suffering from disorganisation, they will surely rally to defend the city. Surely?"
  nf_itz_border.7.a:0 "Things could get dicey..."
  nf_itz_border.8.t:0 "Petro Chico Repelled"
  nf_itz_border.8.d:0 "Glorious victory is ours! The forces of the remnants of the Petro Chico corp have been repelled from Steel City, in a stunning victory that will be remembered for all of time. Sure enough, our brave troops rallied – Ejército and Merodeadores alike – behind the Itzan flag. The routed Petro Chicans left numerous advanced technologies which will doubtlessly be of great use to our scientific endeavours."
  nf_itz_border.8.a:0 "An everlasting victory!"
  nf_itz_border.9.t:0 "The Loss of Steel City"
  nf_itz_border.9.d:0 "Steel City has been lost – swamped under waves of soldiers from the remnants of the Petro Chico corp. The city has been invaluable to our economy – serving enough raw materials to service a large portion of our war effort. Unfortunately, the defeat seems to have come largely an outright refusal from the Merodeadores and Ejército to work together – as a result both forces fought bravely to defend the city, but were ultimately outflanked one by one."
  nf_itz_border.9.a:0 "If their cola wasn't so good we'd be extremely pissed right now."
  nf_itz_border.10.t:0 "Inconclusive Results on the Northern Front"
  nf_itz_border.10.d:0 "Our clash with the remnants of the Petro Chico corp has been inconclusive – whilst we have repulsed them from Steel City, the city has suffered incalculable damage from the days of intense fighting that went on. Whilst the Merodeadores and Ejército initially struggle to cooperate to defend the city, the two found common purpose when the military district began coming under intense shelling, and together repulsed the enemy attack. Whilst this isn't a conclusive victory, we probably won't see the Petro Chico banner bearing down on Steel City for a while yet."

The city will be invaluable to our economy – serving enough raw materials to service a large portion of our war effort.

  nf_itz_border.12.t:0 "Defeat Outside Steel City"
  nf_itz_border.12.d:0 "Our forces have been repelled from Steel City after days of stubborn resistance – a shocking defeat. Both the Ejército and the Merodeadores, the two armed services of the Itza, put aside their differences and rallied behind the Itzan flag – a possibility we hadn't foreseen when beginning the attack. In the chaos of the route, we left behind numerous weapons that the Itzan troops have eagerly stolen – undoubtably we'll see them fielded against us sooner or later."

Whilst the Merodeadores and Ejército, the Itza's two armed forces, initially struggle to cooperate to defend the city, the two found common purpose when the military district began coming under intense shelling, and together repulsed our attack on the area.

  nf_itz.19.d:0 "The country is falling apart, and the Kalomte is not here to save us this time. However, two people seem to be too busy to dwell on this – the Halach Uinik, Carlos Franco, and the Ti'huun, Clara Guzmán. Instead, they are making moves behind closed doors – counting their allies and negotiating for support amongst the rest – for the stakes have never been higher. The Council of the Elders has been called together, at the request of the Ti'huun, to decide on a successor to the Kalomte. \n\nThe Council is expected to choose Clara as the next leader of the Itza – indeed, she was confident enough to call for the Council. However, the Halach Uinik and grand Generalissimo of the Ejército, Carlos Franco, is determined to not go down without a fight – for Clara's victory would almost certainly spell the end of the Ejército as they exist now. The next few months will not be uneventful..."

As a result, he has been named Regent and Heir–Apparent to the Kalomte, and has been further gifted extensive emergency powers to attempt to bring the country back to order.

The news spread like wildfire through the court and then the city, for the Kalomte has recovered from his seeming fatal injury.

Whilst it is somewhat credible that a large raider band could launch such a raid due to the chaos following the Kalomte's injury, it seems very unlikely they'd fight so well in the face of substantial casualties. Therefore, we have suspicions that units of the Merodeadores were involved in the raid, and by extension we believe Clara was directly involved. It seems she is very keen on taking us down..."

In her latest attempt at gaining the later, Clara has rather loudly declared that she has directed a multitude of researchers in the Empire to try and find a cure for the Kalomte's injury and illness. This has obviously gone down well with the Elders, who vastly prefer the Kalomte over either Carlos or Clara, and will go down even better if she succeeds.

On more than one occasion, a battle that should have been an easy win turned into a lengthy slog thanks to the arrival of Honduran mercenaries. Therefore, it might be worth enforcing our political dominance over them to ensure their fighters never work for enemy hands. Alternately, we could attempt to enter a military alliance with [GRH.GetName], ensuring they can continue to fend off raiders without the Aztlan, or any other player, getting involved."

However, Tlaloc is no more. Years of infighting within his subroutines has finally killed the personality we once respected, and replaced it with three far worse foes. One of them, styling himself Moctezuma after the Aztec emperor of old, seems hell bent on restoring the Aztec empire his historical double once held. The robot seems to care not who he must kill to achieve his goals, and Aztlan and Itzan alike have fallen fowl of his robot hordes.

Whilst Clara has made it abundantly clear she’s not after a marriage of love, or not with a man at least, even she couldn’t pass on the opportunity a marriage with Rafael would bring – namely, an alliance with their once grave enemy.
