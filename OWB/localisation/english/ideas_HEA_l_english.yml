  hea_steam_powered_weapons_desc:0 "In the old world along the Northwest commune there was a great deal of investment put into a ingenious creation known as the Steam Core.\nOriginally, it was put forward by the Northwest Commonwealth during the old war during the prototyping stages of the AER project as a potential candidate, it was rejected in favour of designs using MF cells. Despite this, the economics of the region had become too reliant on the rejected fission core (aptly known as steam cores) design, and thus development of the weapons fueled on steam cores continued.\nThese steam cores give all of our equipment a powerful kickback in the strength they give out, yet also come with certain rare failure incidents."
