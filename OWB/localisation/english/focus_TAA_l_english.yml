The same barons that had been causing such a huge fuss over the RRG's new regulations have decided that they'd be better off free than paying taxes, and that they wanted the Howitzers to call the shots. \n\n Now, one of the most important rules of business is such: If the waters are calm, don't rock the boat. So naturally, the notion of bombing their neighbors just to get around a few regulations they could bribe their way out anyway of seemed like something of a poor reaction. It didn't much matter now, if the RRG was allowed to come back across the river it'd dismantle the whole system from top to bottom, so Todd now longer had a choice in the matter; the Militias were raised, barricades built, and plans were drawn for the coming war."

Guerra treated any of our criticisms like treason, claiming on one hand that they were an existential threat, and on the other nothing more than a band of raiders!

Further, Guerra pointed out, if the rumours to the south were true, there might be more opportunities down Mexico Way in the near future... opportunities which would require access to Rio's territory.

It was far too early to go out for dinner, but much too late to go somewhere that serves breakfast; with considerations in mind he took a short walk down the road to a local Brahmin burger joint. The food was maybe a little pricey but well prepared, if not a little overcooked; it left Todd slightly tired, but well fed."

With that in mind he went to the cafeteria that served moderately overpriced organic food to the noveau riche. As he ate into the brahmin avocado salad, he reflected that Rosado had really brought the nation a long way."
