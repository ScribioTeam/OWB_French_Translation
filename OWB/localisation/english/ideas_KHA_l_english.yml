  KHA_idea_lowlifes_and_vagabonds_desc:0 "We lord over a large amount of territory that just isn't part of the Great Khans. As a result, we struggle to draw recruits from these areas normally. Maybe we should change tactics, and focus on recruiting those vulnerable to 'persuasion'..."

  KHA_idea_legion_trade_desc:0 "Despite rising tensions throughout the Mojave surrounding the Legion, their presence has not been detrimental to us in the slightest: far from it.
