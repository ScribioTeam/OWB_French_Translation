  aerodynamics_tech:0 "Aerodynamics"
  aerodynamics_tech_desc:0 "Not present on dev test"
  aerodynamics_tech_1:0 "Motorized Flight"
  aerodynamics_tech_1_desc:0 "While gliders and catapults are serviceable, we will need to reach beyond and into powered flights again. The most likely avenue of development is to use already existing chemical engines in a reinforced biplane design, as well as the addition of hydraulically powered controls such as tail and wing fins. Opening up the way to self-powered aerial assets is crucial for us to maintain control of the sky."
  aerodynamics_tech_2:0 "Lightweight Metals"
  aerodynamics_tech_2_desc:0 "Until now, materials used in the construction of our planes were mostly wood and textiles, but as a need for more tonnage capacity and stiffer construction begins, this will not be enough. What is needed is a light alloy both sturdy and cheap, able to withstand high-G manoeuvers. Experiments with alloy smelting should provide us with such a material, and let us go one step further into conquering the airspace."
  aerodynamics_tech_3:0 "Engine Advancements"
  aerodynamics_tech_3_desc:0 "Chemical engines designed for ground vehicles need torque and reliability, which is good, but certainly not for a fighter craft. The rate of sortie of aircrafts as well as the short operation time allows us to concentrate on performances above all. Such a design process gives our aircrafts incredible speed and agility to deal with enemy threats in record time."
  aerodynamics_tech_4:0 "Jet-engines"
  aerodynamics_tech_4_desc:0 "Consisting of a compression system passing air into a series of centrifugal devices, which is then super heated in a gas turbine core and formed through a mobile directional nozzle, those engines allow a considerable increase in all flight characteristics. This let place to the first generation of manufacctured, jet-powered aircrafts the wasteland has ever seen."
  aerodynamics_tech_5:0 "Advanced Power Systems"
  aerodynamics_tech_5_desc:0 "Atomic technology allows hotter propulsion jets, increasing thrust exponentially, by replacing the previous system with a more direct one. Air is simply run through a reacting nuclear core, heating it at temperatures beyond even 2000 celsius, and then redirected to a reinforced alloy nozzle. Such a direct system lacks both fuel and complicated parts, simplifying our designs."
  aerodynamics_tech_6:0 "Adaptive Compartmentalisation"
  aerodynamics_tech_6_desc:0 "A deep understanding of the internal layout of our crafts let us design specially-made alloy firewall and armor platings, meant to compartmentalize their important sub-sections. Doing so will protect our aerial assets against lucky blows, as shrapnel and bullets will simply be caught between armor layers and kept from doing catastrophic damage to multiple sub-systems."
  aerodynamics_tech_7:0 "Fortress Protocol"
  aerodynamics_tech_7_desc:0 "Fortress Protocol is the name given to the emergency damage control procedure enacted in desperate cases on our blimps. Absolutely every non-essential personel is assigned to either damage control teams, having been drilled for months on each possible scenarion and it's solution, or fire support teams, trained to provide covering fire for our blimps with rocket launchers and other ordonnance."

  fighter_engine_tech:0 "Fuel Injection"
  fighter_engine_tech_desc:0 "The primary difference between carburetors and fuel injection is that fuel injection atomizes the fuel through a small nozzle under high pressure, while a carburetor relies on suction created by intake air accelerated through a Venturi tube to draw the fuel into the airstream. This leads to a notable difference in engine performance under extreme manouvers, alowing for more flexibility with these."
  cas_defence_tech:0 "Defensive Armament"
  cas_defence_tech_desc:0 "Going further into our CAS self-defense doctrine, our engineers have moved defensive guns in a bulletproof high-visibility turret, armed with incendiary ammo as well as a mechanical gun laying devices, able to protect a wider area."
  cas_offence_tech:0 "Offensive Armament"
  cas_offence_tech_desc:0 "For the purpose of a full ground-attack focus, hatches in the belly of our aircrafts as well as the tail were installed, and a flexible mounting will let our gun crew switch their weaponry from defensive duties to offensive ones. As our aircrafts fly above, they can now fire a hail of bullets on ground troops."
  strat_internal_tech:0 "Internal Bomb Mounts"
  strat_internal_tech_desc:0 "Focusing more on internal bomb bays than external pylon mounts allows us to have an increased bomb load that's protected from the elements, and not creating additional drag on the airframe. Such measures will increase our strategical range by reducing fuel consumption and allowing slightly more agility."
  strat_external_tech:0 "External Bomb Mounts"
  strat_external_tech_desc:0 "Reinforcing wing pylons to allows for bomb packs of two or even three ordonnance on one pylon will, in addition to the standard internal bomb bay, increase our payload capacity considerably. This can be used either for more devastating strikes or for longer strategical destruction sorties."
  air_drop_tank_tech:0 "Drop Tanks"
  air_drop_tank_tech_desc:0 "External, cheap, and aerodynamic fuel tank meant to be dropped once entering battle, or once empty, let our aircrafts carry additional fuel for long range mission without compromising agility, or tactical payload."
  air_refuling_tech:0 "Aerial Refuling"
  air_refuling_tech_desc:0 "Specialized flight programs coordinating with internal flight computers on multiple aircrafts is required for accurate refueling techniques, but beyond that problem it is a very valuable thing. Having flying fuel tanks refueling our aircrafts in the air will increase their range and let them strike deeper into enemy territory, regardless of terrestrial infrastructure."
  air_armor_tech:0 "Flying Armour"
  air_armor_tech_desc:0 "Applying armoring techniques, generally reserved more for naval vessels than aircrafts, to our blimps will let them benefit from better defenses. The huge carry capacity of those aerial leviathan let them be have plating as thick as those of a tank. Supplemented by spall liners and personal crew equipment, it lets our zeppelin take even more damage before being shot down."

  inert_blimp_tech:0 "Inert Lifting Gas"
  inert_blimp_tech_desc:0 "Using inert lifting gas into our research for lighter-than-air designs is a sure thing, as those type of gas are not flammable and are well known in both civilian and military application. The level of knowledge already present, combined with the innate resistance to enemy fire, will make our dirigible less likely to burst into flames."
  flamable_blimp_tech:0 "Lightweight Lifting Gas"
  flamable_blimp_tech_desc:0 "Focusing our attention toward lightweight gas, compressible to much higher pressure and thus being able to fill balloons at a higher density than other types of gas, will let them have better lift. In practical term, it means an increased strategical range, which let us strike the enemy deeper into their territory or patrol farther away from our supply network."

  glider_tech:0 "Glider"
  glider_tech_desc:0 "As our troops encounter more and more obstacles, it might be worth looking to unconventional solutions. The sky is a hard limit for most wastelanders, which already have trouble finding water or food, much less vehicles. Our engineers have, after multiple stressful tests, invented a military glider able to strike from the sky, bypassing enemy defenses. Launched from a railed catapult system installed on a scrap truck, those unpowered gliders give our troops some aerial support. Armed with two sub-machineguns, a complement of grenades for ground strikes, and a lot of prayers, our pilots can now support frontline troops and strike behind enemy lines. The mobile catapult system installed on a truck bed also gives our gliders a considerably increased range, as the trucks have more autonomy than them, even though they still are dependant on fixed supply bases."
  fighter_tech_1:0 "Biplane Fighter"
  fighter_tech_1_desc:0 "Powered flight becomes a possibility again, now that our technology is developping, letting us build upon the earlier foundations to begin a truly modern army. The materials available currently are weak and heavy, a good structural bracing with lightweight design is essential. Biplanes provide this design, as well as extremely good agility. Powered by a chemical truck engine and armed with two water-cooled machineguns linked to a synchronized gear, it lets us tear into soft target while having better speed and not needing dedicated launch plateforms. Specialized hand-dropped explosive shells instead of simple frag grenades also improves the damage we can do against lightly armored targets and structures. Our supply structures evolve in consequences, and become actual aerodromes."
  fighter_tech_2:0 "Monoplane Fighter"
  fighter_tech_2_desc:0 "With the advent of lightweight metal capable of supporting more weight, our biplane design becomes outdated. Speed and low drag is primordial, so a monoplane design is now preferable. Increased weight capacity allows the installation of a third, higher caliber machinegun for gun runs, switching to air cooling for our weaponry, as well as external struts able to support two 50kg high explosive bombs. Specially designed chemical engines for aeronautical purposes allows much higher top speed and better efficiency, giving us the possibility for increased strike range, better sortie rate and interception techniques against enemy crafts."
  fighter_tech_3:0 "Jetfighter"
  fighter_tech_3_desc:0 "Designing our fighters around an experimental jet engine instead of trying to fit said engine in an existing design allows maximum usage of every bit of power available while improving most, if not all flight characteristics. Incorporating pilot feedback from previous sorties as well as considering their demands will let us improve upon our engineering beyond what simple theory could give us. Internal bomb bays with provisions for 250kg bombs as well as fuselage-integrated, high-caliber, electrically-fired machineguns let us shred enemy fighters. It is essential to concentrate on higher rate of fire instead of firepower for our interceptors, as the window of opportunity on interception attemps get smaller and smaller because of the increased speed in engagements. Air-to-air multipurpose rockets on external wing-tip pylons finalises our improvements."
  fighter_tech_4:0 "Nuclear Jetfighter"
  fighter_tech_4_desc:0 "A nuclear, stabilized core instead of our more standard chemical engines let us lighten our fighters, as we can remove fuel tanks and switch them for more ammunition or avionics. The inclusion of nose radars, rotary autocannons and guided infrared air-to-air missiles massively increases our interception capabilities, letting us destroy anything but the most advanced enemy fighter in a single pass. A mixed ammunition belt, external bomb pylons and integrated ground scanner also increases our ground support ability. Our fighters are the most advanced in the entirety of the wasteland, and we dominate the airspace. No one is safe, be it enemy fighters or ground troops. Our missiles will clear the sky and our light thermobaric bombs will cleanse the battlefield."

  cas_bomber_tech_1:0 "Triplane Attacker"
  cas_bomber_tech_1_desc:0 "Triplanes, compared to biplanes, increases the carry capacity of our air assets. Integrating such a wing arrangement in our airforce allows the manufacturing of specialized ground attack planes. A single high caliber machinegun, combined with an under-fuselage pylon for one 250kg high explosive bombs, let us make devastating combined gun and bombing runs on defenseless enemy troops. A rear-facing machinegun position, armed with a single water-cooled gun, let our triplanes defend themselves against aerial threats, or provide more firepower during gun runs."
  cas_bomber_tech_2:0 "Monoplane Attacker"
  cas_bomber_tech_2_desc:0 "Switching to a more resistant all-metal design, and providing light armoring in the form of a bulletproof glass cockpit and thin plating in the front facing arc let our CAS support carry on their duty under AA fire. To increase their firepower against ground threats, an internal bomb bay for four 50kg bombs against light targets and two external pylons for 250kg bombs against heavier targets let them be more polyvalent. An internal arragement of four medium machineguns as well as a rear heavy machinegun increases our defensive capabilities against other aerial assets, and provide precision gun runs to our foot soldiers."
  cas_bomber_tech_3:0 "Jet-Attackplane"
  cas_bomber_tech_3_desc:0 "While other planes would try to incorporate armaments to their base designs, our newest attack plane does better. By first designing a heavy rotary autocannon, then building a low-drag fuselage around it and using it as base, it lets us carry heavy firepower in the form of a single central 25mm rotary autocannon, firing high explosive shells as well as armor piercing ammunition against armored targets. Wing pylons with the ability to mount either 500kg bombs or even rockets let us annihilate targets in the open and damage even hardened structures such as bunkers or outposts. The final touch is two jet engines, one on each side of the aircraft, specifically customized for low-altitude and low-speed performance, letting our attack planes destroy enemy ground assets in unexpected attacks that leaves their anti-air defenses confused and entire formations gutted."
  cas_bomber_tech_4:0 "Nuclear Powered Attackplane"
  cas_bomber_tech_4_desc:0 "Increased tonnage capacity from a high-performance nuclear engine allows our engineers to go all-in for their designs. With the rotary autocannon increased to a baffling 35mm caliber, pylons reinforced to fire guided missiles, an under-fuselage mount to carry a massive 750kg cluster bomb or bunker buster missile and direct radio communication with troops on the ground, our ground attack planes strike fear in any enemy. Be it entire companies destroyed in one pass in a massive explosion, or armored column pierced by thousand of shells in seconds before the shots are even heard, they are guaranteed to make an impression on our adversaries."

  strat_bomber_tech_1:0 "R-Plane Bomber"
  strat_bomber_tech_1_desc:0 "As the need to hit the enemy directly in their land increases, new designs come from ingenuity. We need to be smart when it comes to conflict, strike both at their troops and war machine. Destroying infrastructures and military factories require good range and bomb payload as well as some defensive capabilities from enemy fighters. As such, a monoplace design reinforced by struts and with four engines in a double-line tandem configuration let us create a sturdy bomber design able to carry an impressive payload of upward of fifty-two 50kg bombs in a large internal bomb bay, as well as three machineguns in armored turrets. This configuration allows large autonomy in enemy territory, both in terms of ammo and fuel, as well as defensive capabilities. It is time to strike their homeland."
  strat_bomber_tech_2:0 "Rotary-Engine Bomber"
  strat_bomber_tech_2_desc:0 "A four-engined, conventional monoplane design around a large fuselage forms our new bomber design. High-powered turboprop engines allow more armament to be carried, and this is put to good use. With defensive armaments increased to heavy machineguns and sometime even autocannons, aimed via gun-laying radars, along with bomb bays able to carry a variety of ordonnance upward of 1 ton, this bomber design can raze entire factories to the ground a single mighty high-altitude attack runs. Bigger fuel tanks let them strike even enemy capitals from our territories, and high-altitude tactics let them bypass most enemy interceptors and AA fire. The final improvement is a complement of flak jackets and helmets given to the crew to protect them against bullets, as well as steel plating protecting critical part of the planes such as gunner turrets, pilot compartment and bomb bay."
  strat_bomber_tech_3:0 "Jetbomber"
  strat_bomber_tech_3_desc:0 "Jet engines allow for ligher and faster bomber designs, letting them strike their target and come back home safely in record time, sometime before they are even spotted. More sophisticated bomb loads such as fuel-air weaponry, guided glider bombs and hardened bunker penetrators, combined with terrain scanning search radars for accurate bomb runs even in plain darkness, increases their strategical capabilities. Advanced avionics such as pulsed doppler radars to detect air threats and an astro-inertia navigation system let our bomber formations find the fastest way to and from their target, while a multitude of those informations linked to a rear-facing rotary autocannon provide good defenses even against advanced fighter designs."
  strat_bomber_tech_4:0 "Nuclear Jetbomber"
  strat_bomber_tech_4_desc:0 "With the advent of manufacturable nuclear technology, our bombers can hit the pinnacle of strategical destruction technology. Incredible operational range, higher service ceilling and the addition of a multi-spectrum flare countermeasure system all integrates seamlessly into the latest low-drag, high speed fuselage design our engineers have created. A rotary bomb-bay allows much faster bomb runs as well as decreased scattering of ordonnance, while integrated guided glider systems allows our crew to perfectly pinpoint and strike strategical assets. Our enemy can barely rest now, as they know that at any moment a huge array of bombs, missiles and sub-projectiles could slam into their factories and homes."

  cargo_plane_tech_1:0 "Transport Glider"
  cargo_plane_tech_1_desc:0 "Cheap and lightweight, those wooden transport gliders are carried on the back of flatbed 8x8 trucks, and fired with the help of a dual catapult and rocket launch system, allowing for good range for such an aircraft. Otherwise unremarkable, and with low agility, those gliders can still be useful to drop supply crates for our ground troops stuck in low-supply areas or even fighting for their lives behind enemy lines. "
  cargo_plane_tech_2:0 "Cargo Plane"
  cargo_plane_tech_2_desc:0 "A powered cargo plane with a twin engine design, this tranport aircraft is much better suited to combat operations, as it includes multiple machineguns for defensive purposes and an increased top speed that lets it manage supply drops in hostile environment. A better drop system with improved parachutes let them also deliver bigger payloads, ranging from ammunition to small arms or even anti-tank weaponry."
  cargo_plane_tech_3:0 "Dreamlifter"
  cargo_plane_tech_3_desc:0 "Huge transport aircrafts armed with defensive autocannons and incredible strategical range, this transport plane can carry enough supply to arm entire battalions for months. A ground-sweep radar scanning for flat terrain to allow easier drops is paired with an IFF signaling device on each supply crate to let our troops find them much faster and easier. Increased speed owing from it's quadruple turbo-prop engines also let it dodge enemy anti-air fire easier."

  blimp_tech_1:0 "Combat Blimp"
  blimp_tech_1_desc:0 "A multipurpose, lighter-than-air aircraft composed of a gondola and non-rigid balloon, this aircraft is considerably costly to produce. But it is very polyvalent. With the possibility of carrying both hand-thrown shells, heavy machineguns for anti-aircraft fire and even high-explosive bombs, such an asset can dominate both the sky and the ground. With it's overpressured ballon, it is much harder to bring down than it would be assumed. An armored gondola and swivel mounts for the heavy machineguns, as well as multiple ammunition boxes, will give a hard time to any attacking fighter. They are, however, relatively slow. With a single tail-mounted propeller engine providing thrust, it cannot move swiftly. It can, however, provide fire support in an enormous range around it's launching point."
  blimp_tech_2:0 "Assault Blimp"
  blimp_tech_2_desc:0 "While our blimps provide relatively static targets to enemy anti-air guns, their sheer size and defenses let them become aerial behemoth. With reinforced armor plating on an enlarged gondola, as well as autocannon armament and internal bomb rack, they become even harder to shoot down, and can dominate entire battlefields in a hell of bombs and shells. Rudimentary air radars along with gun-laying devices can shoot down attacking aircraft while 250kg high explosive bombs can destroy any ground target. And for anyone thinking they can outrun it, a gun turret placed at the bottom of the gondola fitted with an autocannon and firing both armor piercing and incendiary shells will quickly bring them down. Even though we could never make such an aircraft swift, we can still improve it's tactical speed with a second propeller engine and it's strategical range with armored fuel tanks."
  blimp_tech_3:0 "Superfortress"
  blimp_tech_3_desc:0 "At the price of almost ten advanced fighters, it would at first seem like a bad investment. But no one has experienced true joy until they've seen the multiple rotary autocannon and flak guns shred airplanes to pieces while combined breech-loaded mortar and rocket turrets annihilate ground target. Entire batteries of anti-air guns useless against the thick composite armor and reinforced balloon, panicked soldiers running for their very lives at the mere sight, entire battalions turning back and crying to whatever god they worship to save them. Some may say it's a waste of budget, but for the few daring enough, it is a dream come true."
  blimp_tech_4:0 "Nuclear Superfortress"
  blimp_tech_4_desc:0 "Carte blanche was given to our engineers in terms of budget to improve our combat blimps, and while embezzlement rumours have been going around, they are indeed just that. Rumours. With all the autocannons increased in caliber and given accurate gun-laying radars, rockets switched for armor piercing missiles, and mortar transformed into low-velocity howitzers, few can stand against our might. With the armor of a pre-war tank for the gondola alone, capable of stopping direct aerial missile hits, and a hugely reinforced nano-kevlar ballon with internal bulkheads and emergency air pumps, nothing can down it. A nuclear core paired with multiple jet engines give it swift speed for such a size along with the best range any aircraft can ever hope to have, while comfortable crew quarters almost makes it a flying village. Nothing can stand in our way now."
