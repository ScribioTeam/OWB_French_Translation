 # Infantry Training
 #----------------------------
  unit_training_tech_1:0 "Warrior Training"
  unit_training_tech_1_desc:0 "A basic restructuring of our training program to focus on stress resistance courses, and continuous squad bonding drills. This allows us to root out undisciplined soldiers early, along with those too frail mentally to withstand the rigour of combat, decreasing training time."
  unit_training_tech_2:0 "Militia Training"
  unit_training_tech_2_desc:0 "Military drills aimed at basic defensive operations are carried out across our army. The cornerstone of it is teaching our troops basic guerilla tactics, proper skirmishing procedures as well as field fortification building."
  unit_training_tech_3:0 "Guerilla Tactics"
  unit_training_tech_3_desc:0 "A deeper understanding of guerrilla tactics, and wasteland operation training given by experienced survivalists, let our army strike in unexpected places, as well as take advantage of the rocky terrain or sandstorms."
  unit_training_tech_4:0 "Platoon Training"
  unit_training_tech_4_desc:0 "Officer training and platoon organization allows our command structures to be simplified when compared to loose militia units. Lieutenants trained in field operation and battlefield thinking will also increase our tactical readiness."
  unit_training_tech_5:0 "Basic Drill"
  unit_training_tech_5_desc:0 "Standardized physical drills, and intense training programs, increases the endurance and resilience of our troops. Pairing this with tactical retreat exercises let our soldiers regroup and reorganize much faster from a failed assault or strategical movement."
  unit_training_tech_6:0 "Mechanized Training"
  unit_training_tech_6_desc:0 "Mechanized combined operations along with general motorization can be used to our advantage. Skirmishing troops in light motorized vehicles can quickly engage and tie-up enemy assets, allowing our forces to reinforce ongoing assaults faster."
  unit_training_tech_7:0 "Objective Security Tactics"
  unit_training_tech_7_desc:0 "Massive distribution of entrenching spades is carried out to all soldiers in our army. Combined with specialist shock training dealing with rapid area securing, and squad-level sweep tactics, this allows our troops to quickly secure and reinforce positions."
  unit_training_tech_8:0 "Virtual Reality Training"
  unit_training_tech_8_desc:0 "Pre-war training pods, loaded with all previous improvements to our army drills, let our troops become experienced soldiers much quicker with less ressources directed toward boot camps."

  heavy_infantry_tech_2_desc:0 "Reinforcing the natural weak spots discovered in our Enforcer's armor with additional armor plating, as well as providing them with purpose-built military helmets instead of their scavenged equipment, should make them much more resistant to small-arms fire. While it will slow them down further, few of them would turn down the opportunity to resist a rifle cartridge to the skull."
  heavy_infantry_tech_3:0 "CqC Training"
  heavy_infantry_tech_3_desc:0 "Now that we have acquired experience in the use of our Enforcers, we can begin developping a uniform, specialized operational doctrine which would vastly increase their effectiveness in close-quarter combat. Better hand-to-hand training alongside squad suppression techniques go a long way in making them more effective on the field."
