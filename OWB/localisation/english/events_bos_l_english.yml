  nf_brotherhood_history.1.t:0 "One Fateful Bullet"
  nf_brotherhood_history.1.d:0 "The 15th of October 2077 was a fateful day, the day when Roger Maxson first rose to the challenge. His previous commander, Colonel Spindel, not capable of taking the guilt of what he had protected, had committed suicide. The full extent of what had transpired, which had been kept secret from even those soldiers guarding it, now came crashing down. Human experimentation with genetic modification, initially with the intent of curing and protecting against any and all illness. But intent rarely remains pure, and seeing the potential the US Government decided to instead create super soldiers, forcing prisoners of war and others to be exposed to different strains of the Forced Evolutionary Virus. Creating monsters and abominations, most of which were not even capable of life. Perversions of humanity, ordered by those who had already become monsters inside. It was the last straw that was needed for Maxson to cut all ties with the United States of America. His men followed. One scientist after another was interrogated, judged and found guilty. Their punishment? Summary execution. On the 20th of October, on all frequencies, Roger Maxson and his soldiers declared their secession from the United States. A broadcast of intent, of justice. Their families were soon after transferred to Mariposa, in fear of what might happen to them should the government finally decide to act. Yet no response came, even as nuclear death rained from the sky on the 23rd."

  nf_brotherhood_history.2.d:0 "It was almost as if fate itself had decided that they should succeed, the bombs being the answer to their challenge towards those cruel masters of old. Retribution in flames struck down all, guilty and innocent alike. The soldiers sat, covered with their families, waiting for Armageddon to be over. By some miracle did Mariposa not suffer a direct hit, and the underground facilities and bunkers were secure enough to keep them safe, for a time. They were not soldiers of the US army anymore, but just a band of survivors held together by the iron will of Roger Maxson. The 25th marked a special date as another hero, Sergeant Platner, left for the surface, to return with the news that the air was clean. It was quickly decided that Mariposa needed to be abandoned. The crimes committed here and the risk of further nuclear strikes weighed too heavily on the place. After the last few scientists had been executed, their punishment delivered, the exodus began. The former servicemen and their families all followed Maxson. On the 27th of October, they left Mariposa behind, to never return. Their new destination, the Government bunker at Lost Hills. Our home."

  nf_brotherhood_history.3.d:0 "After the adrenaline of having survived Armageddon settled, despair took hold. Everything was lost, the past gone, what even was left. What purpose? Everything they had believed in, even the flag, had turned out to be nothing more but a playground for those who desired power. For those who used technology to dominate. Yet once more, it was Maxson that gave hope, that was restored. He gave new symbols, meaning, purpose. To guard the future from the past, to never repeat what had happened before. to safeguard humanity from it's own greed. The brotherhood was born and with it, a dynasty that would safeguard humanity."
  nf_brotherhood_history.3.a:0 "Tempered by Purpose."
  nf_brotherhood_history.4.t:0 "Our Brotherhood"
  nf_brotherhood_history.4.d:0 "Every organisation needs structure, especially those made to safeguard humanity. Three distinct branches, each with their own purpose and goal. The scribes, to store, keep and develop knowledge. The knights to maintain and preserve technology and the Paladins, to fight and protect. Those not ready to choose yet, are initiates. Learning and training to one day find their calling and step into one path of their choosing. Beyond these three branches are the elders. Usually senior Paladins that served with distinction. They are the ultimate authority in all brotherhood matters, even if they often delegate. These elders form a council, which is lead by the high elder. The high elder is not the sole master of the brotherhood. The council can overrule the High Elder at any time and even replace them. Lastly, the codex, those fundamental tenants written by our founder Roger Maxson himself. Nobody stands above the code."

  nf_brotherhood_history.5.d:0 "They were like children, playing with technology, recklessly. Thinking they can restore what was in the past without actually understanding what the past was. They wanted to reintegrate technology that the wasteland was not ready for. They fought over it, we fought back. It almost seemed as if we could win, but the NCR is an entirely different beast. As reckless as they are with technology, as numerous are they. We damaged their economy, and their pride, but ultimately, we were too few. Now we are hiding within our fortified bunkers. We are hiding from those who wish to restore what failed once."

If only we had more of them. \n\n\n§BPaladins function a lot differently than other units, their numbers are very limited. They can not be trained by normal means and their templates can not be edited. They are deployed via specific decisions. Either as units on the field, direct aid to other chapters, or for expeditionary purposes to explore pre war ruins. Paladins are not easily replaced, every loss hurts. Take good care of them§!."

In desperate times are they also used as scouts, due to having no access to power armour. Power armour is reserved for the Paladins, our best warriors. Yet what a knight might lack in combat prowess, he or she, makes more than up for in technical expertise. If something breaks, a scribe can fix it with closed eyes and only one arm."

One Brotherhood squad, led by High Elder Maxson II himself, located the Vipers. Expecting the raiders to break and run at the sight of such a heavily armed force, Maxson did not take into account the Vipers' zeal and ferocity... or their poisoned weapons.

However, during the battle it become apparent that the seething mass that was the NCR's grand army was vastly outmatched, and suffering heavy casualties.

Additionally, a new Steel Rangers Joint Administration is to be created in the state of Maxson Territory, to have the technology within the Lost Hills Bunker assist in the development of Maxson State.\nThis is really too good of an offer to pass up."

But those from the Maxson brigade, who had grown up within Brotherhood territory? They understood more than any other group, and following their disbandment after the war, went on to become a series of militias loosely associated with the Brotherhood of Steel."
