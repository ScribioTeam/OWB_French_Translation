 # Decisions #
  produce_consumer_goods:0 "Produce Consumer Goods"
  produce_consumer_goods_desc:0 "Whilst the war machine is vital to our survival, the people need their luxuries too. By switching some of our focus into the consumer domain, we can increase their support for us."
  produce_consumer_goods_wtt:0 "Produce Consumer Goods"
  produce_consumer_goods_desc_wtt:0 "Whilst the war machine is vital to our survival, the people need their luxuries too. By switching some of our focus into the consumer domain, we can increase their support for us."
  prioritise_living_standards:0 "Prioritise Living Standards"
  prioritise_living_standards_desc:0 "It is by no means a stretch to say our people live in good conditions. They do not. The people are in need of some care and attention from us, so better now than later! The changes will be slow, but we'll get to a more stable society in time."
  research_consumer_tech:0 "Prioritise Consumer Technology"
  research_consumer_tech_desc:0 "Our R&D department is of the utmost importance to our nation. It develops new armour and weapons, upgrades old versions and modifiers what we find in the waste. Maybe it's be time we spend a bit of the R&D budget on things the people want, rather than what the military needs."
  basic_hygiene_education:0 "Basic Hygiene Education"
  basic_hygiene_education_desc:0 "The people have forgotten the hygiene we once had in the old world. As a result, disease spreads like wildfire and people live in little better than pigsties. We should divert some of our precious time to educating them with better hygiene practices!"
  focus_on_internal:0 "Focus on the Internal Sphere"

  purge_elites_desc:0 "The leading body has grown since we took power, expanding to be able to control the country effectively.

The people will undoubtedly be happy at this change."
  militarized_society:0 "Militarise Society"

  promise_of_loot:0 "The Promise of Loot"
  promise_of_loot_desc:0 "If there is one thing our people will fight passionately for, it is for material reward. There is great loot to be won from war - if we remind them of this fact, they will undoubtedly support any wars we wage more."
  mobilise_people:0 "Mobilise the People"

  patriotic_boost:0 "Seize on Patriotism"
  patriotic_boost_desc:0 "The first war has begun, and our people are filled with zeal for our cause. We can seize on this boost now - the people will flock to our banners quicker, and will support the cause more in the immediate term, but the support will slowly ebb away!"
  extend_mil_production:0 "Emergency Military Production"
  extend_mil_production_desc:0 "In this time of war, we can draft in extra consumer goods factories to temporarily boost the war effort. The people will grumble, but the guns are what is needed now, not their undying support."
  focus_mil_research:0 "Extend Military Research"
  focus_mil_research_desc:0 "To win the war we need to pull ahead on the RnD front. Extra resources are needed to be diverted to our research efforts at the expense of some civilian research projects."
  encourage_weapon_production:0 "Encourage Weapon Production"
  encourage_weapon_production_desc:0 "More weapons! A common phrase amongst our leadership during this war.

  __territory_disputes:0 "Territorial Disputes"
  __territory_disputes_desc:0 "When a nation's long term territorial conquest plans are disrupted by another, they can demand these territories be returned to them. Failure to return these territories in a timely manner is a rightful justification for war."
  demand_stolen_territory:0 "Demand Our Rightful Territories"
  demand_stolen_territory_desc:0 "They have stolen what is rightfully ours! We shall issue an ultimatum demanding they cede all disputed territory, or we will take it by force."
  return_stolen_territory_timer:0 "§RUltimatum Deadline§!"
  return_stolen_territory_timer_desc:0 "We must cede all the disputed territories by this deadline, otherwise they will have justification to go to war."

  return_stolen_territory:0 "Return Disputed Territories"

  seize_property_generic:0 "Seize Civilian Arms"
  seize_property_generic_desc:0 "Every farmer has his own shotgun, necessary to keep pesky wildlife away. But in times of need can we take these weapons to arm our soldiers. Not that the farmer can do much about it, apart from loudly protesting."
  seize_property_raider:0 "Seize Raider Arms"
  seize_property_raider_desc:0 "Raiders have guns everywhere. Stockpiled away in caves, hidden abodes, where ever one could hide something that can cause harm. Let's use those hidden stockpiles."
  ballot_draft_settler:0 "Ballot Draft"
  ballot_draft_settler_desc:0 "Desperate times, desperate measures. Sometimes the only way to get more capable soldiers is by enforcing a ballot. Those who draw the short straw, will help us make it out of this so that we might see a brighter future."

  ruthless_drills:0 "Ruthless drills"
