  RRG_jacob_martinez_desc:0 "Born and raised on the north bank of the Rio Grande, Jacob was the third son of an influential arms baron, one of many who dotted the north of the Republic. His father neglected him, pushing him down a different path from his brothers, away from the family business and into politics. Perhaps his father had hoped to use him as a lobbyist, but by the time Jacob was first elected as a deputy, he had long since cut ties with his family."
  RRG_carlos_avila:0 "Carlos Avila"

He's worked for the Republic for the last 200 years, and his accumulated experience make his predictions of events seem like uncanny foresight. Many jest that his unnatural dedication to his various positions over the years shows that he's gone feral: but in truth, his fierce loyalty to the Republic might be all that's keeping him sane."

His punishment was to watch his fellow soldiers slaughter the local population. Paullus, in his hubris, had forgotten who he was dealing with. In a stunning show of martial prowess, Gaius performed reverse decimatio on his captors, escaping with his life and the love of it. Fleeing to the Republic, he vowed to turn his back on barbarism, and become an honest man."
