  BGC_bellores_sunshadow_desc:0 ""She was his shield. and he was her sword," so goes the mythos behind Fairest Lady Sunshadow and the Duke of Langenburg. Though she was never present in any form of combat situation, the duchess plays into her own legend-- and what else is there for the duke to do but oblige his beloved? \n\n Once the Duchess of Dawfin, Lady Bellores Sunshadow has been forced into the shadows, to walk among the commonfolk of the Boggy Creeks, in a wretched and glum span of marsh with terrifying monsters and nefarious ne'er-do-wells."
