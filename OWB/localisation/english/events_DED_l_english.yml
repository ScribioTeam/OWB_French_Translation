    nf_ded.5.t:0 "The Highliners"
    nf_ded.5.d:0 "Wandering the Lifeline, you may at times hear a beautiful windchime made of metal and glass shards. While made of garbage, its craftsmanship is exquisite-- its passion undeniable. \n\n These are the work of the Highliners, the survivors that sought to live their lives in ultimate peace far from the sorrows and woes of their Deadliner and Flatliner cousins. Many of them were craftsmen in the old world, and many of them never gave up their work, even in the face of the penultimate destruction. In the face of extinction, no doubt they would be willing to change their hands from necklace crafting to construction."
    nf_ded.5.a:0 "Hopefully those skills translate."
    
    nf_ded.6.t:0 "The Flatliners"
    nf_ded.6.d:0 "The Flatliners-- a group of nihilistic, forlorn souls scattered into small communes in only the most derelict corners of the Lifeline. Many of them have such a lifeless tinge to their stride that even the ferals don't bother touching them. Thought they've been hostile in the past, we have no other option but to extend the hand. Above us, danger wracks the surface like a plague literally and figuratively.\n\n Their leader, Morose, is quick as a whip, and smart as a paper's edge. He knows his way around a gun well, and, even better, how to navigate the really devastated portions of the Lifeline. No doubt his recruitment will grant us a significant advantage."
    nf_ded.6.a:0 "Strange bedfellows indeed."

    nf_ded.102.d:0 "Deadline has sent us an offer, hoping to gain our trust in an alliance dedicated to restoring peace and order to the Plaguelands."
    nf_ded.102.a:0 "How Could We Refuse?"
