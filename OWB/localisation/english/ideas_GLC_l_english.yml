    glc_guides_of_the_cradle_desc:0 "Glow's Cradle is a haven for ghouls. A safe place where one can experience the glow's beauty and radiance. These lands are highly irradiated with only a handful of pockets and pathways being safe for travel by non-mutants.\n\nThe guides of Glow's Cradle make sure that ferals find themselves inside of the most irradiated of the pockets, so they may feel the glow envelop and embrace them until their dying moment - a fate the Brotherhood of the Glow considers being of the utmost divine, the peaceful ascension to become one with the Glow.\n \nNot only does this protect the people travelling these lands, it also protects those who're outside of it, for none can pass without risking certain death."

The brothers and sisters of The Glow guide these pilgrims for any kind of tribute, whether it's a single bottlecap, a weapon or even a robot - whatever one can afford is all that is asked. These guides protect the Pilgrims with the use of radioactive contraptions to explore themselves and their assailants in radioactive goop, either killing them or turning them into ghouls. Afterwards, this goop is cleaned off to clear the path once more. Whether by Pilgrims joining the Brotherhood or by want-to-be assailants being attacked and ghoulified, their numbers always grow."

    glc_glowing_rebels_desc:0 "After The Great Glowing One's decrees and tyrannical takeover of the lands south of the Cradle, the Brotherhood seceded and kept the Northern lands, exiling their former leader. While the Brotherhood is capable of defending their lands against all others, they are at a disadvantage against the Luminous Ones, who know the lay of the land in and out and are immune to the effects of radiation, just as the Brotherhood are. Not everyone is loyal to the Brotherhood within their own ranks, either..."
