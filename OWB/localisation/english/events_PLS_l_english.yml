PLS_event.1.t:0 "The Story of the Butcher"
PLS_event.1.d:0 "The name of Paullus Infames has long been forgotten. But people of New Mexico still remember him. To them, however, he is known as the Butcher of New Mexico, the monster who 12 years ago swept through New Mexico without leaving a living place behind. People especially remember him for..."
PLS_event.1.a:0 "...his inhuman cruelty."
PLS_event.1.b:0 "...the way he took everything he could from them for his campaign to Rio."

PLS_event.2.t:0 "Too Close to the Sun"
PLS_event.2.d:0 "But Paullus hasn't had enough atrocities in New Mexico.. He wanted more wars. More blood. More glory. So he asked Caesar for 5,000 legionnaires to take the legion's tidbit, the Rio Grande. And Caesar gave the go-ahead.\nBut Paullus was too careless, too confident. President Mora, thanks to his charisma and military skills, was able to raise all of Mexico to fight Paullus' legions.\nPaullus fell, unable to break Mexican unity, but in every defeat there is a lesson, and Paullus learned..."
PLS_event.2.a:0 "...the importance of patience that day"
PLS_event.2.b:0 "...the importance of a good plan that day."

PLS_event.3.t:0 "The Hand of Caesar"
PLS_event.3.d:0 "When news of Paullus' defeat reached Caesar, he was furious, and sent many assassins to finish off the one who had disgraced his name. But Paullus was too good at hiding and too effective at taking out the legion assassin, and a few years later Caesar decided there was no point in wasting resources on this disgrace.\nThough the assassins stopped appearing many years ago, Paullus still lives in fear that sooner or later Caesar's hand will catch up with him."
PLS_event.3.a:0 "The hand of Caesar will get me sooner or later."

PLS_event.4.t:0 "The State of Warband"
PLS_event.4.d:0 "That's how I ended up here: disgraced by Mora, I found nothing better to do than make life worse for the Rio Grande by making periodic raids on their settlements. The legionnaires who survived stayed with me, but in time raiders began to appear in the warband, wanting a piece of the Rio. \nAnd so it's been a long 12 years. I am still waiting for the moment when Rio will weaken, and then I will strike. Win or lose. It doesn't matter, because..."
PLS_event.4.a:0 "...we have nowhere to go anyway."

PLS_event.5.t:0 "The Wolf Howls"
PLS_event.5.d:0 "We never considered Paullus a serious threat, so we took no action against him. However, the chaos in Rio apparently gave him hope of a comeback, and now we hear that activities in the west are becoming more and more dangerous for us. More and more raiders are joining the Paullus's Warband, we must do something..."
PLS_event.5.a:0 "§R...before it is too late.§!"

PLS_event.6.t:0 "§gThe Rise of the Wolf§!"
PLS_event.6.d:0 "Our disregard of Paulus' raids resulted in his being able to recruit enough raiders into his squad to pose a serious threat to Rio. And now he goes to Gloria to get his vengeance."
PLS_event.6.a:0 "Let's put an end to the butcher!"
PLS_event.6.b:0 "§OSecond Time's a Charm...§!"

PLS_event.7.t:0 "A Fellow Rio Hater?"
PLS_event.7.d:0 "It looks like Centurion came to us, but he's not connected to the Legion, which is an interesting situation.\nDoes he want to join forces against Rio? Why not, together we'll blow up Gloria a second time."
PLS_event.7.a:0 "The cursed alliance was born."

PLS_event.9.t:0 "My Only Chance"
PLS_event.9.d:0 "For 12 years I have waited and prepared, and now the moment has finally come when I can strike. It's time for me to find out how sweet revenge is."
PLS_event.9.a:0 "Everything is coming together..."

PLS_event.10.t:0 "On My Own"
PLS_event.10.d:0 "I'm not going to cooperate with these TAAs, all I need are my Legionnaires and no one else. Also a big help will be the new Raiders who heard about what happened in Rio and are coming to me to get their tidbit from the Rio Grande with my help."
PLS_event.10.a:0 "The end of the Rio Grande is near."

PLS_event.11.t:0 "Rio in Chaos!"
PLS_event.11.d:0 "There was an explosion in Rio! I don't know what happened, but rumor has it that TAA stabbed Rio in the back. I have to catch that momentum and make my move."
PLS_event.11.a:0 "This is my time to shine."

PLS_event.12.t:0 "Sweet Victory"
PLS_event.12.d:0 "I... We did it! Rio was defeated at the hands of my loyal legionnaires. My revenge was finally done. But this is not the end, Rio is in chaos after the collapse of the government, and Mora, that sneak bastard, has managed to escape with a group of his caballeros and is waging a guerrilla warfare against me."
PLS_event.12.a:0 ""I never thought it would be easy""

PLS_event.13.t:0 "The Smell of Ashes"
PLS_event.13.d:0 "I missed the smell of ashes, the smell of my enemies' burning bodies and their pathetic attempts to appeal to my mercy with screams. But there is no mercy for my enemies, especially for Rio Grande."
PLS_event.13.a:0 ""And it burned with a cleansing flame.""

PLS_event.14.t:0 "Sweet Voice of the Serpent"
PLS_event.14.d:0 "The serpent's words are sweet, but the poison hides behind the sweetness of his words. Todd wants deals, wants to make us his contracted slaves. Will I take the serpent's bait?"
PLS_event.14.a:0 "Let poison into my mind."
PLS_event.14.b:0 "The serpent dare not tell me what to do!"

PLS_event.15.t:0 "Bastard Paullus"
PLS_event.15.d:0 "That bastard shot our messenger! Does the expression "don't shoot the messenger" mean anything to you?! He will pay for his refusal to cooperate."
PLS_event.15.a:0 "Go to hell, Paullus"

PLS_event.16.t:0 "The Sun in My Hands"
PLS_event.16.d:0 "He hid from me for a long time, but Maura was finally found and captured. He fought bravely against my Legionnaires up to the moment of his capture, which deserves my respect.\nBut what to do with the sun that burns brightly in my hands? Put it out, or take it for myself?"
PLS_event.16.a:0 "Put it down."
PLS_event.16.b:0 "Steal the Sun."

PLS_event.17.t:0 "The Road of Opportunities"
PLS_event.17.d:0 "Many roads are open before me after the capture of Rio, but there is only one choice I can make. Do I follow my anger, or is there a new path for me?"
PLS_event.17.a:0 "I follow my anger."
PLS_event.17.b:0 "I follow the new way."

PLS_event.18.t:0 "The Prodigal Centurion"
PLS_event.18.d:0 "Paullus? Is he still alive? And even managed to capture the Rio Grande? I'm pleased with your success, Paullus, but you're too late. Too late. And the only praise you deserve is to be shot on a cross.\nPaullus has been punished for his shame, but it would be foolish to let his victory slip away. Gaius, I command you to use the foundation he created and do my will: bring Mexico to its knees."
PLS_event.18.a:0 "Ave, my Caesar."

PLS_event.19.t:0 "The Question of Cohort Capital"
PLS_event.19.d:0 "The cohort needs capital, and we have three choices:\nMonclova, a wealthy trading city that, once developed, could eclipse the greatness of Phoenix.\nStrengthen our current capital, it is closest to the Legion and in case of danger, reinforcements won't have to go far\nAnd there is a third option, which will please the people of Rio, to restore Gloria and make it our new capital."
PLS_event.19.a:0 "Monclova"
PLS_event.19.b:0 "Verguenza"
PLS_event.19.c:0 "Gloria"

PLS_event.20.t:0 "Development of [PLS.Capital.GetName]"
PLS_event.20.d:0 "Having chosen the capital, the question of its development arises. Should we focus on the development of the city itself, make the slaves produce more weapons for the Cohort, or find something in between these two options?"
PLS_event.20.a:0 "Develop the city"
PLS_event.20.b:0 "Force people to make weapons"
PLS_event.20.c:0 "Balanced approach"

PLS_event.22.t:0 "Nothern Gunsmiths"
PLS_event.22.d:0 "Gunsmiths, also known as TAAs, can be dangerous if not dealt with immediately.\nWe can demand their submission by attacking them if they refuse.\nDon't waste time and deal with them right away\nOr could they be useful as an ally of Caesar?"
PLS_event.22.a:0 "They must bow before Caesar."
PLS_event.22.b:0 "Crush the obstacle of Caesar's will."
PLS_event.22.c:0 "They can be useful."

PLS_event.23.t:0 "The Messengers of Caesar"
PLS_event.23.d:0 "Caesar's envoys came to me with a suggestion, what should I answer them?"
PLS_event.23.a:0 "I will not bow before savages"
PLS_event.23.b:0 "Maybe there's an upside to that?"
PLS_event.23.c:0 "You've got the deal!"

PLS_event.24.t:0 "Grains From the Chaff"
PLS_event.24.d:0 "In the absence of help from the Legion, Paullus began to recruit anyone to his warband, and we need to figure out what to do with all this rabble that does not meet the standards of the Legion.\nWe can purge the warband of all problematic elements, which could cost us dearly, but the problem will be solved immediately.\nWe can do mass warband training to bring all problem raiders up to Legionnaires' level.\nAnd we can go for a less radical option than purging the entire warband, and weed out only those who will not swear loyalty to Caesar and the Legion."
PLS_event.24.a:0 "The Warband must be clean."
PLS_event.24.b:0 "Train these scum."
PLS_event.24.c:0 "Demand their loyalty to Caesar."

PLS_event.25.t:0 "The Art of War"
PLS_event.25.d:0 "Having sorted out the problem of the composition of my cohort, it was time to determine what tactics we would use to defeat our enemies.\nWe can wait for the enemy to exhaust their resources against our impenetrable troops.\nMy legionnaires can carry on like the wind against the enemy, confusing them.\nOr we can make nightly forays into enemy positions, gathering information on how to hit them harder."
PLS_event.25.a:0 "Testudo"
PLS_event.25.b:0 "Australi Vento"
PLS_event.25.c:0 "Terrorem Intra"

PLS_event.26.t:0 "Conquered Tribe"
PLS_event.26.d:0 "Another tribe is among those captured by the Legion, and since it was captured recently, we must decide what fate awaits the new slaves."
PLS_event.26.a:0 "Only men should work."
PLS_event.26.b:0 "Everyone works for the good of the Cohort."
PLS_event.26.c:0 "Give them a hope of becoming free."

PLS_event.27.t:0 "Slave Workforce"
PLS_event.27.d:0 "The fate of our slaves has been decided, and now we must determine how they can serve the Cohort."
PLS_event.27.a:0 "Send them to repair factories."
PLS_event.27.b:0 "Send them to scavenge weapons."
PLS_event.27.c:0 "A little bit of everything?"

PLS_event.29.t:0 "The Fall of Colossus"
PLS_event.29.d:0 "Everything is destined to fall sooner or later. The only difference is how soon it happens.\nWhen I heard of Caesar's death, I was hopeful that one of his heirs would carry on his work. But things always seem to go against your wishes, don't they?\nThe Legion has fallen, and I do not wish to fall with it."
PLS_event.29.a:0 "Goodbye, my Caesar."

PLS_event.30.t:0 "The Lone Centurion"
PLS_event.30.d:0 "Going to Caesar? \n§ONo§!.\nNot after what I did. The euphoria of defeating Rio still overwhelms me. It was as if I were back in the days of my youth in New Mexico.\nNo, it's still too early for me to die. \nThere's a lot to do.\n§RLots of blood to spill.§!"
PLS_event.30.a:0 "And so begins my new path."

PLS_event.31.t:0 "A Great Deal"
PLS_event.31.d:0 "What I can respect Todd Hovitser for is that even with a gun in his face, he smiles and offers me a deal. Could I refuse a smile like that?"
PLS_event.31.a:0 "Now's his chance to be a Big Shot."
PLS_event.31.b:0 "Or get a "Big Shot" in the head."

PLS_event.32.t:0 "My Dream"
PLS_event.32.d:0 "I, Paullus Infames, have a dream. To build an empire that would be the envy of bulls and bears. I want not only New Mexico to pronounce my name with fear, is that too much to ask?"
PLS_event.32.a:0 "And you will help me, my fellow slaves."

PLS_event.33.t:0 "My Best Enemy"
PLS_event.33.d:0 "And there he sits before me, the hero of Rio Grande, who failed to save his country this time. I ask the question I've wanted to ask him for years, "What are you fighting for?"\n "For my people and country, Centurion," he tells me, "And what were you fighting for when you came here the first time?" I knew the answer to that question, I sought glory, a place where I could satisfy my bloodlust.\n"What are you fighting for now, Paullus?" was a question to which..."
PLS_event.33.a:0 "...I did not know the answer for."

PLS_event.34.t:0 "My New Purpose"
PLS_event.34.d:0 ""What are you fighting for now, Paullus?" It's a question I've been asking myself a lot lately, but it was a surprise to hear it from Maura. \nI have rejected my loyalty to Caesar and my bloodlust, but what do I have without it? And then in the back of my mind I found the answer to my question. \nI still have my ambition. The desire to create something.\nThe desire to ..."
PLS_event.34.a:0 "...leave a legacy behind me." 

PLS_event.35.t:0 ""People of the Rio Grande...""
PLS_event.35.d:0 ""People of the Rio Grande, I, Paullus Infames have come to you with the message, do you wish to leave a legacy behind? Do you not wish the people of the future to remember you as the creators of all that they have?"\n"Who does not dream of such a thing. But I offer you not a dream, but an action. I will lead you into a brighter future, people of Rio Grande. To the bright future created by you and Emperor Paullus.""
PLS_event.35.a:0 "But not everyone accepted his words."

PLS_event.36.t:0 "The Second Coming"
PLS_event.36.d:0 "A messenger came to us, and it came from one whose name we did not expect to hear...\nPaullus Infames.\nEveryone remembers his atrocities, but this time he comes to us in peace? Is this a trap or the strangest joke I've seen on the wastelands?"
PLS_event.36.a:0 "We won't survive his second coming."
PLS_event.36.b:0 "Better die standing."

PLS_event.37.t:0 "The Tale of Armageddon"
PLS_event.37.d:0 "The bar was empty except for Mora and me drinking. I'd never been much of an alcoholic, but it seemed wrong to refuse him this seemingly friendly invitation. \nI didn't touch my glass, but Mora was drunk. In his state, he began to tell me interesting things. About Armageddon. A pre-war station that is locked with four locks. What about the keys? Santa Anna and Tlaloc have them. These words interested me. What will I find in the depths of Armageddon?"
PLS_event.37.a:0 "It seems that Mora is asleep."

PLS_event.39.t:0 "Help From the League?"
PLS_event.39.d:0 "We have received an interesting offer, Paullus of the Southern League offers us help in return for joining his alliance if we succeed. How shall we respond to this tempting offer?"
PLS_event.39.a:0 "This normie can be useful."
PLS_event.39.b:0 "He will help us in the fight against the Brotherhood."

PLS_event.40.t:0 "The Future"
PLS_event.40.d:0 "I have consolidated my position among the people and now I can look to the future, what awaits me there?"
PLS_event.40.a:0 "The Empire must expand."
PLS_event.40.b:0 "The League will lurk in the shadows."

PLS_event.41.t:0 "Brawl Stars"
PLS_event.41.d:0 "The Luchadors stand in the way of the Imperium, but perhaps there is one among them who shares my goal and is willing to ally with me to destroy the Legion?"
PLS_event.41.a:0 "Unfortunately, I couldn't find one."
PLS_event.41.b:0 "Together we'll fight the Legion!"

PLS_event.42.t:0 "Offer from Imperium"
PLS_event.42.d:0 "The Imperium offers me the lands of the Free Fighters in exchange for an alliance. How do I respond?"
PLS_event.42.a:0 "You've got a deal!"
PLS_event.42.b:0 "An alliance with the Legion would be more profitable."

PLS_event.421.t:0 "Generalissimo Agrees"
PLS_event.421.d:0 "The Generalissimo agreed to my deal. We have gained a very useful ally."
PLS_event.421.a:0 "Get a bottle of Rio best wine!"

PLS_event.43.t:0 "New Capital of the Imperium?"
PLS_event.43.d:0 "Gloria serves well as the capital of the Imperium, but Flagstaff was my home once, making it an option for me as a new capital.\nShould I embrace the past or look to the future?"
PLS_event.43.a:0 "Embrace the Past"
PLS_event.43.b:0 "Look to the Future"

PLS_event.44.t:0 "Rise of the Eagle"
PLS_event.44.d:0 "The eagle rose over the wasteland. Despite all adversity, he was able to overcome himself and all who stood in his way. But what is the eagle going to do next?\n\nWhat am I going to do next? The Imperium stands on top of the wasteland, but there are those who can prevent it from existing. So it's simple, the Imperium must expand and I don't need anything else."
PLS_event.44.a:0 "For the Imperium!"

PLS_event.45.t:0 "Gift From the Baron"
PLS_event.45.d:0 "Paullus regarded with interest the drink in the cup, which Baron Garzia informed him was called "coffee" and was a gift in honor of the alliance between our two nations. Paullus had heard of the drink during his long stay in Mexico, but then his allegiance to the Legion still burned within him, whose laws forbade the taking of drugs, the category of which included coffee.\nWhen Paullus decided to take a sip from the cup, he was overwhelmed by the taste. He had never tasted anything like it! He had never felt so good! But then the sensation passed, and Paullus glanced greedily at the bag of coffee.\nAfter finishing all that was in the bag, Paullus realized one thing."
PLS_event.45.a:0 "§R"I want more of this stuff"§!"

PLS_event.46.t:0 "Full Cup, Empty Head"
PLS_event.46.d:0 ""I... I feel... weird? The fog in my head won't let me think. What should I be thinking about? Oh, right... I had ambition... Dreams... What am I doing?"\nPaullus glanced at his cup; it was still full of coffee. Paullus takes the cup and..."
PLS_event.46.a:0 "...takes a sip."
PLS_event.46.b:0 "...throws it against the floor with all his might."

PLS_event.47.t:0 "Coffee My Beloved"
PLS_event.47.d:0 "I... I don't care about what's going on around me anymore. All these visions are driving me crazy. My head is splitting... I need another cup of coffee."
PLS_event.47.a:0 "§R"Addiction? I don't care anymore."§!"

PLS_event.48.t:0 "The Awakening"
PLS_event.48.d:0 "Ahhhh, what a splitting headache. How long have I been in this state? It doesn't matter, as long as I'm finally out of it.\nI have to admit that after the situation with me I am very interested in this coffee, does it really have the same effect on everyone? If it does, I have a lot of ideas on how to use it..."
PLS_event.48.a:0 "I'll create my own coffee empire! When this awful headache goes away."

PLS_event.49.t:0 "Paullus Drinks a Cup of Coffee"
PLS_event.49.d:0 "Paulus looked out the window. Behind it were new coffee plantations, worked by ahem, let's call them contract laborers. A smile spread across Paulus' face, he was proud of what he had been able to accomplish.\n\nTurning away from the window, Paulus' hand reached for a bag of coffee. This coffee was personally made for him and contained none of the substances that had once nearly sent Paulus into the abyss of addiction. No, that was the fate of everyone else who drank his coffee, but not him. \n\nAfter brewing his coffee, Paulus stood up with his cup and went to the window again. The view of the plantations was pleasing, but the coffee in the cup?"
PLS_event.49.a:0 "§G"It was as great as ever."§!"
