Whilst in this founding stage, the Followers are somewhat vulnerable to both misfortune and misdirection at our hands. Be careful though! Should we push the Followers around too much they will catch on to our plans to undermine them, and leave our lands. We walk a fine line!"

  followers_demand_demil:0 "§YFollowers Demand Demilitarization!§!"
