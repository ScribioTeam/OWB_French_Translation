  EDWARDS_DESC:0 "Born in the northern territories of the Republic, Lee Edwards grew up in the industrial heartland across the Rio Grande. He got his start working as an apprentice gunsmith as a child, but despite his promising talent in the workshop, the events of 2263 lit a fire inside him. Lee took to practising with the guns he manufactured, learning the mechanisms of everything he got his hands on. He enlisted as soon as he was able, but he's never forgotten where he came from: the old world flag around his neck is a forlorn reminder. It's filled with pride and shame, blood and joy. It's a portable piece of the old world blues.  Too bad nobody's explained to him that his namesake wasn't quite an American hero..."
  SALAS_DESC:0 "Arturo Salas didn't join the army out of patriotism, obligation, or for financial reasons. The last thing he wanted to do was patrol settlements, kill raiders, and scout the wasteland. But, as a former raider himself, he doesn't have a choice. As part of the 2268 \"Venerable Raiders Act\", he was abducted at gunpoint and press-ganged into the Republic's military to \"make up\" for his \"crimes\". Still, while he'd prefer to be roaming free and hanging bodies off of walls, Salas has grown quite fond of his frequent pay-checks."
  MILLER_DESC:0 "Miller is a second-generation Texan Brotherhood operative, born and raised far from the chapter's point of origin in the west. Infatuated with all things advanced, new or old, he's made a hobby of tinkering often. He volunteered to serve as Valentina's \"personal assistant\" as a show of good faith from the Texan Brotherhood. Despite his mundane rank and disposition, he's not lacking combat experience. His cunning intelligence has torn apart more than robots. "
  LEONCIO_DESC:0 "Born within a cartel infested slum, Leoncio spent his youth as a street urchin, stealing to make ends meet. By the time he turned fifteen his luck ran out, and he was caught and captured by a group of merchant sailors. Rather than let the boy walk, they \"hired him\" as a deckhand, plunging Leoncio into the life of a seafaring adventurer. Four decades later, now an accomplished captain, the ageing Alonso threw his lot in with the Republic of the Rio Grande, hoping to earn a hefty retirement package for his loyal service. While his morals may be questionable, his skills are undeniable."
  RAFAEL_ORTEGA_DESC:0 "One of the Republic's most highly decorated veterans, Rafael served his last tour against the Legion over a decade ago. Born into a frontier town on the cartel border, he learned to kill as a child, and enlisted young by lying about his age. Serving every position from Soldado to Colonel before retirement, he's as seasoned as they come. He earned the nickname \"La Asesora de Muerte\" during his early career after undertaking a string of brutal cartel massacres—personally."
  VERONICA_DESC:0 "Eldest daughter to President Guerra and one of five siblings, Veronica Guerra grew up in a period of uncertainty within the Republic. She watched her father struggle against corruption as a young politician, and ultimately decided to embrace her deceased mother's legacy, enlisting with the military. Veronica is well liked by her colleagues for her thorough and well-executed battle plans. She is the spitting image of the Dama del Norte, and a worthy successor to her name."

  MAROTO_DESC:0 "Hernando Maroto is the bearer of the Banner of the Feathered Serpant, and is charged with drumming up warriors to defend against the enemies of the Empire. While lacking in the skills of his more traditionally trained counterparts, he calls upon his rural background when inspiring his warriors, insisting that they must fight for both the Empire that freed their ancestors and the farmlands they were then granted."
  FRAGA_DESC:0 "Gabriel Fraga is considered to be a madwoman by most of the members of Aztlan command, but a useful one at that. Her dedication to the flayed banner she marches under mannifests in the torture of captured foes and traitors, installing her warriors with a sense of dread and loyalty that supersedes reason and tactics. It is said that the only tactic she knows is attack."
