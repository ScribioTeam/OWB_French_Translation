It's basically a kind of root vegetable, as far as I know. Unlike Banana Yucca, which require lots of care, Xander Root can be grown without any special maintenance...""

  nevada_ind_15_desc: "New American Medical Journal #43\nExcerpt from "Surviving in the Wilderness"\n"...The next day we went out again and explored the upper reaches of the valley, where we saw many wild animals. Thankfully I knew what to look for in order to keep the wounds I have taken from growing infected,  I used a local flower - red leaves with a spiked thorn - and crushed it before applying it on the wound itself.
