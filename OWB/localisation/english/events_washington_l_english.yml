  nf_washington.1.t:0 "Within the Blizzard"
  nf_washington.1.d:0 "Beneath the blizzard draped streets of Seattle lies an underground network of abandoned houses, streets, and bunkers. At its heart a foreboding bulkhead with the words \"SECURE SITE P1\" painted across it lies still. This door only opens for a select few, whose sigil was burned onto their battered armour within the depths of the facility beyond. They drag travellers down into the depths of their base, using them as unwilling test subjects, or as a labour force to excavate their damaged base. This is the seat of power for a new bloody Brotherhood, one whose path to progress is built upon the corpses of the weak. Their leader, a ghoul whose skin has fused with his armour, is known only as The Immortal. From within the sanctum at the facility's heart his orders flow throughout the ranks. His men creep through the city and abduct travellers as they scavenge, their glowing visors illuminating the gloom around them as they roam. The Washington Brotherhood travelled to Seattle to investigate Secure Site P1, a research laboratory and military complex designed to research the occult. It was believed at the time that radiation might be capable of unlocking some form of paranormal abilities, and the bunker was constructed to research this possibility in depth. Its surgeries are equipped like butcher's shops, and its halls are lined with nail marks. When the Brotherhood arrived they found a facility left abandoned, falling apart at the seams, but filled with knowledge and potential. Now, as their control over Washington expands, their grasp on Alaska begins to tighten."

  nf_washington.2.t:0 "'Invitation' from the Washington Brotherhood"
  nf_washington.2.d:0 "Beyond the borders of our proud nation, to the west where the water turns black, the ruins of Seattle fester like an untreated wound. A blizzard that never ends, streets packed with snow and forgotten bodies, and bright eyes peering up from below. Seattle is a city filled with ghosts. Ghosts that come out at night to steal people away, who jealously guard their broken capital from intruders. Now they've come to our door. An invitation from their immortal leader to embark on a journey to reclaim the old world. The man who delivered us the message stands silently, unmoving, outside in the snow - almost unnoticeable if not for the hum of his plasma rifle. To accept the invitation is to be welcomed... to refuse it is to die."
  nf_washington.2.a:0 "We have no choice but to become their puppet"
  nf_washington.2.b:0 "Our proud nation shall not agree to such ridiculous demands"

  nf_washington.3.t:0 "'Invitation' from the Washington Brotherhood"
  nf_washington.3.d:0 "Seattle used to be little more than a ruined city abandoned to the frost. Only the foolish and the desperate would dare venture that far into the frost. The men of the Maw weren't hardy enough to conquer the city - it was left forgotten. But at some point an infernal machine began to turn in that forsaken place, its dark masters slowly uncovering its machinations. Men in power armour that moved silently through the storm, who often visit the Maw to trade and to talk. Mysterious soldiers who kidnap entire communities, enslave them, and haul them into the white mist. But they're not here to trade today; they're here to offer us a deal we can't refuse. Join them in their conquest of the land, receive all the slaves and plunder we could ever desire - or we'll all be sent to Davy Jones' Locker."
  nf_washington.3.a:0 "This could be beneficial to us"
  nf_washington.3.b:0 "We will never be slaves to the Brotherhood!"

  nf_washington.4.t:0 "The Pact is Signed"
  nf_washington.4.d:0 "Today the leader of the Old Country, Grozdan Haykov, was escorted to Capitol Hill by our men. By the time he arrived at the bulkhead to the inner sanctum he was clearly petrified, almost frozen stiff like his feral brethren out in the snow. The Immortal stood observing the obelisk within the chamber, speaking to the ghoul as he did so. Grozdan Haykov and his men would receive the gifts of power armour and plasma weaponry, and they would be called upon when needed. The pact was signed."
  nf_washington.4.a:0 "Just as expected"

  nf_washington.5.t:0 "The Old Country Refuses"
  nf_washington.5.d:0 "The Immortal Elder looked down at the crumpled note in his hand with disgust, his armoured fist tightening around its frayed edges in rage. The Old Country had refused his offer of allegiance, their love of the old world having blinded them to the true nature of the wasteland. 'Take their settlements and raze them to the ground - leave none alive.' There was a silence in the room as his attendant left. 'We should have never put our faith in those mutants.'"
  nf_washington.5.a:0 "They will pay for this"

  nf_washington.6.t:0 "The Pact is Signed"
  nf_washington.6.d:0 "Port Maw's mighty gate unfurled a deep red flag from atop its battlements, the dark sigil of the Washington Brotherhood displayed for all to see. Already numerous captains of the Maw and their officers could be seen in armour, their loyalty to the Maw's new allies rewarded for all to see. Although still independent for now, the Brotherhood had already sunk its dark roots deep into the foundations of the nation. Eventually it would be theirs."
  nf_washington.6.a:0 "Just as expected"

  nf_washington.7.t:0 "Port Maw Refuses"
  nf_washington.7.d:0 "Fire swept across the Maw in the early hours of the morning, sailors looking on in horror as they found half the fleet ablaze under a red morning sky. Throughout the afternoon they laboured to douse the flames upon all the boats, and although none of them were lost, the real damage was to the sailor's hearts. In the night, while they slept in their cots, those tall figures had strode silently through the port to burn their ships. The message was clear - the Brotherhood would not forgive their transgression."
  nf_washington.7.a:0 "They will pay for this"

  nf_washington.8.t:0 "The Great Alaskan Expedition"
  nf_washington.8.d:0 "A group of our most valiant soldiers, led by The Immortal himself has set out into the cruel, frozen mountains of a land once known as Alaska. Whatever they may find there will surely help us bring order to the wastes and eradicate the remaining mutants."
  nf_washington.8.a:0 "Onwards"

  nf_washington.9.t:0 "The Great Alaskan Expedition"
  nf_washington.9.d:0 "Buried amongst the frigid crags of Denali lies a facility whose bulkhead has long been frozen over. Its halls are coated in a thin layer of ice save for one room, where a nuclear generator the size of a blue whale roars without witness. Anchorage Reserve Base 12: a lonely place. The Immortal had feverishly chased the sleeve of an old world ghost, and in Seattle he found its name. Their expedition set out immediately, planning to go farther north than any member of the chapter had ever ventured before. Even if he had to cast everyone else aside in that Frozen place to achieve his goal, the Immortal was willing to do it. His brilliant prize was finally within his grasp. When their expedition force saw the mountain on the horizon, they could feel their blood boil with anticipation. Everything had lead up to this. Chipping away at the ice and fallen rocks covering that unmarked vault door, the Brotherhood couldn't have imagined what awaited them inside. Even the Immortal only knew scraps. A utilitarian entrance, ice as far as the eye could see, and corridors filled with silence. The only sound in that place was power armour servos sighing softly. There was a single light in that dark hallway. As they approached it, their breath caught in their throats as they looked through the window it was coming from. Ghastly blue light illuminated their worn armour, cast by hundreds of cryogenic sarcophagi in rows upon rows. The truth would come to light in the hours after the Immortal enabled the activation process. These men had been placed here soon before the world ended, as a precautionary measure against a hypothetical debilitating attack against the US forces in Alaska. During such an event, they would be awoken remotely with orders to secure Anchorage. But their assignment was long redundant, and they knew that the moment they laid eyes upon their rescuers. The Immortal addressed the hundreds of vulnerable soldiers before him with bravado, his voice filled with pride. For him, this was the crowning achievement of his life. \"Men of the seventy fifth, your regiment is disbanded as of today. You are no longer U.S. Army soldiers, you are part of the only organisation who can save America. Welcome to the Brotherhood of Steel.\""
  nf_washington.9.a:0 "You serve The Immortal now"

  nf_washington.10.t:0 "Mutants Muster"
  nf_washington.10.d:0 "The greatest threat to our existance, the Washington Brotherhood, has today clashed inconculsively multiple times with our mutans along the whole stretch of our border. This in undoubtedly the preface to a wider invasion. The Brotherhood have made it very clear they seek to eradicate ghouls and mutants alike, and so our very existace is threatened. There can be no surrender."
  nf_washington.10.a:0 "We must fight to the death"
  WBH_warren_resist_brotherhood:0 "Several divisions of Super Mutants will rise to resist the Brotherhood.\n"
