  implant_militia_supply_tech:0 "Give militia implants"
  implant_militia_supply_tech_desc:0 "Our militias, amongst all other military personel, could particularly benefit from our implant program. With their lack of training or equipment replaced with advanced biological functions, we could counteract their vulnerability entirely."
  implant_infantry_supply_tech:0 "give infantry implants"
  implant_infantry_supply_tech_desc:0 "Our infantry will always be the one to truly win the fight, as such they must be outfitted with the most cutting edge of our technology to keep an edge over our enemies. Rolling out widespread programs to outfit them with the implants should help immensely in that regard."
  implant_spec_ops_supply_tech:0 "give special forces implants"
  implant_spec_ops_supply_tech_desc:0 "Our ranger forces in particular could especially benefit from vastly increased biological capabilities, as they are accustomed to operating behind enemy lines and in rough conditions. Making efforts to adapt the implants to their need would help them considerably."
  implant_power_armour_supply_tech:0 "give power armour implants"
  implant_power_armour_supply_tech_desc:0 "Our power armour forces would, at first glance, not need such things considering their vast technological edge. But, together, the mechanical and biological can form a harmony, able to strike fear into the heart of even the most hardy of soldier, no matter his origin."
  implant_vehicles_supply_tech:0 "give vehicle crews implants"
  implant_vehicles_supply_tech_desc:0 "Armoured vehicle crews generally suffer from poor physical condition because of their constant role inside of a huge metallic shell striken by the desert sun. Combining our standard implant package with increased biological cooling capabilities should improve their combat effectiveness appreciably."
  implant_rejection_therapy_tech:0 "Cybernetic Implants"
  implant_rejection_therapy_tech_desc:0 "The first step in our efforts to create cybernetic implants is the creation of a 'nanobot' medical diagnostic and healing system, contained in a standard stimpack package. Able to quickly inform as well as assist our medics in case of any rejection from biological connection points, they can also outright independently heal tissue damage with nanoscopic operations."
  implant_neural_interface_tech:0 "Neural Interface"
  implant_neural_interface_tech_desc:0 "Brains are immensely complex organs, far beyond our current capabilities to correctly map and interpret. Instead, we can use EEG technology to convert outputting brainwaves into much simpler binary. Able to be deciphered by our prototype implant's control interface, this creates an almost Robobrain-like connection between the biological and mechanical."
  implant_signal_translation_tech:0 "Signal Translation"
  implant_signal_translation_tech_desc:0 "On the other end of the spectrum, translating binary information back into brain waves would be far too difficult to accomplish. By creating new nerve endings around the implants and translating their information into simple nervous system triggers, we can have the brain instinctively react to damage or new data outputted by the mechanical components."
  implant_killswitch_tech:0 "Killswitches"
  implant_killswitch_tech_desc:0 "Integrating specialized signal emitters into our officer's helmet command HUD to interface with front-wide cybernetic systems can give us an immense advantage, allowing them to shut down unnecessary implants in soldiers engaged in low-level conflicts while overclocking the ones of those in frontline combat. Understandably, this makes the grunt rather nervous considering their opinion of high command."
  implant_safety_regulation_tech:0 "Safety Regulations"
  implant_safety_regulation_tech_desc:0 "Just like the brain regulates the body to avoid damage, our nanoscopic diagnostic system must make sure to keep implants within factory limitations to avoid possible damage to itself as well as surrounding tissues. Doing so will insure a very long service life, minimal interference to biological functions, and increased integration into a subject's body."
  implant_safety_regulation_override_tech:0 "Regulation Override"
  implant_safety_regulation_override_tech_desc:0 "Just like the human body goes above and beyond in capabilities when in extreme danger, so should our mechanical upgrades when it is needed. Our officers will be given the options to, in desperate situations, have the internal nanobot system shut down factory limitations, allowing extraordinary overclock. However, medical attention and maintenance would be required promptly after use."
  implant_shock_absorbers_equipment_tech:0 "Mark II Implant Kit"
  implant_shock_absorbers_equipment_tech_desc:0 "New generations of nanobots, equipped with advanced EMS devices, have been developped to tackle the problem of ever-increasing weight of military gear. The EMS pulses can be directed to load-bearing muscles to increase their density, as well as help promote rapid recovery of musculoskeletal traumas. This will increase our soldier's strength and resilience to any type of damage, be it from a fall or a blunt strike."
  implant_medical_maintenance_tech:0 "Medical Maintenance"
  implant_medical_maintenance_tech_desc:0 "Instead of having separate teams of engineers and medic everytime our implants must undergoe maintenance, we can integrate them further into the biological framework of the soldier's body, and gear our nanobots toward mechanical repair. This will let our medical teams go unassisted when examination is required, decreasing the downtime and increasing the reliability of internal mechanical components."
  implant_biochemical_combat_boosters_tech:0 "Enhanced combat stimulants"
  implant_biochemical_combat_boosters_tech_desc:0 "Generally a pill injested orally, Modafinil is a powerful stimulant used for hundreds of years to treat such disorder as sleep deprivation in combat situations. Usually administred in very weak dose to avoid the horrendous side effects, the integrated medical diagnostic system allow us to inject the precise required amount in our soldier for maximum effectiveness, with none of the risks."
  implant_occulus_enhancers_equipment_tech:0 "Mark III Implant Kit"
  implant_occulus_enhancers_equipment_tech_desc:0 "The production of bionic contact lenses is a further step into integrating bulky equipment directly into our soldier's body. In this case, a helmet's aim display, thermal, as well as infrared imaging have been merged into the membrane linked directly to the optical nerve, providing instictive aiming assistance as well as target detection. This allows us to considerably strengthen and lighten our current helmet design as well."
  implant_adaptive_interface_tech:0 "Adaptive Interface"
  implant_adaptive_interface_tech_desc:0 "Thinking a cybernetic package can be made into a 'one size fits all' deal is a gross underestimation of how complex the human body is. Integrating constant monitoring technology, as well as an adaptive algorythm, into the central processing unit let the medical system focus specifically on the most needed augmentations. This can range from controlled delivery of dopamine in case of psychological trauma, to specialized treatment to counter lumbago."
  implant_adaptive_respiratory_enhancer_tech:0 "Respiratory Enhancer"
  implant_adaptive_respiratory_enhancer_tech_desc:0 "The harsh terrain of the wasteland can kill even the most hardened man, thus our soldiers should be prepared to face any danger in it. Breathing hazards especially are a common problem that kill many a scavenger. The natural manner in which kidney stones form can be harnessed in an organ installed along the throat, producing constant chemical reactant in mineral form, able to break down common harmful compounds into water vapor."
  implant_monocyte_breeder_tech:0 "Monocyte Breeder"
  implant_monocyte_breeder_tech_desc:0 "The idea of the Monocyte Breeder predates our own cybernetic program, with schematics found dating several year from before the fall. A rapid cell replicator and chemical delivery system, it stimulates red blood cell production throughout the body, enhancing their production as well as genetical makeup for effective healing, even under extreme stress. This will make our soldiers able to staunch deep wound, and remain combat effective for hours after injury."
  implant_subdermal_armour_equipment_tech:0 "Mark IV Implant Kit"
  implant_subdermal_armour_equipment_tech_desc:0 "Providing our nanobots with the ability to create sub-dermal armor can significantly increase our soldier's resistance to battle damage. Implanted in the reticular dermis layer to replace the protein fiber entirely with a kevlar matrix makes the skin resistant to handgun projectiles, slashing weaponry, fire and blunt trauma. The implementation below the mechano and thermoreceptor layer also insures no diminution in sensation, making it practically seamless."
  implant_biochemical_mastery_tech:0 "Biochemical Mastery"
  implant_biochemical_mastery_tech_desc:0 "Our constant advances into the field of cybernetical integration within the human body has now allowed us to make their installation and integration almost perfect. Gone are the day of open surgery for the slightest malfunction, our units are now constantly monitored and maintained without even the slightest touch, with medical nanobots and specialized drugs bringing the rejection rate close to 0%, making them the perfect fusion of man and machine."
  implant_advanced_cybernetic_warfare_module:0 "Mark V Implant Kit"
  implant_advanced_cybernetic_warfare_module_desc:0 "Better integration of the nanoscopic diagnostic system into a centralized management module let us significantly increase the efficiency of our soldiers. Those upgrades, linked to a new stomach implants, provides more power to existing mechanical components as the body's transformation of nutrient into electrochemical energy is hijacked and linked to their cybernetics. The slight increase in hunger as a side effect is more than worth it for the soldier of tomorrow."

  implant_a_question_of_morals_tech:0 "Should we?"
  implant_a_question_of_morals_tech_desc:0 "Since the beginning of the program, we have strived for the implants to be completely seamless and integrated within the human body, making an augmented indistinguishable from a human. But... this is limiting us severely. We could go to much greater length, attain much higher heights, if only we wouldn't be restricted so. Even considering this would massively damage our reputation, but if we can attain the next stage in human evolution, should we not take the risk?"
  implant_cybernetic_warform_tech:0 "Cybernetic Warform"
  implant_cybernetic_warform_tech_desc:0 "The disregard of even the most basic human rights as well as the sanctity of it's form let us go far beyond all our previous experiments. With no restriction, we can chop off entire limbs, organs, or even huge chunks of the torso, to replace them with more efficient mechanical alternative. No thoughts were given to making subjects able to live a civilian life after this, but is it that important really? This is what the mind wipe is for after all."
