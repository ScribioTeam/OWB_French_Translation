  ROL_BANICH_NAME:0 "Bohdan Adamovich"
  ROL_BANICH_DESC:0 "Bohdan lives by a simple and pure code, one that he expects those around him to follow: Be honest and just, aid your neighbors unlooked for and without expectation of reward, and practice not pride but abstinence in all things. This code serves the Old Believers well, both amongst themselves and with outsiders. Bohdans earnest and loyal faith in God has led his fellows to treat him as a leader out of great respect and he speaks with the authority of a stern but caring father. In times of crisis they look to him for guidance, and in this age of monsters and radiation there is often another crisis around each corner."
