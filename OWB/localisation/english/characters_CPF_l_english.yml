  CPF_PIERRE_DESC:0 "A swindler by trade Pierre, if that really is his name, has proven to be much like a cockroach. Through several suspicious deaths Pierre managed to become the Electorate of Warman and Grandora seperately, this strange power base all but guaranteed his victory. Yet still there exists rumours of fraud. Pierre has attempted to recently move past his schmuck past and drag the Electorate into the future, whether they like it or not."
  CPF_DR_TOBOGGAN_DESC:0 "Dr. Toboggan (PhD pending) serves a people that have had the spectre of addiction haunt them since before the bombs fell. Although not naturally intelligent a heavy reliance on Mentats can brighten even the dullest tool, and luckily Toboggan is quite bright. Only time will tell whether he can actually cure his patients or if both Mentats and time will finally run out for the good Doctor, but for the sake of those under his care he cannot let that happen."
  CPF_JAKOB_DUNDURN_DESC:0 "Jakob Dundurn, regent of the Dundurn fortune, former Grand Electorate, and magnate of arms. Jakob has a shadow that it seems he cannot escape from, the loss of Stoon to a simpleton wastelander. The Dundurns held onto the title of Governer for 95 of the 145 years of elections and now Jakob and lost it all. What's worse is rumblings from the other Electorals of reform, revolt, and escape, should any of these pieces fall to Jakob's disadvantage the long running power of the Dundurns might finally come crashing down."
  CPF_LUGNUT_DESC:0 "Although only recently having gained enough power to be considered serious contenders in their own right, the Smashers have long been players in Vote Runs. Whether they did it for fame, profit, or just fun is up to each to decide for themselves. But with the recent ascension of Lugnut the Smashers have a new outlook, survival. Because they have been on the frontline of most every engagement in the Electorals they know firsthand just how precarious their traditions and society are, and they'll crush Heaven and Earth before they see themselves subject to anyone else's will."
  CPF_SCRAPHEAP_DESC:0 "Father Scrapheap, 3rd Archpriest of the Parish of Elbo, Holy Overseer of the Church of Saskatchewan, and Grand Laicizer of the Daemon Gabriel. \n\nFather Scrapheap had long hated the blood sport they called elections. So when Pierre shocked the Electorate by ursurping Dundurn, Father Scrapheap shocked the Parish and murdered the servant of Lucifer known as "Father" Gabriel during a sermon. Following this execution Scrapheap declared Elbo's immediate resignation from the Electorate. “If you have to ask how much it costs, you can't afford it.”Blessed are you, O Elbo;\nWho is like you, a people saved by the Lord,\nWho is the shield of your help\nAnd the sword of your majesty!\nSo your enemies will cringe before you,\nAnd you will tread upon their high places."
  CPF_TOONIE_DESC:0 "Despite only being a newcomer to the region, the Bank End Bandits have managed to succeed in monopolizing the regions finances. Toonie himself being an illusive man, very few know exactly how he continues to scheme, swindle, and steal with no reprisal. Many who have met with him tell of an angry and vengeful person, with no regard to who he insults. The kind of man who would be shot without a second thought in the rest of the wasteland, but alas is protected by very deep pockets. \n\nMoney talks. Toonie Stalks."
  CPF_PATTYWACK_DESC:0 "”Let’s keep Pleasantdale Pleasant, folks! Here’s a thought: genetically engineered police force. How? The old factory. It’s got tons of this crazy stuff we can use. Where? Toboggan said it best— we have the highest mortality rate in infants for miles. Take the ones that are sick, throw ‘em in the program. How, part 2? Take that diseased baby, slather it up in that goo, and train it to be the best. Keep in mind, folks, if you think it’s dehumanizing, then think about it like this: they’ll never know it was gonna be any different— and there wasn’t any other way they were gonna make it. At that rate, it’s just a charity program, ultimately. What do you say?” —Maxwell Chase, Mayor of Pleasantdale \n\n Many of the Faeries created by Pleasantdale had limited intelligence and communicative skills. Pattywack, however, had the benefit of a good teacher and a spry attitude-- now, in the woods north of the Electorals, she seeks to return back to Pleasantdale and stop the Faerie production once and for all... And, hopefully, to cure her kinsfolk of their inevitable, oakey end."
  CPF_FRANKIE_DESC:0 ""Elections? Qualified individuals? Electoral state or not, answer this for me: what do most of the people out here in The Katch do? Smudge up everything with their greasy fingers and lick doorknobs? I'm not letting anybody else in my chair unless their last name is 'Chase,' and that's that." --Maxwell Chase, Mayor of Pleasantdale \n\n Frankie Chase, the eldest and only remaining child of Maxwell Chase, has been forced to step up to the mayoral seat in the wake of his recent disappearance. While nervous and still only a teenager, they're trying their best to maintain the same steady composure and finnicky sense of control their father once held."
