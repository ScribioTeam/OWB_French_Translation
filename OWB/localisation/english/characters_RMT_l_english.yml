  RMT_BOOTH_CROW_DESC:0 "Booth Crow"
  RMT_BOOTH_DESC:0 "Booth was raised in a troubled tribe, one too focused on internal issues to fully realise the threats around them. A young populist by nature, his popularity grew with age, and his ideals to bar out the outside world did not rise with militarism, but instead with the ideals of cooperation. The arrival of the Marshall 'Republic' saw his tribe lose their site of worship and governance. Now, with his grip on power waning after the loss of Mount Rushmore, Booth must either fall to the way of warmongers or stand resolute in his commitment to a peaceful solution. "
  RMT_FLAMMANG_ASTHOL_NAME:0 "Flammang Asthol"
  RMT_FLAMMANG_DESC:0 "Flammang seeks to unite their people, rich and poor, for the eventual return to Rushmore. To properly unite against economic injustices one must do more than vanquish industrious men down or promote oppression for profit, they must find a common ground. Flammang's motto is simple yet effective: "A square deal for every man". Time will tell if their deal shall return them to mount rushmore."
  RMT_SHURA_HICKEY_NAME:0 "Shura Hickey"
  RMT_SHURA_DESC:0 "Seek vengence at all costs. Refuse compromise on revenge. Collect interest in payback. \n\nShura Hickey has swept the Four Fathers with these simple instructions and they follow them with fanatical reverence. Woe to those who stand in the way of Shura or their people. A shroud is encroaching on the Dakotas--a caw to action unrelenting."
  RMT_WAYLES_THOMAS_NAME:0 "Wayles Thomas"
  RMT_WAYLES_DESC:0 "Wayles knows tradition is the enemy of progress and that vengence is the detractor of growth. Her rise to leadership has proven her ideals have reached the masses. \n\n"Let Mount Rushmore stand as a monument to the past, and with all the flaws that follow with it.""
