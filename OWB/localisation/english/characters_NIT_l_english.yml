  NIT_CHIEF_NAME:0 " Chief Jeremy Oldgun"
  NIT_CHIEF_DESC:0 "The Old Gun of the Blackfoot Confederacy has seen more years go by than most, with an equally large repertoire of tales to tell. His youth was spent adventuring, wandering through the neighboring lands and scavenging what the destroyed society of old had left behind. His favorite tales to recount are those of pristine valleys in the mountains and the antics of his children, but such peaceful stories do not hook the youth as much as he’d like. Yarns featuring Yao Gaui and mad robots were popular enough but accounts of the war against Zack Company, a now defunct band of soldiers descended from pre war militia, were most sought after of all. Their destruction was the beginning of Jeremy’s ascension to chief, but was marked with more than enough bloodshed for the Old Gun’s tastes. Adventure is a fine thing, but war is an ugly beast."
