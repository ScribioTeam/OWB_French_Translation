  JURE_DESC:0 "The granddaughter of two military legacies and once leader of the CPF Crimson 2nd Battalion, Jure was helpless to halt the slow stagnation brought on by the eternal winter.  Unwilling to simply watch the CPF slowly rot away, and powerless to meaningfully stop it against the old guard holding to their status quo, she set off to aid others in the world that had come on her own terms. \n\nNow two centuries later, many different stories and too many scars to tell of them all, she has returned to her hometown, now a broken splinter state of the CPF, a monolith no longer even existing.  \n\nTrouble has been long on the horizon here, and all attempts seem to have failed to stop what shall soon be an inevitable war once again.  It is a tragedy that she may now have to put down the front which she once helped birth, but her people shall live on without it."
