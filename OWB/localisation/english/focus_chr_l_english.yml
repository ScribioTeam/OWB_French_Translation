 chr_office_for_unusual_research_desc:0 "The OFUR is the home for researchers that tend to think outside the box.

 chr_uktenas_gaze:0 "Uktena's Gaze"
 chr_uktenas_gaze_desc:0 "The gaze of the snake is said to daze and confuse people. Curiously enough, technology mimicking this already exists in the form of the mesmetron.

 chr_serpent_scales:0 "Serpent Scales"
 chr_serpent_scales_desc:0 "The horned snake is supposed to be nigh invulnerable, except on one specific spot on it's body. Intentional weakpoints seem like a bad idea, but nigh invulnerability seems like a good idea in general."

 chr_psychic_nullifiers:0 "Psychic Nullifiers"
 chr_psychic_nullifiers_desc:0 "This is technically not our design. We found records of the device in some brotherhood records we...acquired.

 chr_sky_hellions:0 "Sky Hellions"
 chr_sky_hellions_desc:0 "This high tech plane was just sitting there in an underground facility, completely ignored. Just look at this piece of art! If we manage to replicate it, even if not perfectly we will a force to be reconed with in the sky."
