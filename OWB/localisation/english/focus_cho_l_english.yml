  cho_storytellers_and_storykeepers:0 "Storytellers and Storykeepers"
  cho_storytellers_and_storykeepers_desc:0 "It has been a tradition long before the war to pass down stories from one person to another to remember our history and our legends.

  cho_holotape_archives:0 "Holotape Archives"
  cho_holotape_archives_desc:0 "While some people prefer the tactile feeling of books made of actual paper, the practicality of holotapes and terminals is not to be underestimated. This wing of the library will be dedicated to the archive of every holotape that we own and the technology to read and write them."
  cho_physical_records:0 "Physical Records"
  cho_physical_records_desc:0 "Books need special care to survive a large amount of time. It is a wonder so many survived the ravages of war and the exposure to the elements in the following years. In this wing they will be stored under optimal conditions to last as long as possible."
  cho_physical_records_tt:0 "Librarian §YGreen McCoy§! becomes available for service."
  cho_scriptorium:0 "Scriptorium"
  cho_scriptorium_desc:0 "Not every piece of wisdom comes from the time before the war. There was much to be learned in the intervening years and yet more stories to be told in the future. We will record them, on paper or tape, so that future generations can learn from them."
  cho_opening_the_library:0 "Opening the Library"

  cho_defenders_of_history:0 "Defenders of History"

  cho_the_basement_desc:0 "While we encourage people to access the library, there are certain objects that we deem as too dangerous for the average citizen.

  cho_nuclear_fission:0 "Pioneer Scouts Guide to Nuclear Fission"
  cho_nuclear_fission_desc:0 "The implications of this magazine are honestly rather disturbing. For some reason someone in the years before the war thought it would be a good idea to explain how to create your own nuclear bomb out of common household objects. Worse yet, it is clearly aimed at young children with easy to understand pictograms and a friendly cartoon frog guiding them through the steps."
  cho_nuclear_fission_tt:0 "§gYou will be able to use the nuke during wartime against the capital of your enemy.§!"
  CHO_nuke_decision_cat:0 "Nuclear Fission In Five Easy Steps"

  cho_esp_and_you_desc:0 "Based on the quality of the print and the paper it is unlikely that this pamphlet ever saw commercial distribution.

  cho_ghoul_immigrants:0 "Ghoul Immigrants"

  cho_ghoul_town:0 "Ghoul Town"
  cho_ghoul_town_desc:0 "It took a while but we managed to establish a completely new settlement from the ground up to house all the incoming ghouls.

  cho_the_tattooed_man:0 "The Tattooed Man"
  cho_the_tattooed_man_desc:0 "Among the many immigrants one stood out. Every piece of his skin was tattooed with words and images. He himself has said that he has wandered for a very long time and doesn't remember his own name anymore. People tend to just call him the Tattooed Man where ever he goes. He sparks the imagination of others when he tells the stories he has experienced himself or heard on his travels."

  cho_bound_in_chains:0 "Bound in Chains"
  cho_bound_in_chains_desc:0 "Say what you will about the Gatormaws practices along the Mississippi, they had them down pat. Efficient and effective. And considering we have a lot of them imprisoned right now, we could turn them into chain gangs, building harbour facilities and ships for us.\nPoetic justice?"
  cho_mississippi_queen:0 "Mississippi Queen"
  cho_mississippi_queen_desc:0 "The Mississippi is a teacher. She moves wildly like a dancer, bacchic with wine. She demands much, but she also gives much. We would be wise to listen to what she asks."

  cho_deus_ex_machina:0 "Deus Ex Machina"
  cho_deus_ex_machina_desc:0 "While it is clear that Diana is no god or higher spirit, but just a ghost of woman trapped in a metal shell, the similarities to one of our ancient legends are too big to ignore. She herself claims no knowledge of the story but some of our people are doubtful. Was there some intervention of a higher being, trying to guide her and us, or is it just an attempt of yet another outside force trying to control our people?"
  cho_guided_by_spirits:0 "Guided by Spirits"
  cho_guided_by_spirits_desc:0 "After many lengthy debates and comparisons with the story of the unknown woman and related legends we have decided Diana speaks the truth and that she actually has no knowledge of the story itself.
