  nf_event_brk.1.t:0 "Our Ancestors"
  nf_event_brk.1.d:0 "After the great war, the natural protection of the mountainous coasts became home to a group from which all others adapted to their culture. Some Marines from before the war, stationed defending from the invading Chinese survived in the mountains after the bombs fell. Various vessels, finding themselves stranded became shelter against the harsh winters for their crews. Natives of the land previously under occupation also gained their freedoms here after the bombs fell. All of these people form the fabric of the people in the Broken Coast, but the first group from which all others were assimilated were..."
  nf_event_brk.1.a:0 "Natives of the Coasts"
  nf_event_brk.1.b:0 "US Marines"
  nf_event_brk.1.c:0 "Sailors from foreign shores"

  nf_event_brk.2.t:0 "The Great Blizzard"
  nf_event_brk.2.d:0 "After the bombs fell, the effects did not leave. A great blackness engulfed the sky, blocking out the sun and casting a great blizzard upon the people in the Coast. Many died in the cold, their corpses freezing from the extreme cold in a matter of minutes. Out of the ashes, a people born from cruelty managed to survive this by..."
  nf_event_brk.2.a:0 "Fleeing the storm in hopes of returning"
  nf_event_brk.2.b:0 "Building shelter out of Pre-war vessels"
  nf_event_brk.2.c:0 "Bearing the storm, only the fittest survived"

  nf_event_brk.3.t:0 "Why we Fight"
  nf_event_brk.3.d:0 "Our ancestors fought and bled for the Broken Coast. The old ways are going and the new ways will lead us to glory. But we need to focus on building ourselves up. What should we focus on?"
  nf_event_brk.3.a:0 "Slaves"
  nf_event_brk.3.b:0 "Wealth"

  nf_event_brk.4.t:0 "Raiding Alvin Bleak"
  nf_event_brk.4.d:0 "Alvin Bleak slumbered softly in the night as the snow storm whipped itself up into a frenzy, the sound of wind drowning out the disorganised scramble of raiders encroaching into the settlement. The peace was broken by the sound of smashing glass, the unmistakable roar and crackle of flames, and the screams of women and children as they awoke to the blinding light of an inferno. Those who managed to resist were cut down in the dead of night, their children watching from the shadows with tears in their eyes. It would've been a mercy to kill the survivors after the flames died down—but pirates don't deal in mercy. Pirates deal in plunder and loot, and it was no surprise that the only things that left Alvin Bleak intact were valuables that would fetch a high price..."
  nf_event_brk.4.a:0 "Sleep tight!"

  nf_event_brk.5.t:0 "Breaking Whistler"
  nf_event_brk.5.d:0 "Trampling through the snowy forests of Whistler on a clear and crisp morning, our men search for more soldiers to kill. Soon after our raid into Alvin Bleak, Whistler organised their meagre \"army\" to launch a counterattack, and our forces met in a forested area along our border. This is the forest we have patrolled for the last few mornings, a forest carpeted by dead frozen bodies preserved in their final moments of agony. It will take a long, long time for these tortured faces to vanish. Whistler is on the verge of collapse, and soon, we will send them our demands. Become part of our nation: or we'll kill what's left of you."
  nf_event_brk.5.a:0 "They'd be foolish to refuse"

  nf_event_brk.50.t:0 "Broken Coast Leadership Offer Peace"
  nf_event_brk.50.d:0 "After the horrific raid on Alvin Bleak, and the numerous raids thereafter, the Broken Coast have finally sent us a peace agreement. However, unlike Kamlo who demanded drugs and slaves, the Broken Coast are demanding everything. Our land, our people, our supplies... they desire to make us a part of their twisted pirate nation. We fled Kamlo to save ourselves from this kind of rule: with our backs up against the wall, will we finally submit to raider rule?"
  nf_event_brk.50.a:0 "We have no choice, we must submit"
  nf_event_brk.50.b:0 "To hell with that! We'd rather die!"

  nf_event_brk.6.t:0 "Incorporating Whistler"
  nf_event_brk.6.d:0 "Our diplomat has been slowly eroding Whistler's autonomy without their knowledge, chipping away at their nation piece by piece until it rests firmly in our palm. He has one last demand to make of them. Now that Whistler is economically and militarily tied to us, it's time for them to be governmentally tied to us, too. We will incorporate their lands and citizens into the Broken Coast, and administrate them as an autonomous region: at least that's what we'll tell them. Their \"autonomy\" will last for only a few days, after which point they will be completely under our control."
  nf_event_brk.6.a:0 "Whistler is as good as ours"

  nf_event_brk.60.t:0 "Incorporation into the Broken Coast?"
  nf_event_brk.60.d:0 "Our friends from the Broken Coast have offered us a position as an autonomous region within their territory. Their diplomat has assured us that we will retain our independence, and that this is merely another way to tie our two nations closer together. However, many critics within our government claim this would be the final nail in the coffin for our nation..."
  nf_event_brk.60.a:0 "Submit"
  nf_event_brk.60.b:0 "Refuse"

  nf_event_brk.7.t:0 "Raiding Kamlo"
  nf_event_brk.7.d:0 "Send a few raiding parties into Kamlo to burn and loot their store houses. We'll use whatever they have against them!"
  nf_event_brk.7.a:0 "Send the Raiding Parties"

  nf_event_brk.8.t:0 "Campaigns of Terror"
  nf_event_brk.8.d:0 "Sending men in the night to burn villages and leave the heads of the villagers outside for all to see. That is the way of the Coast."
  nf_event_brk.8.a:0 "They will never sleep again"

  nf_event_brk.9.t:0 "[BRK.GetName] Sends Raiders"
  nf_event_brk.9.d:0 "Cloaked in their heavy coats, with weapons at the ready, raiders have entered our borders. They are looting our store houses, stealing our valuables, pillaging our industry and killing anyone who resists. The settlements on the border beg we send in militias and our armed fighting forces to fight back against the raiders - for the sake of our industry alone we should do it."
  nf_event_brk.9.a:0 "We can't afford to stop them"
  nf_event_brk.9.b:0 "Fight back!"

  nf_event_brk.10.t:0 "No Opposition from the Locals"
  nf_event_brk.10.d:0 "Our recent raids into neighbouring territories have gone without a hitch. There has only been token resistance to our raiding parties from the locals, and they have managed to come back with a sizeable portion of equipment, as well as some machinery and other useful items.\n\nThe territory we have raided has been left barren and bare, so we'll refrain from raiding it again anytime soon to allow the population to recover. Then we'll pillage again..."
  nf_event_brk.10.a:0 "Enjoy the spoils"

  nf_event_brk.11.t:0 "Local Opposition!"
  nf_event_brk.11.d:0 "Our raids can be a struggle - this raid is no exception. We have met marked resistance from the local populations in the form of militias and even semi-professional armed units. In the instance of this raid, just our small raiding parties won't cut the mustard. We need a larger dedication of forces to the region to crush the resistance and claim the loot that is rightfully ours."
  nf_event_brk.11.a:0 "Throw our weight behind it"

  nf_event_brk.12.t:0 "Raiders Withdraw"
  nf_event_brk.12.d:0 "The raiders from the Broken Coast have come and gone. The borderlands are in ruins - plumes of smoke dot the skyline. The attack has been truly devastating to the area, and it will take some time to recover from the attack."
  nf_event_brk.12.a:0 "Recover we must"

  nf_event_brk.13.t:0 "Border Conflict is Escalating to War"
  nf_event_brk.13.d:0 "Our recent clashes with the enemy have been inconclusive. Some ground has been won, some has been lost. A few border villages have been reduced to flaming ruins. Other than that, nothing has changed. The enemy knows this as well as we do, and appears to be taking drastic action to overcome this problem. They are mobilising for war."
  nf_event_brk.13.a:0 "Then war it shall be"

  nf_event_brk.14.t:0 "Border Conflict is Over"
  nf_event_brk.14.d:0 "Great news from the front - the border clash is over, and we have won! Enemy forces can be seen retreating before our impressive show of force, and it is time for us to at last enjoy the loot we so richly deserve."
  nf_event_brk.14.a:0 "We feast well tonight!"

 # 15.t, 16.t and 17.2 are purposefully omitted before you think I have missed them, Dominus

  nf_event_brk.15.d:0 "Great news from the front - the border clash is over, and we have won! Enemy forces can be seen retreating before our impressive show of force - we have successfully driven back the raider scum from our lands. Our people will sleep safe for a while, knowing the might of our military is there to protect them if needs be."
  nf_event_brk.15.a:0 "Good work lads"
  nf_event_brk.16.d:0 "Bad news from the front - the border clash is over, and our troops have been forced to retreat. The enemy has successfully repelled our raiders with their military, and so we need time to lick our wounds and regroup. We'll avoid launching raids against these settlements for some time - we'll lull them into a false sense of security, then we'll strike when the time is right."
  nf_event_brk.16.a:0 "Soon, lads. Soon."
  nf_event_brk.17.d:0 "Bad news from the front - the border clash is over, and our troops have been forced to retreat from the border. Raiders have overrun our border villages and settlements, destroying large swathes of land and infrastructure. Our troops have retreated to more defensible positions further back from the border, but we doubt the raiders will engage in a prolonged campaign. Instead we shall have to wait for them to retreat, lick our wounds and attempt to rebuild. We shall be more ready for them next time."
  nf_event_brk.17.a:0 "We shall rebuild..."

  nf_event_brk.18.t:0 "We Back Down"
  nf_event_brk.18.d:0 "We have tactfully decided to pull our raiders out of enemy territory to conserve manpower and equipment. We have gained valuable experience in combat through the encounter, but so have the enemy. In time we'll come back and raze their villages to the ground."
  nf_event_brk.18.a:0 "A strategic move"

  nf_event_brk.19.t:0 "Raider Back Down"
  nf_event_brk.19.d:0 "Good news from the borderlands - the raiders have ceased their activities and withdrawn from our lands. Whilst it wasn't the smashing at the hands of the army we hoped for, it is certainly a victory!"
  nf_event_brk.19.a:0 "Wonderful"

  nf_event_brk.20.t:0 "Border Conflict is Escalating!"
  nf_event_brk.20.d:0 "Our recent clashes with the enemy have been inconclusive. Some ground has been won, some has been lost. A few border villages have been reduced to flaming ruins. Other than that, nothing has changed. The enemy knows this as well as we do, and appears to be taking action to overcome this sticking point. They appear to be mobilizing more troops to send against our own - we must prepare to repel them too."
  nf_event_brk.20.a:0 "We will meet them with equal force"

 # New Victoria raid event loc

  nf_event_brk.21.t:0 "Raiders on our Coastlines"
  nf_event_brk.21.d:0 "Previously raids came infrequently. They used to be carried out by small groups, usually in the night. The ships landed in isolated stretches of the coastline - never our villages or our towns. All that has changed recently. Co-ordinated raid groups have attacked our villages and towns, doing unimaginable destruction before we could react. In response, militias have mobilized and are ready to defend our islands. Only time will tell how well they do..."
  nf_event_brk.21.a:0 "Resist!"

  nf_event_brk.22.t:0 "Successful Raid against the [HAI.GetName]"
  nf_event_brk.22.d:0 "Bodies litter the villages, bodies litter the beach. The raids against the [HAI.GetName] were carried out without mercy, and now are men are experienced in raiding over sea as well as land. This knowledge will surely become indispensable when they turn to raid New Victoria, who will surely be better defended then this irrelevant island chain. \n\nThe reasons for the continued existence of [HAI.GetName] are slim, so now is the time to annex them outright."
  nf_event_brk.22.a:0 "Valuable experience"

  nf_event_brk.23.t:0 "Smoke Stacks in the Morning Mist"
  nf_event_brk.23.d:0 "A bleak sight greeted the survivors of the night of blood. Corpses littered the villages and the beaches as far as the eye could see, many defiled and cut to pieces. The survivors could do nothing but grieve for their loved ones - grieve and hope that the raiders don't return." # Needs to use generic localisation as can fire for VIC and HAI
  nf_event_brk.23.a:0 "We will rebuild"

  nf_event_brk.24.t:0 "Failed Raid against the [HAI.GetName]"
  nf_event_brk.24.d:0 "When the first longboats touched the shore, all was quiet. The first village was asleep, and its population was put to the sword quickly. However, a young boy escaped the carnage and ran to the top of a nearby hill, before lighting a great torch that burned bright in the night. The brilliant light it shone soon spread up and down the coastline, and swiftly the whole island was awake. Our second and third landing groups, lacking the element of surprise, were pushed back into the sea by village militias - a complete failure."
  nf_event_brk.24.a:0 "We will return"

  nf_event_brk.25.t:0 "Raiders Retreat"
  nf_event_brk.25.d:0 "When the first longboats touched the shore, all was quiet. The first village was asleep, and its population was put to the sword quickly. However, a heroic young boy escaped the carnage and ran to the top of a nearby hill, before lighting a great torch that burned bright in the night. The brilliant light it shone soon spread up and down the coastline, as planned, and swiftly the whole island was awake. The second and third landing groups, lacking the element of surprise, were pushed back into the sea by our village militias - a wonderful victory over the forces of tyranny."
  nf_event_brk.25.a:0 "They will return"

  nf_event_brk.26.t:0 "Raiders from the Coast"
  nf_event_brk.26.a:0 "We, we will resist and bite!"

  nf_event_brk.27.t:0 "Victoria's Coasts are Broken" # hahaha I'm so funny help me plz
  nf_event_brk.27.d:0 "Blood, blood everywhere. That was the fate that has befallen the coastline of New Victoria. Our raiding groups have totally broken the people in the outlying villages - now our rowboats can dock anywhere along the coast without fear of having to fight their way ashore. Now we can move on to plan more ambitious raids against more built up, and well defended, areas."
  nf_event_brk.27.a:0 "The first step is complete..."

  nf_event_brk.28.t:0 "The Shore breaks the Wave"
  nf_event_brk.28.d:0 "We have underestimated New Victoria. Every time a raid group has landed, a militia has been there to meet us. Our raid groups are too small, and we seem too predictable in our choices of target. As a result, our raids have been none more than a dismal failure. We must improve if we are to loot New Victoria itself."
  nf_event_brk.28.a:0 "Soon..."

  nf_event_brk.29.t:0 "Raiders hit the Ports"
  nf_event_brk.29.d:0 "Not satisfied with the control of the coastline they exercise, the tyrannical raiders from Koover have begun conducting co-ordinated raids against our major ports. These are more well defended than the villages of the coast, but the raiders have learnt from their previous raids against us. At the moment, we seem evenly matched - let us hope we come out on top."
  nf_event_brk.29.a:0 "Fight hard, cause we are all in sight!"

  nf_event_brk.30.t:0 "Domination of the Ports"
  nf_event_brk.30.d:0 "The port of the Golden Peaks lies in ruin. Our raiding parties have wiped any life in it from existence, and most of the building are a smouldering wreck. The only structure left intact is the port itself - a structure that will help us in the future. In the mean time, however, we shall leave the port alone - we don't want to provoke an all out pitched battle when we can't yet win it."
  nf_event_brk.30.a:0 "We edge closer to Victoria"

  nf_event_brk.31.t:0 "The Night of Horrors"
  nf_event_brk.31.d:0 "We thought that we had seen the worst of the raiders when they put the coastal populations to the sword. We were wrong. The raiders launched an assault against the Golden Peaks port last night, successfully overrunning the militia and capturing the port. The rest of the night contained a massacre unknown to the world - every last man, women and child was tortured and killed. By the time our armies arrived, the raiders were gone back into the night. They have dealt a terrible wound on the island."
  nf_event_brk.31.a:0 "They are growing bolder"

  nf_event_brk.32.t:0 "The Ports Stand Strong"
  nf_event_brk.32.d:0 "An attempt was made last night to capture the port of the Golden Peaks by our raiders. We defeated the local militia in the initial clash, but the remaining forces stubbornly fought street to street defending their homes. At some point in the early mornings, a unit of the New Victoria Army arrived on the scene - our small raiding forces were no match for this well disciplined foe. We were slowly forced back into the sea - but not before burning down a good portion of the port city."
  nf_event_brk.32.a:0 "We will return"

  nf_event_brk.33.t:0 "Raiders Flee"
  nf_event_brk.33.d:0 "An attempt was made last night to capture the port of the Golden Peaks by raider forces. The initial clash with the local militia was a victory for the raiders. The militia fought valiantly street to street, losing over half the port town to the raiders before our army units arrived. At that point, the raiders were the ones on the defensive, and by the light of dawn the raiders had been pushed out of the port. Despite this victory, over half the city now lies in flames, although most of the population escaped unscathed."
  nf_event_brk.33.a:0 "Shelters are expendable, our people are not"

  nf_event_brk.34.t:0 "Operation Blizzard"
  nf_event_brk.34.d:0 "We now have dominance over the coasts, and have shown ourselves capable of the capture of port towns. It is now time to ramp it up a gear - the port of the Winter Harbour is rich but isolated, perfect for our taking. Three plans have been proposed by raider captains - one to use the seizure of the Winter Harbour as a part of an escalation to war, one to seize the harbour as a base to prepare for a war in the future, and one to seize the harbour and leave as a show of strength. Each have merit, but which plan shall we execute?"
  nf_event_brk.34.a:0 "A wide invasion"
  nf_event_brk.34.b:0 "A targeted strike"
  nf_event_brk.34.c:0 "A show of strength"

  nf_event_brk.35.t:0 "War for New Victoria"
  nf_event_brk.35.d:0 "The day we have been preparing for has come. The raiding forces have finally gathered the confidence to launch a full invasion rather than a series of raids. Last night they seized the ports of the Winter Harbour and the Golden Peaks in greater numbers than we have ever seen before. Fortunately our people are motivated to resist the raiders as they know what fate they will suffer should they win. We shall fight to the last."
  nf_event_brk.35.a:0 "We, we will take up arms and fight!"

  nf_event_brk.36.t:0 "Raiders seize Winter Harbour"
  nf_event_brk.36.d:0 "Raiders descended in unprecedented numbers on the Winter Harbour last night, and seized it with such ferocity and speed that we know little about what happened (and it is probably for the best of our stomachs that we don't find out). Its isolation and distance from Victoria made it a prime target, we imagine - we suspect that the raiders will use it as a base from which to launch their conquest of the entire island. Shall we fight back now and attempt to retake the island, or shall we prepare for them to shoot first?"
  nf_event_brk.36.a:0 "We can't fight back"
  nf_event_brk.36.b:0 "We, we will take up arms and fight!"

  nf_event_brk.37.t:0 "Decimation of Winter Harbour"
  nf_event_brk.37.d:0 "In yet another escalation, the raiders that have terrorised our lands for the past months have seized and razed the Winter Harbour. The entire region is on fire - a stark contrast to the frozen lands around it - and we have found no survivors. Only mangled corpses, and the port infrastructure, remain. Surely the raiders mean to launch a full-scale invasion soon - we should prepare to fight to the last."
  nf_event_brk.37.a:0 "War is on the horizon"

  nf_event_brk.38.t:0 "Strength Displayed"
  nf_event_brk.38.d:0 "Seizing the Winter Harbour was no small feat. Not only was there a well-armed and determined local militia, but an army unit was also stationed a few miles out of the town to repel any aggression. However, we descended on the city in huge numbers, swiftly wiping out the local militia before they could even signal the army unit. At that point we laid an ambush for the unit, wiping it too out efficiently and quickly. Finally our attention turned to the town and its people, and the response was more of the usual - rape, torture, pillage and death. Nothing remains of the Winter Harbour but the charred bones of both building and people."
  nf_event_brk.38.a:0 "They will fear us now"

  nf_event_brk.39.t:0 "War for New Victoria"
  nf_event_brk.39.d:0 "The time has come - the raiders are launching their full invasion. As we speak, ports up and down the country are being attacked by raider forces in huge battlegroups. We must put faith now in our armed forces to keep us safe - and if they fail this job, we have little to look forward to but a slow and painful death."
  nf_event_brk.39.a:0 "Fight hard, resist and do what's right!"

  nf_event_brk.40.t:0 "The Moot"
  nf_event_brk.40.d:0 "Graven roared in protest as the Moot began, his hand clenched tightly around the axe at his belt. It was time to vote for a new ruler, or so they said. The Moot had been organised in secret by a group of disgruntled captains, and now they called upon any and all within the meeting ground to oppose Graven. Ragnar stepped up, causing the gathered raiders to erupt into chaos, and the titan of a man planted his axe into the frozen earth. \"I will stand against Graven, as he is no longer fit to rule.\" A chill descended upon those gathered as they watched Graven, his grip tightening as murderous intent burned behind his eyes."
  nf_event_brk.40.a:0 "Graven's victory in the vote was to be expected."
  nf_event_brk.40.b:0 "Ragnar won by a narrow margin."
