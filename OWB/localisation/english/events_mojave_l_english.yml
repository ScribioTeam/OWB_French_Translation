  nf_mojave_brotherhood.1.d:0 "A scribe of the Brotherhood of Steel, Elijah defied convention and rose to the rank of elder, an honour usually reserved exclusively for paladins. An exception was granted for him, on the grounds of him being a genius, able to figure out the workings of a device just by looking at it. His scientific acumen was matched only by his drive to recover and develop technology. His approach towards technology, iterating and improving, rather than simply preserving it, was considered unorthodox by his peers. Elijah often dispatched scribes on tech retrieval missions, chasing all the leads he found. His drive to develop new technologies put him at odds with the more conservative members of the Brotherhood, particularly other elders."

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.2.d:0 "A pathological control freak, he would often view the people under him as mere equipment, expecting them to carry out his orders and requests unquestionably, while dissent or unpredictability on their part would not just annoy, but even outright infuriate him. By far the only person with whom he had any kind of working relationship was Scribe Veronica Santangelo, his pupil.\n\nThe conflicts Elijah had with the other members of the Brotherhood only worsened as Elijah pushed for developing new technologies and new, ethically questionable weapons. The elders, rather than deal with him, decided to send him and a small accompanying Brotherhood force away out east, to investigate the Hoover Dam and the possibility of bringing it back to functionality."
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.2.a:0 "Ultimately, I care for Veronica."
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.2.b:0 "Veronica listens to me, that’s why I respect her."

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.3.t:0 "Children Playing With Bombs"
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.3.d:0 "When Elijah and his newly formed “Mojave Chapter” arrived they were too late! Just one year prior the New California Republic, a republic of whom the Brotherhood has been fighting for over a hundred years had claimed it for themselves. Elijah was furious, likening it to "children playing with a bomb."\n\nWith the Dam under occupation Elijah could do little else besides set up operation at his secondary objective, a power station known as Helios One. There, he would plan for the fall of Oliver and reclamation of the Dam."
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.3.a:0 "I won’t let anyone take what is owed to me."
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.3.b:0 "The Brotherhood will not be slighted."

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.4.t:0 "Trials and Tribulations"
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.4.d:0 "Our conflict with the Mojave Territories is innevitable. Soon enough, political pressure from the NCR Congress will place overwhelming force on General Oliver to launch his assault on HELIOS One. The only way we can even hope to fend off their onslaught is through preparation: a unique dynamic modifier representing the struggle for inititive between the Brotherhood and NCR. When Operation: Sunburst occurs, the current balance of preparation will be set in stone, so we must make sure to be well prepared before the war ever comes!"
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.4.a:0 "We must be nothing if not prepared."
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.4.b:0 "Through Power Armour alone will we win victory!"

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.6.d:0 "Today is a glorious day for the Brotherhood of Steel, Elder Elijah revealing his tactical prowess in his stunning defence of the Mojave Chapter against the tyrannical New California Republic. We have managed to push the republic soldiers to the Mojave Outpost - although the question remains on weather we should continue the advance down the Long 15 into California. If we were to try to assert dominance over this land its likely we would have to face a more coordinated response in turn."
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.6.a:0 "This is our land!"

Thankfully, it seems that he wont be asked to be called to service anytime soon - the Brotherhood not seeming too eager to chase him back into California."

Worryingly it seems that the Brotherhood are chasing him - we will need to muster a army if we are to prevent this chapter of the Brotherhood from launching raids into California directly!"
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.8.a:0 "We will show them!"

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.9.t:0 "Ciphers of the West"
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.9.d:0 "Our expedition finally made it to and have contacted us! There, they were able to fill us in on whom the Ciphers were in actuality. They would explain the groups origins - in how in the weeks following the Great War, a group of scientists and soldiers left the atomic laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico, and wandered north with a band of other survivors, looking for a place of relative safety. They assumed that they were the only 'civilized' people left, since everyone else they encountered attacked them, trying to take their food, water, and clothes. When they discovered one of the ancient pueblos at Mesa Verde, they decided to set up camp there.\nThe group carried only a limited amount of technology with them. The soldiers had pistols and rifles, and the scientists carried one barely working computer, enough parts to build several water makers and a crude wind turbine to power them, several lead-lined boxes containing enriched uranium, and a small supply of medicine. The rest of the band had a variety of miscellaneous gear which most contributed for group use.\nA decade later, the computer began to fail. Fearing that the technology of the Old World would be forever lost, the scientists began painting and carving electronic schematics into the walls of the pit. At the same time, they insisted that science be emphasized when educating the village children so that their descendants would understand how to use the schematics.\nBecause they were steeped in the sciences from a very early age, the villagers tend to use a lot of science terms to express themselves. This occasionally confusing, cryptic way of speaking caused them to be dubbed 'Ciphers' by educated wasteland dwellers who thought they might be speaking in some type of code. The Ciphers merely shrugged and accepted the name.\nAs the years passed, the Ciphers forgot their disciplined, scientific roots and became more concerned with everyday survival rather than meaningless scientific theories. When it comes to electronic devices and weapons, the Ciphers know more about how it works than why it works; 'The symbols say put this and this together, and then this happens. Why? Who knows? As long as the numbers are right, who cares?'\nWith the information secured on the history and relation between us and this group the brotherhood team we have sent out has sent out a dispatch for vertibird retrieval."

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.10.t:0 "The Expedition Turns Up Empty Handed"
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.10.d:0 "It seems that the expedition we have sent wasn't able to find the mythical Ciphers of the West. Still - they were able to get quite a bit of experience during their travels."
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.10.a:0 "Send out a dispatch for retrieval."

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.11.t:0 "Border Skirmish at the Dam"
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.11.d:0 "It seems that after our recent victory at Helios our paladins may have got a bit overzealous.\nAs Elijah made their way to the Dam (of which the NCR denied them access to so foolishly) they learned that there was a skirmish there between the Brotherhood and the eastern slaver horde known as "Caesar's Legion". Our paladins seemed to have no experience fighting such strange foes - their strategy mixing elements of tribal, wastelander and ancient tactics in terrifying fashion.\nIt seems we have some training to do if we are to stand up to such a threat."
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.11.tt:0 "We can improve our tactics against the Legion through training, done from a decision unlocked by the focus §Y"Preparing Against the Legion"§!."

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.12.t:0 "Devil's Brigade Bunker Discovered!"
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.12.d:0 "After a long and expensive search our scout team was finally able to discern the location of the Remnants bunker. With a bit of work we were able to break inside and discover what was within.\nIt is a smaller cache then what was originally thought possible - only five suits, a few guns, quite a bit of circuitry for the facility itself and a Vertibird. The quality and build of the equipment is positively stunning however - so much so that we can use these suits to further our own power armour development!"
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.12.a:0 "Strange how we didn't meet any survivors, perhaps they are all dead?"
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.12.tt:0 "\n§gIts not much, but we also found the old equipment that belonged to these Enclave personnel.§!"

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.13.t:0 "Midnight Science Fiction Theater!"
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.13.d:0 "The Mojave is home to the greatest the old world had to offer, or at least - so Elijah thought.\nRecently, a group of Brotherhood Paladins chasing a group of Jackals near Nipton completely vanished without a trace. When we launched a retrieval mission to recover their equipment we never would have believed what we found next!"
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.13.a:0 "Suspense!"

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.14.t:0 "Midnight Science Fiction Theater!"
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.14.d:0 "It was near the Mojave Drive Inn that we found it.\nWe found a crashed satellite, yet it didn't seem to be of the same make as other derelict space-debris we have found. It displayed a cryptic blue eye through it - almost as if it was a live feed. It took Elijah only a few moments of study - and seeing a few extra paladins blink away in flashes of blue light - that he realized that this machine was a beacon capable of transport. Elijah would bring together a team of Paladins to head towards the Satellite and travel to wherever it was it was taking them."
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.14.a:0 "Surprise!"

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.15.t:0 "Midnight Science Fiction Theater!"
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.15.d:0 "When Elijah stepped through the barrier with the Paladins he would be amazed at what he found on the other side.\nA paradise of technological progress - a Eden of progress. Just looking out of the window of the place we were brought to we can see so much! Sonic emitters, space age alloys, DNA hybridization, force field particle research, Auto-Doc advances in cranial, cardiac, and trauma surgery... the hopes and dreams of a century became realities in the electronic forges of BIG MOUNTAIN.\n\nThe Brotherhood has found their ultimate treasure, all they have to do now is crack it open and see what's inside."

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.16.d:0 "A long-defunct research station, X-22 focused on researching plant life and its military applications. It was here that the spore carrier, Beauveria Mordicana was created, and later transferred to Vault 22. The team that secured control of this facility ended up taking some damage after facing a particular dangerous foe known as "Patient Zero" in the terminal logs.\nWithin X-22 there are some particularly useful breeds of plants that if used in the right way can truly help us in our mission."

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.17.d:0 "Deep within Big Mountain we have found a strange facility - a indoor artificial suburban village - seemingly made for the executives that used to run Big Mountain. While this place has taken some damage over the years it is still remarkably intact all things considered - we can study the wiring and circuitry within the walls of the house to figure out how to construct Pre-War buildings."
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.17.a:0 "Just some old world buildings? Disappointing."

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.18.t:0 "Securing X-13"
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.18.d:0 "The X-13 Facility was a strange one - seemingly built around testing a prototype alternative to the Chinese Stealth Suit. Brotherhood Scouts had to run through a series of increasingly difficult challenges arranged by some sort of artificial intelligence before they were able to secure the facility.\nWe can use the computer data here in order to further our own research!"
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.18.a:0 "At least the data will be put to use."

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.19.t:0 "Securing Y-0"
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.19.d:0 "This facility is notable not for what it has -.. but what it 'once had'.\nThe Y-0 facility is completely destroyed, yet scarce terminal records say that what was conducted here may have been the most important of all. The facility here was researching §Rmolecular assembly§! - the act of turning anything into anything, the alchemist's stone of old world science.\nIt seems that the Big Mountain scientists here were able to accomplish this - but not here. They mentioned that this research was done for one "Fredrick Sinclair", in a place known as the §RSierra Madre§!."

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.20.t:0 "Securing X-8"
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.20.d:0 "...We are not sure why this facility was even made. It seems to just be a giant school made under some sort of ego experiment? After our paladins stormed through the halls they were able to find one thing of note though - a small Cyber dog by the name of Roxie.\nVeronica has taken a particular liking to them."
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.20.a:0 "I am glad she is happy."

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.21.t:0 "Securing X-7"
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.21.d:0 "The X-7 facility is actually just a gigantic artillery gun -.. of which, isn't actually of much use due to the fact that its completely isolated from any real threat. Still - we can take the ammunitions here and convert them into something our troops can use."

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.23.t:0 "Securing X-17"
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.23.d:0 "The X-17 facility is notable for a strange technology within it - the "Trauma Harness".

Here in Big Mountain we have found an ancient Chinese prisoner camp populated by ghoul prisoners still wearing collars on their necks. This technology has always been useful to the brotherhood in weeding out potentially bad recruits.

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.28.d:0 "The Sierra Madre was designed and built by one man, Frederick Sinclair, his last venture a few years before the Great War. The Sierra Madre was intended as a place for guests to reverse their fortunes and "begin again.".\n\n During its construction until the end, it remained a reclusive area. All conveniences were supplied to the inhabitants by unique vending machines capable of using advanced science to assemble materials on the spot and allowed the residents to live in self-sufficiency, even when cut off from the outside world. The goal of the entire enterprise was not only to create a great casino - it was to create the perfect shelter from the nuclear holocaust. Every element of Sierra Madre's functions is to protect its inhabitants.\n\nThe Sierra Madre Casino is more than a mere casino – it is the material testament to one man's inability to let go. Seeing the Great War nearing, Frederick Sinclair, wished to save Vera Keyes, a famous actress and his love, from the looming destruction. To this end, the Sierra Madre Villa and its capstone casino were built. But that was not enough for Sinclair: deep within the basement of the casino, a nearly impenetrable vault was constructed as well, to make sure he and his love could ride out the apocalypse, together.\n\nIt is this vault that Elijah seeks, there - Elijah hopes to find the secrets to the Sierra Madre. The hologram technology, the vending machines, the mysterious red cloud that blankets it to this day. Elijah has been captivated by the Old World, and he isn’t going to let go."

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.29.d:0 ""As the Brotherhood Paladins began to secure the villa outside of the Sierra Madre they faced hostile forces for the first time.\n\nThe sound of creaking metal echoed throughout the villa like a distorted scream. One of the knights looked down at his chest, only to see a ghastly arm protruding from it, wriggling around in the air as if it were trying to grasp more flesh. Twitching violently, it pulled back with otherworldly force, and the knight fell to the ground as he vomited blood inside his own helmet. It stood there, hunched over its kill with arms wide and reaching for the dead man. Suddenly, it twitched in place, letting out a terrible screech and chitter as it turned to face the group.\n\nOnce men, these creatures seemed to have thrived through the use of suits Elijah recalls from Big MT, although their poor design led to the Cloud eventually leaking into their suits and changing them for the worse. It took ages for our paladins to strike down the first of these - extremely durable despite their small figure. Their visors glowed a deep green, like haunted jade, and its green breath streamed out of the filter in waves like smoke.""

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.30.t:0 "Mysteries of the Cloud"
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.30.d:0 "The Cloud is what blankets the sky here. You may smell it in the air, copper and sulphur... burns the lungs and seeps into the skin. The Cloud is an airborne toxin, spewed over the dead city of the Sierra Madre by the air conditioning and climate control systems inside the Sierra Madre Casino & Resort. Over the years, the Cloud has only grown into a massive blood-red fog that blankets the entire Sierra Madre.\n\nWe found a ghoul here, “Dean Domino” - claims to be an expert on the subject. They said that the Cloud wasn't always here. Grew over the years, even without cars or factories to keep it pumping.\n\nCreated as an experiment by the Big MT execs, the Cloud is a product of the Z-43 innovative toxins plant located in the crater. When Frederick Sinclair, the mastermind of the Sierra Madre came to Big MT for technology to purchase, he unwittingly signed a Faustian pact: Apart from holograms and matter  re-combinators, the scientists of Big MT would also place the Cloud at the Sierra Madre, using the casino, villa and its inhabitants as guinea pigs in its experiments. Sinclair likely saw no other way to get the technology he needed, as he was already teetering on the brink of bankruptcy when he started negotiating with the executives. Of course, he was not informed that he would be receiving more than just harmless prototypes\n\nThe cloud, if used right could possibly serve as a great weapon if harnessed, its abilities In how it can be used to preserve other Old World relics - and cleanse them, at the same time makes it perfect for Elijah’s ambitions for the brotherhood."

Dog was crushed by the Master's defeat, and he eventually found his way to the Sierra Madre, where we found him. It should be easy to take advantage of his need for a "master" figure in order to enslave him like a beast - Dog is extremely loyal and will follow the commands issued by his master's voice to the letter, even when it puts him in danger.\n\nIt is ultimately the brotherhood’s duty to use the old world to protect the new, after all."

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.32.d:0 "The Sierra Madre never actually opened its doors and opened to the public - why getting into the actual casino is so difficult. In order for us to get the technology within we will need to trigger the “Gala Event” - a set of pre-existing conditions outside of the Casino around that will cause the doors to open.\n\nWith our paladins prepared, they began to make work trying to trigger this event - fighting off the ghost people around the villa all the while. Eventually, when we stationed one paladin at each end of the vila and had them perform corresponding actions it caused what we were looking for.\n\nA voice could be heard over the intercom as the gates of the Sierra Madre opened.\n\n“Everyone, please may I have your attention -- guests and residents of the Villa alike. I ask you to step outside and look to the night sky, it's the moment you've been waiting for, the reason we're all here. The Gala Event, the grand opening of the Sierra Madre Casino, you are the ones who have made this momentous occasion possible, and for that we thank you. So raise your glass in celebration, let music fill the streets. Fireworks light the sky and promise of new beginnings fill your hearts. No matter what your fortune, no matter what your cares -- let go this night and begin again. I suggest you hurry, though; the gates of Sierra Madre are open but only for a brief time. After that the doors will close for the evening's festivities and won't open again till morning.”"

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.34.t:0 "What Remains"
  nf_mojave_brotherhood.34.d:0 "A notable aspect of the interior of the Sierra Madre is the presence of holograms - ghostly spectres of souls that died the day the bombs fell. Under the name "Hologram Project," they were created in Big MT by the Big MT company at the Z-38 light wave dynamics research facility under license from Fredrick Sinclair. The initial research and development was a success, creating 3-D human figures, including a replica of Sinclair's love, Vera Keyes.\n\nSinclair wanted to take the project one step further: creating holograms with defensive capabilities. Big MT refused due to the cost of such an endeavour. Sinclair then turned to National Electric - a rival company - who signed an exclusive contract with Sinclair to create. Working from technology already developed in Big MT, they succeeded, creating holographic security guards that could patrol restricted areas and attack intruders via laser beams. Due to the intensive energy requirements, holograms were linked with a nearby hologram emitter, only allowing them a limited area of travel.\n\nElijah believes he can rework the energy consumption of the holo-emitters to make them usable outside of the Sierra Madre casino - effectively giving him a army that cannot be hurt or get weary, the ultimate weapon."

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.35.d:0 "Created at Big MT at the Y-0 research centre, the development of the Sierra Madre vending machines was bankrolled by Frederick Sinclair. the devices he commissioned were intended not just as vending machines, but as emergency dispensers supplying food and resources to ration out in the event of a nuclear holocaust.\n\nAlthough Sinclair described them as the means for self-sufficiency for the Madre, others felt that they were a means to ensure that any money spent at the casino would line Sinclair's pockets, especially with the ban on all other vending machines. To his employees, the vending machines felt like a company store: They could barely afford anything with the modest amount of chips they received along with their pay check.\n\nAt the heart of the Sierra Madre Vending Machines is a revolutionary pre-War technology that never achieved much commercial success outside - although had the potential to stop the Great War if it had: The vending machine is a self-contained matter transformation device. It can recreate any item (limited by the templates stored in its memory; emergency codes could be used to unlock additional templates, for medical supplies and other restricted items by using Sierra Madre chips and the alloy they are made from as a battery and source of raw material for the created goods. It can also take certain items and transform them back into Sierra Madre chips.\n\nAs the chips are not some form of nanotech feedstock, but simple alloys of common and fissionable elements (which can be easily manufactured out of common junk), the machines use nuclear fission to process this material not only into tools, but edible food and even prescription chems. The machines demonstrate that civilization was on the cusp of unimaginable prosperity when the bombs fell; a truly great height from which to fall."

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.36.d:0 "Within the Sierra Madre there are several locations which we cannot easily access even after triggering the Gala Event, specific doorways and corridors locked off to us. Elijah would be able to circumvent this through careful application of one of his recent inventions - the Holorifle. His modification of the LAER uses hologram technology from the Y-0 facility as well as National Electric’s weaponized hologram emitters in order to bypass these defences. Seeing the effectiveness of these designs in the Sierra Madre has made Elijah curious of their possible application in the wasteland."

  nf_mojave_brotherhood.38.d:0 "In order to break into the vault at the bottom of the Sierra Madre we will need one last thing. It turns out that the vault was programmed to only open to her voice - something which may prove particularly difficult to obtain considering the degradation of holotapes we have on her singing. As we continued to search the casino for a way into the vault we gradually learned more of Vera Keyes life.\n\nVera Keyes was the stage name of a pre-War starlet for whom Frederick Sinclair built the Sierra Madre. The young starlet made a name for herself in Hollywood for her impeccable beauty and for appearing in a number of poorly-written romances that drew large box office crowds regardless of critical reception. Dean Domino, an old flame of Vera's, introduced her to Sinclair after seeing that she had caught his eye. But things are never simple.\n\n Dean had grown resentful of the other man and decided to take everything from him, and Vera had been coerced to agree to help with his plan because of past history. When she later started to get cold feet, he secured her assistance by blackmailing her with evidence of "indiscretions" and addictions to Med-X and super stimpaks. What he did not know was that the addictions stemmed from her taking the drugs as pain relief, a refuge from a terminal illness. The shame of betraying Sinclair was percolating to the surface of even her public persona.\n\nVera, overcome with guilt, told Sinclair of the plot. Although he had long known of her and Domino's intentions, he had managed to bear that fact. But this knowledge blackened Sinclair's heart, and he turned the vault into a trap for Domino, making it impossible to leave so that he would have an eternity to contemplate his betrayal. Sinclair eventually relented and attempted to return the casino to its original purpose, but this proved impossible - it had been built simply too well. He did what he could and hoped that after the doors to the vault locked, the Sierra Madre Broadcast, the casino's emergency signal, would bring help from the authorities and unlock the vault's treasure - Vera."

The holograms, due to a critical mistake began to massacre the guests as a result of faulty programming, and Vera was trapped in her room, with only one way out. She scrawled her last words, "LET GO", on the wall, and took an overdose of the chem cocktail which had both saved her from and caused so much pain already.\n\nA malfunction with the emergency broadcast, caused by the Gala Event's broadcasting being routed via the emergency announcement system to save money, caused the advertisement for the casino's grand opening to be sent across the airwaves, rather than the intended rescue broadcast. For over two centuries, Vera's voice would act as bait, not for the rescue Sinclair had hoped for, but for potential treasure hunters, luring them to their deaths, urging them to come to the Sierra Madre - a place where they could begin again.\n\nThe earthly remains of Vera can be found in a chair in her suite, still wearing her gala dress. Her last moments were recorded by the security equipment, making the holograms patrolling the area, as well as the hologram in the Villa's fountain, take form after her while playing what appears to be her last words, consisting of a plea to Sinclair to let her go.\n\nThe hologram in Vera Keyes’ room is notable for the fact that it recorded her final words - storing parts of her mind within itself as an impression of her, a memory.\nElijah would be the one to realize that she could be used to open the vault, hacking into the Holo-emitters and enslaving the digital memory, forcing Vera’s last words to come with him to the bottom of the Sierra Madre to open the vault that was meant to protect her."

  nf_mojave.2.d:0 "Common knowledge dictates that the elders of any given society hold the largest wealth of knowledge, and that was truest within the Brotherhood of Steel. Father Elijah had learned a great many things as his life ticked away year after year, and as his youth left him it was replaced with a ravenous desire to reach the unreachable. He had an incurable and deadly disease that had sent many a fool to an early death: Old World Blues. But unlike his peers, Elijah possessed the skills to make his obsession a reality. Two places captivated him with their alluring glow of the bygone era of mankind. Helios One and the Sierra Madre. The former was in his new backyard, within throwing distance of the headquarters of his newly established chapter. Abandoned and unattended for an unknowable amount of time, the seemingly benign solar power plant held a dark secret. Elijah had a hunch that there was more to this place than power generation, and he was determined to lay its secrets bare. His second obsession was a much deeper, more insidious love. He'd heard tales of a forlorn desert jewel: the Sierra Madre. It was a place said to contain riches beyond your imagination, where any wish could be granted. Whether or not he believed these prospector's tales, he knew that the casino and resort was using rare prototype technology. It had its dangers, he was sure, but if he could find it he would crack it open as simply as any safe. As far as Elijah was concerned, nothing was sacred: everything was his to know."

One of the knights looked down at his chest, only to see a ghastly arm protruding from it, wriggling around in the air as if it were trying to grasp more flesh. Twitching violently, it pulled back with supernatural force, and the knight fell to the ground as he vomited blood inside his own helmet. Elijah was forced to watch in horror, him and his surviving followers faced by a creature unlike any other. It stood there, hunched over its kill with arms wide and reaching for the dead man. Suddenly, it twitched in place, letting out a terrible screech and chitter as it turned to face the group. Clad from head to toe in some kind of hazmat suit, its face was nothing more than a gas mask. Its visors glowed a deep green, like haunted jade, and its green breath streamed out of the filter in waves like smoke. The Sierra Madre was not a forgotten dream, or a paradise waiting to be discovered: it was Hell on Earth."

  nf_mojave.4.d:0 "Brotherhood scouts had reported that a group was establishing itself in the Mojave as a distributor of Pre-War weapons. Upon further investigation they turned out to be part of the Van Graff family. Lowlifes like the Van Graffs didn't phase Hardin in the slightest. Their family was a massive organised crime syndicate operating out of Redding in the NCR, and was partly responsible for the NCR's weak expansion north. In Hardin's eyes, it was time they reminded the Mojave that the Brotherhood was still a force to be reckoned with. Their guard stationed outside proved easy enough to deal with. The Brotherhood didn't need to worry about stealth, the moment they turned the corner and saw him standing there, they simply opened fire. The pile of ash and bloody body parts that was left didn't stop them from kicking down the door moments later. As the traders reached for their weapons, the Brotherhood poured into the building as a few of them stood at the sides and fired at the remaining guards. Charging forwards into the building with his men, Hardin launched himself at a guard reaching for a plasma pistol, tackling him into the wall with a loud crack. A few minutes later and the Silver Rush was silent save for the sound of servos moving. Hardin's men began to strip the shop of its valuables, taking everything they could get their hands on. Energy weapons, ammo, armour, salvage: all of it was theirs. A crowd that had formed outside the casino dispersed when the Brotherhood began to leave, with a few of the Kings trailing them until they left Freeside for good. Everybody felt it: the Brotherhood were back."

  nf_mojave.5.d:0 "Brotherhood influence in the Mojave has been waning ever since the NCR began to dedicate more manpower to the area. The NCR is more capable of reinforcing their troops, able to rely on their large supply lines to feed their army. However, they walk a fine line, as supplies stretch thin the deeper into the Mojave they go. Hardin recognised this, and organised a series of raids on NCR bases to disrupt their supply lines. Mojave Outpost was the first to be struck by the Brotherhood. Focusing on causing as much damage to infrastructure as possible, they collapsed one of the buildings in the middle of the battle, in an attempt to hamper NCR reconstruction efforts. The fighting was intense, the mass of troopers moving through the outpost made it difficult to raid, but in the end the Brotherhood left triumphant. Following their success at Mojave Outpost, the Brotherhood moved on to their second target: Camp Golf. Stopping briefly to rest, repair, and heal up at Hidden Valley before continuing to their next raid, the Brotherhood arrived at Camp Golf in the late evening. By this point the NCR was on high alert, having their main supply choke point desecrated had shook them deeply. Before they had time to gather their bearings the Brotherhood launched their assault on Camp Golf, hoping to cripple the NCR's operational capacity for the following months. Lasers scorched the sandbags around the camp, the NCR soldiers falling in droves to the Brotherhood's methodical onslaught of firepower. By the time they reached the main building they'd killed half the occupants and set fire to the camp. Kicking in the door, they dealt with the NCR the way they'd dealt with the Van Graffs - like vermin. Splitting them up, cornering them, splitting their skin with laser fire. Camp Golf smelled of gasoline and burned flesh by the time the sun rose over the horizon."

Of the ten people he'd brought with him, only four remained at his side, but it hadn't been for nothing. The story of the Sierra Madre was a story of ravenous love, jealousy, and ultimately betrayal. How ironic that the woman he'd so desperately wanted to save died in her room? None of it mattered anymore, though. It was a drama 200 years in the making, the pages of its chapters long since written. What interested Elijah more was this vault, its contents, and the contents of the streets above. In time, he would take everything from this place for himself, but he had to prioritise something to start with. The most appealing of the Sierra Madre's miracle technologies were its holograms and its vending machines. The holograms were incredible, almost entirely invulnerable soldiers capable of killing any sort of intruder. One hologram in the right place could become a one man army. On the other hand, the vending machines were a similarly incredible technology. They were capable of creating anything they were programmed to create. They made everything molecularly, fabricating anything the user desired, in return for some useless currency. Seeing as Elijah had already discovered a way to trick the machines, their potential applications seemed limitless."

Established in the Boneyard, within the NCR's border, the manufacturer had expanded to many areas across the wasteland. The NCR is one of their biggest customers, although they only buy quality goods from them for a select number of soldiers. Their weapons are designed from pre-war schematics, making them not only quality, but also incredibly valuable to the Brotherhood. Hardin ordered assaults on their supply caravans travelling through the Mojave, in the hope of crippling the local NCR rangers, making life difficult for the Gun Runners, and gaining high quality weapons for the Brotherhood. As the raids progressed, however, the NCR began sending guards along with the caravans to deter the Brotherhood. Eventually, assaulting each caravan became like assaulting an NCR outpost. The Brotherhood couldn't continue like this. Switching their tactics, Hardin decided a much more drastic course of action was preferable. Amassing his forces for an assault on the Gun Runners' local production facility, the Brotherhood stormed the building and killed everyone inside. Looting any schematics they could find to keep them out of the Gun Runner's hands, they stripped the place clean before leaving."

Elijah was the same as anybody else, once he found out about that old world jewel he was in love. That ravenous desire rooted deep inside of himself was enraptured by the Sierra Madre. He prepared an expedition force to travel with him to the Sierra Madre, ten members of the Brotherhood would journey with him there. They would set out in order to scour the ruins for technology. It was no secret that many a prospector had died exploring the Sierra Madre for salvage, and those who survived spun tales of a city akin to El Dorado.

Mania, like a cancer spreading its roots throughout his body, had taken hold deep inside his heart.

The anguished cries of McNamara were only drowned out by Hardin's bellowing anger, his face red from shouting constantly. They demanded answers. Father Elijah did his best to explain why he'd sacrificed so much for that place. He told them everything he knew about the facility, how its solar power generation was only half of its true purpose.

One of the traders who spoke to Radio New Vegas confided in us that, quote, \"I haven't seen anything like this since Navarro.\" It wasn't just the Mojave Outpost that was targeted however, folks. Soon after the NCR began to hear rumblings that something had gone bad along the I-15, Camp Golf was attacked. By the time the sun had risen in the sky and reinforcements had arrived, it was reportedly too late. The camp was set on fire at some point around midnight, and the main building was supposedly breached around the same time.

It's news time, ladies and gentlemen. Today the NCR released a statement confirming that they'd taken control of Helios One. This was released earlier today, a day after the fighting subsidised. The battle lasted most of yesterday, and saw at least two thousand NCR troops gathered to fight against the Brotherhood forces. Our sources claim the NCR has been preparing this operation for a while, and it seems to have been a success, although both sides suffered heavy losses. The question is now whether such loss of life was worth it. That news was brought to you by The Tops casino. You'll dig us, baby, we're the tops."
