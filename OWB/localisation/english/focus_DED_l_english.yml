  ded_renovations_desc:0 "The Lifeline is full of clutter and rubble. We will have the Deadheads clear out what they can-- with any luck, we'll settle some spatial issues."
  ded_cleaningthemetro:0 "Salvaging Old Lines"
  ded_cleaningthemetro_desc:0 "Not everything made it to its destination when the Lifeline shut down; we can use what we can salvage. Most of it will be junk, but we didn't survive for two centuries by being clueless. We'll find a use."
  ded_restoringpassagewayssouth:0 "Restore the Southern Passages"
  ded_restoringpassagewayssouth_desc:0 "Much of the southern tunnel has suffered from collapse; clearing it will allow us easier navigation through what remains of the Lifeline."
  ded_restoringpassagewaysnorth:0 "Fixing The Northern Passages"
  ded_restoringpassagewaysnorth_desc:0 "The northern sides of the Lifeline seem to have suffered from slight budget cuts-- including some portions where the ventilation isn't functioning properly. If we can restore it and clean up a little, the north will be free for travel."
  ded_reconnecting:0 "Reconnecting the Lifeline"
  ded_reconnecting_desc:0 "Reconnecting a lot of the smaller tunnels in the Lifeline, through mapping teams and clean-up crews, will pay off tenfold. Arranging for both will be simple-- all we must do is let them work."
  ded_internaltrade:0 "Trading Amongst Ourselves"
  ded_internaltrade_desc:0 "The economy isn't exactly flowing down here, but we can change that. Setting up tradelines between the different settlements in the Lifeline will no doubt strengthen relations amongst ourselves, and I'm willing to bet it'd filling our pockets out won't hurt."

  #The Highliners

  ded_reconnectingwiththehighline:0 "Reconnecting with the Highliners"
  ded_reconnectingwiththehighline_desc:0 "The Highliners split off a couple decades ago, all based off a disagreement on safety. They were worried some of the worse elements of the underground were going to break into the Deadline main, and insisted we move locations. You can imagine how some took that. In any case, many of the Highliners were excellent craftsmen-- tailors, shoeshiners, so on so forth. While not the most useful professions these days, many still value them. Pulling them back into the fold will bring a great deal of morale up."
