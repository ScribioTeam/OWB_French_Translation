  PIPBOY_PLUS_MECHANIC_TITLE_CORE_STATES:0 "Coring States Mechanic"
  PIPBOY_PLUS_MECHANIC_TEXT_CORE_STATES:0 "Unlike in the Second World War, the nations of the Wasteland (with some exceptions) are capable of integrating conquerered states into their nation through §YVault-Tec's Coring Mechanic! (TM)§! \n\nTo core a nation, select a state and look at its properties in the bottom left.  There will be an option to core the nation in the top bar.  \n\nFor most countries, coring a state requires a certain amount of political power and for the state to have less then 20% resistance and over 95% compliance.  The amount of political power is based upon The state's population, how many states you have already cored, and the distance to your capital but can not exceed 300.  The §YChildren of Tlaloc§! have a different coring mechanic based upon how much spare energy they have.  This represents the spread of Chico-Net through Mexico like a cancer. Or a sign of progress! Opinions differ."
  PIPBOY_PLUS_MECHANIC_TITLE_RAIDING_SYSTEM:0 "[BRK.GetFlag] Coastal Raiding"
  PIPBOY_PLUS_MECHANIC_TEXT_RAIDING_SYSTEM:0 "[BRK.GetNameWithFlag] has a unique ability to raid its neighbors for factories and military experience. These raids are essentially border wars. So long as the Broken Coast prevails, it will go from strength to strength... but its neighbors will get tired of being raided, eventually."
  PIPBOY_PLUS_MECHANIC_TITLE_FLOWER_WARS:0 "[ITZ.GetFlag][ATE.GetFlag] The Flower Wars"
  PIPBOY_PLUS_MECHANIC_TEXT_FLOWER_WARS:0 "The Flower Wars are a set of decisions unique to §R[ATE.GetNameWithFlag]§! and §R[ITZ.GetNameWithFlag]§! to represent the constant struggle for land between the two Titans of Mesoamerica. \n\nThe Flower Wars operate around two phases. The first, and longest, phase is the period of a §Y\"Ceasefire on the Border\"§!. During this period, both sides are preparing for the next border conflict, but due to the drawn out nature of HOI4's border clashes, mechanically this period serves to ensure the previous clash has finished before the next one begins. If this period ends whilst a border war between the two powers is still active, it will renew again, to prevent multiple border wars occurring and variables being severely affected. \n\nThe next phase is the period of §Y\"Tensions on the Border\"§!. At any point during this brief window, the side with §Yinitiative§! may choose to commit to a border war. §YInitiative§! flips between the two sides in the conflict after each conflict, unless one side owns all three flower war states, in which case this side can't gain the initiative. Regardless of when the side with initiative chose to commit to the border war, the clash will begin when the §Y\"Tensions on the Border\"§! timer expires. As a defender, you can check that the enemy has decided to commit to the clash both through an event prompt when they do, and by hovering over this countdown. Should you fail to commit to the border clash when it is your turn with the initiative, you will face severe consequences! \n\nDuring the actual clash, only the defender's state is at risk, so it's best to commit to an attack even if you're going to lose it. Defenders face a slight penalty in the clashes, to help maintain fluidity in the clashes, so you might actually be able to defeat a slightly superior force. Once the clash is complete, you will receive a standard event telling you the outcome, as well as the effects it has on you."

  PIPBOY_PLUS_MECHANIC_TEXT_RRG_SENATE:0 "[RRG.GetName] is a republic, not a democracy, and its president is chosen by the senate. Mora, Guerra, and Rosado will all compete in the election of 2277 for the presidency, wooing the support of senators to their cause.  This will be done through a series of decisions in the states of the Republic, and progress can be tracked through the [RRG.GEtName] Congress mechanic (available in the drop down menu in the toolbar). Once you have chosen your president you will get the ability to woo members of the Republic's House of Delegates in exchange for favors.  Note that the decisions to wooe senators are visible on the map, as they are map based decisions.  \n\nOnce a leader has been chosen, they will unlock a unique focus tree to either reunite Mexico, crush the Legion, or bring a new light into the darkness.  \n\n §YSi Podemos!§!"
  PIPBOY_PLUS_MECHANIC_TITLE_SCAVENGING:0 "Scavenging"
  PIPBOY_PLUS_MECHANIC_TEXT_SCAVENGING:0 "Scavenging is a mechanic available to all nations of the wasteland. It allows nations to find guns, equipment, robots and even vehicles that they have researched, or to find research bonuses for equipment they have not. There are four categories that can be scavenged for: Equipment, Robots, Vehicles and Old World Tech. Each of these four categories can be scavenged for in four different ways: using standard scavenging parties, power armour groups, motorised search teams and even airplane recognisance. These categories and methods will be broken down below. \n\n§R- Basic Mechanics -§! \nEach nation has their own §YScavenging Efficiency§!, which reflects their aptitude for finding and identifying equipment, as well as reflecting their tactics and the like. This efficiency can be increased by certain technologies, as well as through focus tree or technology tier. Efficiency effects both the kind of things found on a scavenging mission, as well as the quantity of it available. \nDue to limitations within the HOI4 engine, it's not possible to grant equipment that a country doesn't have researched to said country, and as a result finding ‘future' equipment will instead grant slight research bonuses to said technology. \n\n§R- Search Categories -§! \n§YEquipment§!: In this category, you can find various weapons of all qualities, as well as support equipment such as explosives, anti-tank rifles and machine guns. \n§YRobots§!: This category will be unlocked for a country once it has researched the most basic robot tech possible. As with the equipment category, robots of all tiers and makes can be found with the decision, including future ones. \n§YVehicles§!: As with Robots, scavenging for vehicles will become available once a country's first vehicle technology has been researched. It's impossible to find some higher, pre-war tiers of vehicles lying around (they'll have been long since looted), but most other vehicles can be found. \n§YOld World Tech§!: Only available to advanced or Brotherhood nations, scavenging for Old World Tech provides unique bonuses to the nation that finds them for a short time. This category is, however, the most risky of the four – Old World Tech that hasn't yet been discovered is probably well guarded! \n\n§R- Search Types -§! \n§YStandard Scavenging Parties§!: The most basic, and cheapest, search type. Simply send 50 men with some guns out into the wasteland, and hope they come back alive! This type takes the longest, and is amongst the most risky, but if you've got no alternative it's worth the investment. \n§YPower Armour§!: Equipping your search team with power armour is a sure fire way to keep them safe, but won't improve on a mission's speed terribly. This type is a good idea if you're tight on men but not on arms, and will unlock if you research power armour technology. \n§YVehicles§!: Scavengers on bikes or even in cars will be much faster than those without! This type won't improve much on survivability however, as what your scavengers gain in speed, they lose in being a top target for local raider gangs. If you need some equipment fast, this is the type for you. \n§YAircraft§!: Fastest and safest, sending your scavengers in transport aircraft will make sure they find things fast, and get away from danger even faster. If you've got the equipment to facilitate it, scavenging with aircraft is the way to go. \n\n§RPLEASE BE AWARE:§! \nScavenging and its decisions are slated for a total overhaul in 2.1, as their creator (HappyNTH) is not entirely happy with the way they work. Suggestions for improvement are always welcome in the Discord!"
  PIPBOY_PLUS_MECHANIC_TITLE_TECH_LEVELS:0 "Technology Levels"
  PIPBOY_PLUS_MECHANIC_TEXT_TECH_LEVELS:0 "In OWB certain countries start with certain levels of technology, found in the "Tech Level" tech tab. A country can only research technologies of which they have corresponding tech levels in - for example, as Troll Warren - with a level 1 in Infantry Equipment you can't research Pulse Energy Weapons, which are a Tier 3 weapon.\nSome nations can gain tech levels mid-campaign through effects, in addition you can also enable a game rule to allow the advancement of technology levels for the player."

  PIPBOY_PLUS_MECHANIC_TITLE_REFUGEES_EXODUS:0 "§OProject Exodus§!: Refugees"
  PIPBOY_PLUS_MECHANIC_TEXT_REFUGEES_EXODUS:0 "§OProject Exodus§!, at its core, seeks to represent the spread of refugees across the Wasteland following the conquest of states. By doing so, the Project both provides a realistic snapshot of population movement, and acts as an effective anti-snowball mechanism to make nations bordering rapid expansionists grow. \n\nWhile the background calculations of §OProject Exodus§! are somewhat complicated, the overarching system is relatively simple and works in the following steps: \n1. When a state changes controller (through war, peace conference or otherwise), §OProject Exodus§! is triggered, and begins by calculating the §Yrefugee proportion§! that will be fleeing the state. This calculation depends on two key variables: §Yoccupier appeal§!, §Ypopulation nomadicity§!. \n2. Once a proportion of the local population is calculated, valid targets for these refugees are determined. These are §Yany neighboring nation§! of either the §Yold§! or §Ynew§! controller of the state, with a few other edge-cases rolled in. \n3. For each valid target nation, a §Ynational appeal§! is determined based on dynamic modifiers, the nation's government type, and its acceptance of the fleeing population's race (e.g. few ghouls will flee to a nation that has banned them). \n4. §YRefugees§!, §Yarms factories§!, and §Ycivilian factories§! are §Rremoved§! from the old state, and reallocated to each valid target nation proportional to that nation's §Ynational appeal§! as compared to the total appeal of all valid targets. \n5. Any §Yarms factories§! or §!civilian factories§! reallocated to a nation are added to a random core state within the nation, while §Yrefugees§! join the nation's §YUnassimilated Refugee Pool§!. \n6. Every 28 days, every nation with §YUnassimilated Refugees§! will §Gassimilate§! a portion of them depending on their (aptly named) §Yassimilation portion§!. This portion can be increased by §YCommunication Technologies§!, §YOutsider Recruitment Laws§!, and some assorted §YNational Spirits§!."

  PIPBOY_PLUS_MECHANIC_TITLE_ACHIEVEMENTS:0 "Achievements"
  PIPBOY_PLUS_MECHANIC_TEXT_ACHIEVEMENTS:0 "§YGeneral Information§! \nBecause vanilla achievements neither work with Old World Blues enabled nor would they fit the Fallout scenario, the mod includes custom achievements. \n§OUnlocked achievements do not carry over to other save games, they are completely locked to your save game file.§! However, there is an option to print completed achievements to the game log file. \n\n§YHow can I enable them?§! \nThe custom achievements are enabled by default, when you start a new game. If you wish to disable them though, you can do that in the game rules before starting the game. \n\n§YWhere can I find the achievements in-game?§! \nJust like the vanilla achievements, you can access the window, in which they are listed, by clicking on the button on the top right. \n\n\n\n\n\n£pipboy_plus_achievement_button_hint£ \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn that window you can see all available achievements and check their requirements. \nWhen you complete an achievement, you will also get a pop up similar to the steam one in the bottom left corner. \n\n§YHow do the achievements work?§! \nEach achievement has a requirement that has to be met for it to be available to be earned. All achievements of which you fulfill this requirement can be earned in your game, the other ones have a red §RX§! on top of their image. \nAdditionally each achievements has another requirement, the condition you need to fulfill to earn it. When you fulfill that, you get a small pop up in the bottom left corner after some time unlocking the achievement. The time depends on what you set as achievement check time in the achievement window. \nThe achievements are organized into four different difficulties: §Geasy§!, §Ynormal§!, §Ohard§! and §Rimpossible§!. The difficulty of each achievement is indicated by the small colored icon with one to four stars in the bottom left corner of the achievement's image. \n\n§YWhat is the achievement check time exactly?§! \nTo allow unlocking achievements automatically without pressing a button, the game has to check the conditions of every available achievement from time to time. The achievement check time defines in what time span that is supposed to happen. By default that is set to one day, which means that the game will check each achievement's unlock condition daily for every human player. \nAlthough this shouldn't be that performance heavy, increasing the achievement check time is an option we give to make it possible to enlarge the time span and thus decreasing possible performance impacts. \n\n§YHow does the achievement menu work?§! \nIn the achievement window there is a small button with an orange gear on it. Clicking that will open a menu that allows to sort and hide specific achievements. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n£pipboy_plus_achievement_settings_button_hint£ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe specific buttons fulfill the tasks of hiding/showing unavailable achievements, so the ones with the red §RX§!; sorting the list with unlocked achievements at the top or at the bottom; hiding/showing completed achievements, as well as printing what achievements you unlocked to the game.log file (which can be found in §g.../Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/logs§!); showing manually hidden achievements; hiding/showing the difficulty icon and sorting the list ascending/descending after the achievements' difficulty. \nThe option to show manually hidden achievements refers to the small §YX§! button on the top right corner of each achievement entry in the list. With that button, you can hide the specific achievement manually. \n\n§YDo achievements only work for countries that were human controlled at the start?§! \nAt the start of the game, every country that is controlled by a human player gets access to the achievement window and the list of achievements in there. If for some reason a country that was previously AI controlled becomes controlled by a human player, e.g. if somebody joins an already on-going multiplayer game, he will also gain access to the achievement window. However, to be able to see the list of achievements there, he has to press the button with the yellow gear on it, right next to the achievement menu button. \n\n\n\n\n\n£pipboy_plus_achievement_second_settings_button_hint£\n\n\n\n"

  PIPBOY_SLAVERY_TITLE_MECHANICS:0 "Slavery"
  PIPBOY_PLUS_MECHANIC_SLAVERY:0 "Love it or hate it (especially if you're a slave), §Rslavery§! is a feature of the Wasteland. \n\nSlavery is a new feature in 2.1, and is based upon your slavery law. Slavery ranges from the indentured servitude of [VLT.GetNamewithFlag] to the chain gangs of [CES.GetNamewithFlag]. Depending on which slavery law you pass, you will earn a certain number of slaves a month at the cost of hits to stability. Further slaves can be gained through §Rconquest§!. \n\nOnce a month, the game will calculate how many slaves your empire has. Depending on the number of slaves, you will gain increasing boosts to production efficiency, construction speed, and research through the idea §YSlave Production§!. The number of slaves will be capped at 1000."
