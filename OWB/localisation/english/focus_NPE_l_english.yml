  npe_elves:0 "Senator's Elves"
  npe_elves_desc:0 "Senator's Elves are a bit different from the merry elves Claus once had, but fittingly for an apocalyptic Christmas, they can make presents just as easily as they can rip spinal chords out the back of raiders."
  npe_speech:0 "A Christmas Miracle"

  npe_pact:0 "Senator's Little Helpers"
  npe_pact_desc:0 "Mr. Claus no longer has a Mrs. Claus thanks to the war, but in her place by his side, a council of jolly men and women has formed to support his efforts. The Senator has become the linchpin to bind together the many disparate groups of the north in harmony!"
  npe_naughty:0 "The Naughtiest of Neighbours"
  npe_naughty_desc:0 "Despite the cheer and joy spread by the Senator, some of the less-than-jolly fellows in the north refuse to join in on the fun. After much consideration, Senator Claus has decided to teach these so called "pirates" a lesson in how to be nice!"

  npe_turboelves_desc:0 "Despite extensive repairs, the productivity of Senator's Workshop still isn't meeting Mr. Claus' expectations.

A steady stream of performance enhancers should keep everything running smoothly."
  npe_secondworkshop:0 "More Tools, More Toys"
  npe_secondworkshop_desc:0 "Productivity still needs to increase, and thus, rather than impact the bottom line by giving his elves jet, Senator Claus has decided to set up a second workshop in the far north.
