   ver_opening.1.d:0 "Though Aberhart is held as the origin of our movement to liberation, and it is right that he is, our true path to what we would become began with the merger of the two main political forces in Alberta in 1951.  The Social Commonwealth was born out of both the old CCF and the members of the SoCreds willing to hold to Aberhart's distributist philosophy.   It may have seemed a suicidal split, but the gamble paid off, the policies were more popular than the name.  Over the decades to follow until the Annexation, even through the years of the Supremacy Acts, the SoComs remained the unending governing body of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Even now in the far flung future the effects of their great efforts remain."

   ver_opening.2.t:0 "Memories of the Fallen Martyr Comrades"
   ver_opening.2.d:0 "Several figures stand out among the years from the dawn of the 21st Century to the end of the world for our history.  Daniel Shepard was the first nationally elected leader of the SoComs to achieve the position of Prime Minister, which was taken by American Assassination within days. \n\n  Elaine Bokovay was the leader of the Albertan SoComs for 31 years between 2041 and 2072, succeeding at maintaining some semblance of living standards for those in the occupied territories and fighting for removal and legal actions wherever possible against American actors.  She died of suspicious circumstances the day before the Annexation vote, and it was this along with the Annexation itself that lead directly to the formation of the CPF. \n\n  A sadly unknown Chinese student, name long lost to history, lead the first group into their deaths against a cadre of American soldiers beating an elderly civilian.   His actions caught fire to the city, and the event that revealed the CPF to the world, the Redmond uprising, began.  \n\n  A more mythical personage, a probable mix of several people given the dates, is the Immortal Soldier.   Acting against reprisals in the earliest riots of 2018 following Shepard's assasination, to being the death of American occupying officers and evading punishment only to disappear years later, all the way to being said to have fought in the liberation of Winnipeg in the day before the Great War.   While it is clear with any sober thought that this is a general mythology of sympathetic members of the Canadian Army, the idea of the Immortal Soldier has stayed a constant, even all these centuries later.   \n\n One of these historical figures holds a very amplified part of our culture to this day."

   ver_opening.3.t:0 "Righteous Separation"
   ver_opening.3.d:0 "The long stagnation of the CPF came to it's head 50 years ago, when an entire army group mutinied due to lack of food.  They would go on to found what we now call the Commonwealth Remnants, flying the flag of the American Empire in a seeming mockery of everything we had all fought for.  The CPF's old guard took this opportunity not to attempt to remedy the issues which had led to this, but instead to try and cut down on any autonomy within the regions at all.  \n\nA chance wrong word while removing a local governor of a largely Cree town set the fuse, and soon several towns were announcing secession with them.   The CPF was not about to take this lightly, but the Commonwealth's presence on their southern border led to them just comitting petty arson on the border and fleeing back to Redmond.  \n\nIn the years following we would secede as well, and the Iron Confederacy would stand alongside us to persuade the CPF it was not worth the bloodshed to bring us back.   In the three decades since, we have shared much with our friends to the north, and developed their industry along with our own to keep the defense strong."

   ver_opening.4.d:0 "Just a year ago, as the fears of war were reaching a peak yet again, we welcomed back a face we thought never to see again.  Domina Jure, long departed from the CPF back in 2093, has traveled huge swathes of this new world in the two centuries since, though what little we had to know of it was in distant rumors.  \n\nThe Wainwright Garrison was finally willing to formalize our union, with her at the head, and she accepted the position upon being brought up to date on the state of the CPF. Over the months as she has attempted to bring the people together, some tales of her time abroad have come out, though one has been more pronounced in her training than others."

   ver_opening.10.d:0 "A short year ago, the formalization of the Vermilion-Wainwright People's Union was made.   What had been two entities acting in near perfect concert for nearly 30 years had now been made official.  This came with a lot of issues that now had to be hammered out, however, both in merging the production bases of the two, one a former satellite of Strathcommune, the other a herald of the old CARMA distributed grid, maintained since before the Great War. \n\nThe armies, as well, were not a perfect fit.  Vermilion had long relied on militia with elected officers, and the effective detente brought on by the circle of hostilities surrounding their only real threat. \n\nWainwright was an old CFB training base the CPF had made much use of in the Red Leaf Revolution as well as after the Great War, and has a long history of military servicemen through it's halls.  Jure's leadership has been effective at getting these two to slot together as needed, but work remains yet to be done. \n\n§RWork on Vermilion's issues is quick while you are at peace.  Balance what perks you try to reach for while not overreaching and being stuck with huge penalties for a potential future catastrophe!§!"
