  nf_vault_city.1.t:0 "The All Clear"
  nf_vault_city.1.d:0 "There is a great deal of debate as to exactly when we first left Vault 8, but surely as the leader of Vault City you have access to this information. How long did our ancestors wait for the All Clear?"
  nf_vault_city.1.a:0 "70 years after the fall."
  nf_vault_city.1.b:0 "100 years after the fall."
  nf_vault_city.1.c:0 "120 years after the fall."

  nf_vault_city.2.t:0 "Crime Epidemic"
  nf_vault_city.2.d:0 "When our ancestors emerged from their underground home and built our glorious city with their G.E.C.K., the surviving vestiges of man were drawn to its brilliance. With them came thieves, bruisers, drug dealers, and all other sorts of riff raff. With crime on the rise, how did we ever survive?"
  nf_vault_city.2.a:0 "Punish crime with servitude to the citizenry."
  nf_vault_city.2.b:0 "Enslave criminals for use as labour."
  nf_vault_city.2.c:0 "Give them mandatory military service."
  nf_vault_city.2.e:0 "Give them the Death Penalty."

  nf_vault_city.3.t:0 "Stocked Armouries"
  nf_vault_city.3.d:0 "The defence of our utopia must never cease, as we are a beacon of culture and technology. When Vault Security took stock of the contents of their armouries, what did they find?"
  nf_vault_city.3.a:0 "Firearms."
  nf_vault_city.3.b:0 "Lasers."
  nf_vault_city.3.c:0 "Robots."

  nf_vault_city.4.t:0 "The Gecko Uprising"
  nf_vault_city.4.d:0 "After decades of discrimination and violence, the ghouls of Gecko finally had enough. They armed themselves and aimed to take our Utopia. The villainous Brain pulled the strings from the shadows, causing slight after slight between the two towns. Security Chief Wallace suggested that they declare martial law, while First Citizen Lynette urges cool heads and diplomacy. Just as they come to their decision, Brain's mutant mole rats emerge from their burrows under the courtyard. What happened next?"
  nf_vault_city.4.a:0 "Diplomacy Prevailed."
  nf_vault_city.4.b:0 "Martial law was declared."
  nf_vault_city.4.c:0 "The Ghouls took over."
  nf_vault_city.4.e:0 "The Beasts destroyed us all."

  nf_vault_city.5.t:0 "Future of the Servants?"
  nf_vault_city.5.d:0 "The Servants within Vault City have been abused for many decades now, and some are saying that they've had enough of it! There will always be replacements, but offering them rights now could instill a sense of loyalty that we have lacked up to this time. It's not necessary, and many within the city view the notion of giving into their demands as something far below the Vault City."
  nf_vault_city.5.a:0 "Servant Rights?"
  nf_vault_city.5.b:0 "Servant Regulation."

  nf_vault_city.6.t:0 "Servant Standards?"
  nf_vault_city.6.d:0 "The Workforce that we have been recruiting for decades has by and large been desperate souls, anyone willing to sign those papers and make that deal. Now however, we find ourselves overwhelmed with applications, and in a unique position to demand only skilled labourers. It would reduce the size of our workforce, but it would make the men and women within vault city much happier."
  nf_vault_city.6.a:0 "Skilled Servants?"
  nf_vault_city.6.b:0 "Unskilled servants."

  nf_vault_city.7.t:0 "Servant Work Hours?"
  nf_vault_city.7.d:0 "Our Servants are more than overworked, they are being worked to death. Their life expectancy is at an all-time low, the opposite of what they asked for when they applied for servanthood. This abuse was once overlooked, but these days? Anyone can see at a glance that we're abusing the hopes and dreams of wastelanders. A simple change in policy could reduce the concerns of so many of these people, but then again... what's the opinion of a few wastelanders really worth?"
  nf_vault_city.7.a:0 "Work in shifts."
  nf_vault_city.7.b:0 "Work till you drop."

  nf_vault_city.8.t:0 "Wattz Shipments"
  nf_vault_city.8.d:0 "We've uncovered a store of Wattz 2000 laser carbines in our storage."
  nf_vault_city.8.a:0 "Use them."

  nf_vault_city.9.t:0 "The Thunderbird"
  nf_vault_city.9.d:0 "We have been approached by the leader of the 80s. He offers to end raids on our lands, so long as we give him and his tribe the ability to move freely throughout our lands."
  nf_vault_city.9.a:0 "Accept the deal."
  nf_vault_city.9.b:0 "Reject the offer."

  nf_vault_city.10.t:0 "Thunderbird's Offer"
  nf_vault_city.10.d:0 "Thunderbird offers to pledge himself and his tribe to us if we are ever at war, but wishes to have full control of the stretch of I-80 that we currently control."
  nf_vault_city.10.a:0 "Agree to his terms."
  nf_vault_city.10.b:0 "Reject his terms."

  nf_vault_city.11.t:0 "Storming the Crescent"
  nf_vault_city.11.d:0 "One of our security teams managed to penetrate the heavily defended mountain passes of Crescent Valley. Inside was a beautiful microcosm, with clean air, clean water, and rolling fields of crops. After interrogating a local farmer, it comes clear that his people have no idea that their leader is the bloodthirsty Face Masher. Though he is a terror to the outside world, in this little bubble he is a saviour and a beloved leader."
  nf_vault_city.11.a:0 "We shall decide their fate later."
