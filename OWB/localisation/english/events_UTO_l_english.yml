  uto_decision_events.1.d:0 "A ragtag posse of super mutants under the rule of a deranged nightkin named Tabitha have come to us with an offer. Grant Tabitha control of the Mojave, and she will rule it on our behalf - or we could allow her to fight directly for our forces. How can Tabitha best contribute to the cause?"
  uto_decision_events.1.a:0 "Tabitha will rule the Mojave as our thrall!"
  uto_decision_events.1.b:0 "Tabitha and her super mutants will join our ranks!"

Our dearest mutant friends over in [From.GetName] have finally understood how important the State of Utobitha is, and therefore receive the official Utobitha's stamp of approval!\nTABITHA: Finally!\nRHONDA: If any of our listeners were having doubts about life in the State of Utobitha, rest assured that the International Super Mutant Society has rated it one of the best places to visit on the West Coast! Live your dream life today! Meet us at the mountaintop, see the beautiful vistas, enjoy the adorable centaur safari, and perhaps stay! Say it with me Tabitha...\nTABITHA and RHONDA: Utobitha! Come feel the difference!"
