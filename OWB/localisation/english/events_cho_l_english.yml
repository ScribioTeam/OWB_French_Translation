  nf_event_cho.1.t:0 "The Opening of the Library"
  nf_event_cho.1.d:0 "The library opened the gates on a sunny early afternoon. There were more people than we anticipated waiting at the gates.\nBut that is a good thing.\nWhat is not a good thing are the...less savoury people dispersed among the waiting public. We want the knowledge stored in this building to be enjoyed by as many people as possible, but we can't help but fear that some may abuse what is found within. Maybe we should reconsider our stance? Some form of library pass could work, coupled with a quick questionnaire before handing it out. Just to root out some of the particularly bad folks."
  nf_event_cho.1.a:0 "No, the Library is meant for all."
  nf_event_cho.1.b:0 "It's just some harmless questions."

  nf_event_cho.2.t:0 "A Slightly Different Tale"
  nf_event_cho.2.d:0 "On this evening the Tattooed Man tells the story of the Nameless Choctaw. It is a well known tale among our people. The version that the Tattooed Man tells differs in a very particular way from the most common versions. Instead of an escape from the Osage followed by a fantastical year long journey aided by a wolf, the Tattooed Man describes in vivid detail how the Nameless Choctaw fought against the Osage war band. The warrior fought with reckless abandon, expecting to die that day, overcome by the number of his enemies. Vision blurry from exhaustion and the pain caused by many wounds, the Choctaw finally collapses anticipating a lethal blow to come.\nBut nothing of that sort happens.\nThe Tattooed Man tells of how the nameless warrior awoke the next morning to find himself surrounded by the bodies of the Osage, slain by him in rage.\nStill weary from his fight he makes the trek back to his tribe, only to find the village destroyed by a larger war band of the same Osage tribe in the time he was away. Searching for his loved one in the ruins he finds her body in the burned out husk of her families dwelling.\n\nThe Tattooed Man stands up from his usual seat, finishing the tale rather abruptly. The enraptured listeners plead him to tell what happened to the warrior. He answered briskly 'He started wandering, remaining nameless.'"

  nf_event_cho.3.t:0 "The Results are In"
  nf_event_cho.3.d:0 "We did some tests. Some with catastrophic results. There was an inappropriate amount of exploding heads.\nBut some people following the steps of the pamphlet showed a lot of promise. We got a bunch of minor abilities out of it. Some got precognition, but rarely more than a days worth and usually only inconsequential information like 'You will pet a dog tomorrow. It will bark at you and wag it's tail.\nAlthough, some of the testers were way above the rest. We should decide who to focus on to spend our limited resources on."
