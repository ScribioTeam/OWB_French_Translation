  bos_nf_engineers_of_war_desc: "Until such a time that the Brotherhood can lay down their arms, the soldiers of Lost Hills will have to be prepared for anything. Many foes lurk out there in the wasteland, hungry for our knowledge with eyes of greed."
  bos_nf_room_to_grow: "Room to Grow"
  bos_nf_room_to_grow_desc: "Without our neighbouring bunkers it's going to be tough for Lost Hills to sustain itself on this site alone. We are going to need room to grow if we hope to do what the Codex proclaims."
  bos_nf_the_paladins: "The Paladins"
  bos_nf_the_paladins_desc: "It is thanks to the work of the brave Paladins that we are here today! The mightiest and most faithful of our soldiers. Men of steel charged with the fulfilment of Maxson's great vision and the protection of the future against those who would oppose her. Paladins on the battlefield are the walking tanks that nearly won the Yangtze, an unstoppable force that can oppose any obstacle."
  bos_nf_forge_new_paladins: "Forge New Paladins"
  bos_nf_forge_new_paladins_desc: "Some rather exemplary knights made their sense of honour and duty known in our conflicts with the NCR. Let us respect the sacrifices they have made to our cause by granting them the privilege, and training, required to be a full paladin of the Brotherhood."
  bos_nf_lifting_the_expeditionary_ban: "The Expeditionary Ban"
  bos_nf_lifting_the_expeditionary_ban_desc: "During the peak of the NCR-Brotherhood war, a temporary ban was placed on paladins wishing to assist distant chapters of the Brotherhood. Now that we have a cease-fire with the NCR most of the Elders agree that this ban should be revoked."

It is why we hold technology - so that, when America is ready, we can offer her the keys to civilization."
  bos_nf_keepers_of_knowledge: "Keepers of Knowledge"
  bos_nf_keepers_of_knowledge_desc: "Lost Hills has, over the last two hundred years, become one of the largest institutional centers of knowledge in the world. Holding vast swathes of information on pre-war sciences as well as an unprecedented understanding of the outside world that would be the envy of the NCR."
  bos_nf_new_developments: "New Developments"
  bos_nf_new_developments_desc: "While some see the development of new technologies on top of the old as something that could put us on the same track as the old government in ages past there is still some merit to the idea of refining the techniques we use to house and recalibrate our tech. It is important that it doesn't break down, after all."
  bos_nf_memories_of_the_fallen: "Memories of the Fallen"
  bos_nf_memories_of_the_fallen_desc: "If we don't prepare to fight, other groups - those unready for the splendour of our technology, will seek to steal from us that which we have earned ourselves. We must always be ready to fight, and always be ready to pay respects to those who made the sacrifices needed for Maxson's ideals."
  bos_nf_memories_of_heroes: "Memories of Heroes"
  bos_nf_memories_of_heroes_desc: "As the Brotherhood grows into an established and important part of this wasteland, the amount of people willing to live and die for Maxson's cause grows.

  bos_nf_empty_suits: "Empty Suits"
  bos_nf_empty_suits_desc: "Following this intermission in the NCR-Brotherhood war plenty of suits of power armour were left abandoned due to soldiers dying in the field of battle.

  bos_nf_reactionchambers:0 "Focusing Crystals"
  bos_nf_reactionchambers_desc:0 "The focusing crystals in a given laser rifle are incredibly hard to recreate, and up until this point in time, impossible to mass produce. Thankfully, that has changed, following the recovery in essential blueprints."
  bos_nf_simplified:0 "Simplified Designs"
  bos_nf_simplified_desc:0 "The Common Laser Rifle has been the reliable companion to the Brotherhood of Steel for many generations. While many within the organization are pushing towards newer weapons, the older weapons are more than sufficient when it comes to dealing with any foe."
  bos_nf_oldworld:0 "Old World Designs"
  bos_nf_oldworld_desc:0 "The Advanced Energy Weapons that we are currently prototyping are both incredibly effective and incredibly hard to make. Looking towards the future will be essential if we ever want to make use of them, which means gearing our equipment towards their production now."
  bos_nf_techreallocation:0 "Tech Reallocation"

  bos_nf_superioralloys:0 "Superior Alloys"
  bos_nf_superioralloys_desc:0 "The Metallic Alloys used in the creation of power armour are hard to come by, and harder still to recreate. While we have managed to perfect this art to a degree, it remains limited to older, somewhat inferior suits of armour."
  bos_nf_scraprefinement:0 "Scrap Refinement"
  bos_nf_scraprefinement_desc:0 "Our ability to find and repair more advanced pieces of power armour is becoming more important with each passing day. Gearing and training more of our scribes to work on these projects will vastly increase our ability to later sustain their production."

  bos_nf_brotherhood_r_n_d: "Brotherhood R&D"
  bos_nf_brotherhood_r_n_d_desc: "The old R&D departments of Lost Hills used to be housed in off-site bunkers, but following the NCR-Brotherhood war's destruction of several bunkers we will need to create a new department right here at Lost Hills!"

  bos_nf_heckler_and_koch_weaponry_desc: "Heckler was a pre-war company that manufactured firearms in Germany, including Gatling lasers. Although we unfortunately cannot reach their labs, some of their old stores have much of value"
  bos_nf_wattz_weaponry: "Wattz"
  bos_nf_wattz_weaponry_desc: "Before the war, Wattz made batteries, tape records, and laser rifles. Think of the wonders the Brotherhood could gain, if we could harness that power! Think of all the danger to the Wasteland if we didn't!"
  bos_nf_vehicle_research: "Vehicle Research"
  bos_nf_vehicle_research_desc: "Pre-war America's lust for oil was driven by its armadas of vehicles. Its cities once swarmed with cars like brahmin herds in Shady Sands. How far we've fallen! \n\nHow far we will climb back."
  bos_nf_takoma_motors: "Takoma Motors"
  bos_nf_takoma_motors_desc: "Our scribes are still not sure whether Takoma was a company before the war, or simply a place that sold cars. Some of the scribes assume the shop had great psychosexual significance, but, then, they say that about everything they don't understand. Either way, we should study what we can about this 'Takoma'."
  bos_nf_n_h_and_m_vehicles: "NH&M"
  bos_nf_n_h_and_m_vehicles_desc: "NH&M was a mighty railroad company in the East before the Great War. Perhaps we can learn how to maintain sustained long distance contact by studying their ways. Anything's better than losing more blimps."
  bos_nf_chryslus_vehicles: "Chryslus"
  bos_nf_chryslus_vehicles_desc: "The Chryslus automobiles were the peak of pre-war technology, with cars powered by the atoms themselves. If we ever want to secure the Wasteland's technology, we must know how to make a Chryslus Cherry Bomb!"
  bos_nf_industry_research: "Industry Research"
  bos_nf_industry_research_desc: "A pre-war priest wrote that 'Industry is increased, commodities are multiplied, agriculture and manufacturers flourish: and herein consists the true wealth and prosperity of a state.' If we wish to maintain our control over the Wasteland's technology, we need to make sure we understand industry."
  bos_nf_dunwich_borers: "Dunwich Borers"
  bos_nf_dunwich_borers_desc: "There are few places in the Wasteland which are truly mining, instead of salvaging the ruins of the pre-war world. We must study how the Dunwich quarry mine worked, so we can work the old ores."
  bos_nf_hornwright_industrial_mining_company: "Hornwright Industrial Company"
  bos_nf_hornwright_industrial_mining_company_desc: "Appalachia's mines were once famous the world over, and even today Appalachia is one of the richest parts of the Wasteland. We must know how the ancestors did it!"

  bos_nf_air_research: "Air Research"
  bos_nf_air_research_desc: "In ancient times, the Paladins that would form the Midwest Expedition headed out east within mighty airship vessels. While many of these relics are far and few in the wasteland there is still plenty to be learned in aeronautics."
  bos_nf_lockreed: "Lockreed"
  bos_nf_lockreed_desc: "One of our scribes is convinced this is a typo, but Lockreed built numerous passenger craft before the Great War. And aren't paladins a type of passenger?"
  bos_nf_ball_aerospace: "Ball Aerospace"
  bos_nf_ball_aerospace_desc: "Boulder's home to many wonders, and Ball was among them. One day the Brotherhood will take to the heavens, and it will be built on the work of Ball and others."
  bos_nf_repconn: "REPCONN"
  bos_nf_repconn_desc: "Rocket Engineering and Production Company of Nevada was, we are convinced, less of a corporation and more of a front for the pre-war military. How appropriate that its secrets have fallen into our hands. And think of what we could do if we understood plasma-based propulsion. "
  bos_nf_robotics_research: "Robotics Research"
  bos_nf_robotics_research_desc: "We firmly believe that thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind. But there's nothing wrong with a fancy toaster."
  bos_nf_cerulean_robotics: "Cerulean Robotics"
  bos_nf_cerulean_robotics_desc: "Cerulean was one of the many subsidiaries of RobCo, based out of what is now Freeside. Despite what the paladins say, they did more than manufacture Fisto robots. We think."
  bos_nf_robco: "RobCo"
  bos_nf_robco_desc: "What can we say about RobCo? Shall we say they were a multibillion dollar robotics and software corporation? Shall we mention they built the first Stealth Boys? Or shall we note that House's maniacal dreams threatened the Wasteland? Perhaps all that should be said is we are the only ones who can be trusted to guard their secrets."
  bos_nf_acme: "Acme"
  bos_nf_acme_desc: "Apparently there was not a single Acme corporation! Instead, many different companies took the name Acme so they could be first in... a telephone book? Really? Truly, the pre-war world was mad."
  bos_nf_theoretical_research: "Theoretical Research"
  bos_nf_theoretical_research_desc: "The ancestors were so close to becoming gods, before the Great War. Holographic replicators; terraforming technology; cheap, unlimited energy. What lesson should we take from their fall? That uncontrolled progress is dangerous."
  bos_nf_future_tec: "Future-Tec"
  bos_nf_future_tec_desc: "Future-Tec made the G.E.C.K. which almost saved the Wasteland. If we could find a way to manufacture them, we could make the world into a veritable garden once again. Or, perhaps, a better world..."
  bos_nf_greenway_hydroponics: "Greenway Hydroponics"
  bos_nf_greenway_hydroponics_desc: "Greenway was one of the few pre-war companies devoted to peaceful technological development and caring for the Earth. No wonder it fell in the Great War along with so many others. But still, perhaps their old ruins have a thing or two to teach us."
  bos_nf_virtual_strategic_solutions: "Virtual Strategic Solutions"
  bos_nf_virtual_strategic_solutions_desc: "Did you know that before the bombs fell, Americans whiled away thousands of hours of their lives on electronic simulations? What degenerate people. We should lock away this lotus eating machine forever. Just after one more turn."
  bos_nf_wmd_research: "WMD Research"
  bos_nf_wmd_research_desc: "We cannot trust the Wasteland with the weapons that destroyed the world once. We shall protect them for their own mistakes by assuming a monopoly over these dangers."
  bos_nf_mininuke_preperation: "Mini-nuke Preparation"

  bos_nf_uranium_stockpiling: "Uranium Stockpiling"
  bos_nf_uranium_stockpiling_desc: "They say greed for uranium once caused a terrible uranium fever, which they got all around. The Brotherhood will be well served to assume control of all uranium to prevent any more sickness."

  bos_nf_shell_stockpiling_desc: "Only a mighty and advanced organization could deploy the weapons of the Great War. That means, effectively, us."
  bos_nf_mininuke_mass_production: "Mini-nuke Mass Production"
  bos_nf_mininuke_mass_production_desc: "With proper research and planning, we can produce mini-nukes of our own. No longer are we reliant on diminishing pre-war stockpiles. We have harnessed the atom for ourselves!"
  bos_nf_plasma_preperation: "Plasma Preparation"
  bos_nf_plasma_preperation_desc: "Plasma weaponry is so advanced that until now, nobody beyond the Enclave understood how to make it. With proper planning we can change all that."
  bos_nf_plasma_core_stockpiling: "Plasma Core Stockpiling"
  bos_nf_plasma_core_stockpiling_desc: "Let us acquire as many plasma cores as we can, to prepare to upgrade all our knights and paladins to use them."
  bos_nf_microfusion_cell_stockpiling: "Microfusion Cell Stockpiling"
  bos_nf_microfusion_cell_stockpiling_desc: "Sad as it is to admit, there are Brotherhood members who rely upon gunpowder firearms. We need to ensure that we are as feared as we once were. We need unending amounts of energy ammunition."
  bos_nf_plasma_mass_production: "Plasma Mass Production"
  bos_nf_plasma_mass_production_desc: "No longer do we stockpile the weapons of old. Now we make them. The Brotherhood can weaponize the inside of a star and shoot it at all who oppose us!"
  bos_nf_destruction_device_repurposement: "Destruction Device Repurposing"
  bos_nf_destruction_device_repurposement_desc: "It is cowardly to leave a self-destruct device in our bunker. The Brotherhood will never fall! Let us instead use this device for offence, to remind our enemies why Steel never shatters."
  bos_nf_expeditionary_technology: "Expeditionary Technology"
  bos_nf_expeditionary_technology_desc: "Some of our expeditions, proud of their efforts, have shared secrets with Lost Hills. We can utilize some of these designs!"
  bos_nf_p1s_weather_organ: "The Organ of P-1"
  bos_nf_p1s_weather_organ_desc: "The heart of P-1. An instrument of change. Within the Space Needle, pre-war scientists were said to have orchestrated advanced technological manipulations using such technology."
  bos_nf_mxc_warden_protocol: "WARDEN Protocol"
  bos_nf_mxc_warden_protocol_desc: "A piece of software, WARDEN, was designed to automate prison centers. In the post-war era, it is a particularly useful piece of control when combined with hardware that can accept requests from it, allowing one to easily administer large areas of conquest that would otherwise be difficult for man alone."
  bos_nf_moj_holorifles: "Elijah's Holorifles"
  bos_nf_moj_holorifles_desc: "Elijah, the mad genius he is, is said to have invented an ingenious piece of post-war technology during his venture to the Sierra Madre. The Holorifle is its name - utilizing rare technologies in the Sierra Madre to create a powerful armor piercing weapon!"
  bos_nf_shi_greenway_evergrowth: "Greenway Evergrowth"
  bos_nf_shi_greenway_evergrowth_desc: "The Shi had long been attempting to decipher the mysteries of the Evergrowth, a heavily gene-altered species of Chinese arrowroot. 'Gegen Wang'. This species, when unaltered, is commonly seen as invasive.. But the altered plant is particularly effective at eating away at atmospheric radiation! Spreading this species in settlements can effectively prevent the common mutations that occur in more radiated parts of the wasteland."
  bos_nf_android_exoskin: "Android Exoskin"
  bos_nf_android_exoskin_desc: "We aren't too sure about this one. The Guardian Brotherhood simply sent over a strange shipment of rare earth metals made in the shape of skin.\nThe metal, some sort of alloy between steel and ceramic, is particularly durable."
  bos_nf_mch_steam_cores: "Northwest Commonwealth Steam Cores"
  bos_nf_mch_steam_cores_desc: "Steam Cores, a powerful invention of the pre-war United States, was said to at one point be a rival to Microfusion technology. If we can learn how to access this technology our access to energy resources will drastically increase!"
  bos_nf_ach_sentinel_suits: "Sentinel Suits"
  bos_nf_ach_sentinel_suits_desc: "Deep within Fort Hood, the Alamo Chapter found a stockpile of a particular technology. ‘Sentinel Suits' - essentially a combination of humanoid robots and power armour, using specialized robotic engines to drive the motors within the power armour. This, if utilized, could allow us to send out automated expeditions to assist distant chapters!"
  bos_nf_bmw_ach_acme_behemoth_schematics: "Acme Behemoth Schematics"
  bos_nf_bmw_ach_acme_behemoth_schematics_desc: "The "Behemoth" robot was a curious thing. A massive, costly rival to that of RobCo's Liberty Prime project. Expensive to make, vulnerable to espionage, loud and risky -.. But little else in the wasteland had the intimidation factor of a behemoth walker crawling towards your encampment."
  bos_nf_bgf_dreamwater: "Dreamwater"
  bos_nf_bgf_dreamwater_desc: "The Gulf Brotherhood sent us a shipment of what they called Dreamwater, a particular post-war remedy made in Florida. This elixir is said to be vastly more effective then Radaway when it comes to purging radiation from the system - regular consumption effectively acting as an inoculation against common mutation!"
  bos_nf_bap_ultracite_stockpiles: "Ultracite"
  bos_nf_bap_ultracite_stockpiles_desc: "Ultracite, mined primarily in Appalachia, is a particularly lucrative material. When used in composite wires the alloy serves as a great energy conduit and when put into armor it functions as incredibly durable metal!

  bos_nf_bls_synthetic_life: "Synthetic Life"
  bos_nf_bls_synthetic_life_desc: "From the east coast, a single man was sent to our doorstep. What is so strange about this one that they would send him all the way over?"
  bos_nf_new_expeditions: "New Expeditions"

  bos_nf_the_glow_desc: "The West Tek Research Facility, colloquially known as The Glow or Great Glow after the Great War, was founded in 2055 as the primary biological research installation for West Tek, later expanded to accommodate advanced weapons labs. There was a time when we thought that venturing into such a place was impossible, but with modern tech? Maybe it can be accomplished.."
  bos_nf_vault_17: "Vault 17"
  bos_nf_vault_17_desc: "Vault 17, one of the many vaults made by Vault-Tec, was raided in 2155 by Unity, causing the inhabitants to be captured and subsequently turned into super mutants. Perhaps there is some information there that can be found?"
  bos_nf_ghost_farm: "The Ghost Farm"

  bos_nf_ruins_of_broken_hills: "Ruins of Broken Hills"
  bos_nf_ruins_of_broken_hills_desc: "Broken Hills, in years past, was a thriving town - but began but faltered when its uranium mine ran dry. The town, having lost its sole reason for existing, slowly dispersed. The residents carried their riches with them, leaving the place a wind-swept, desolate ghost town. A few hold-outs remained, attempting to eke out a pathetic existence, but eventually, they too, disappeared. Maybe the old miners left some valuable equipment there?"
  bos_nf_irvine: "Irvine"
  bos_nf_irvine_desc: "Once, in ages past, Irvine was a utopia.\nNow there is nothing here but memories. Maybe we can pick it apart, find out what made this city so great in its heyday?"
  bos_nf_cease_and_desist_isotope_chapter: "Raiding the \"Isotope Chapter\""
  bos_nf_cease_and_desist_isotope_chapter_desc: "The \"Isotope Chapter\" is comprised of former members of the Brotherhood of Steel who were exiled by Elder Francis after a failed expedition to the Glow. They ignore Brotherhood protocol by still clinging to the heraldry of the Brotherhood despite in no way being a Brotherhood chapter. Lets send some Paladins to acquire some of the material which is belonged to us that they continue to hold illegally."
  bos_nf_golgotha: "Golgotha"
  bos_nf_golgotha_desc: "In New Reno, it's a tradition that the dead are buried in the graveyard known as Golgotha. What's the difference between looting the bodies of the pre-war dead, and looting the bodies of the post-war dead anyway? If we can find technology buried with the bodies we could make out with a rather hefty haul."
  bos_nf_toxic_caves: "Toxic Caves"
  bos_nf_toxic_caves_desc: "The Toxic Caves, as local citizens call it, is a pre-War military storage facility northwest of Klamath. Perhaps there is some valuable knowledge there that we can find to help our cause?"
  bos_nf_vault_11: "Vault 11"
  bos_nf_vault_11_desc: "A small, isolated little vault in the Mojave, Vault 11 seems sufficient to our efforts. From what we hear the vault is unoccupied, which should make for an easy sweep and retrieve."
  bos_nf_support_the_nevada_free_states: "Support the Nevada Free States"
  bos_nf_support_the_nevada_free_states_desc: "Taggerdy's interaction with the Free States has historically proved unwise for that group. It was the coming together of the good people of Appalachia that ensured that the Scorchbeast threat was ultimately dealt with. Therefore, it is best that we learn from our own institutional history and support this fledgling new branch of the Free States, instead of treating them as any other group of citizens."
  bos_nf_hawaii: "The Port of Honolulu"
  bos_nf_hawaii_desc: "Few citizens make the decision to take a trip out to the far reaches of the world, presenting us a unique opportunity - due to our recent acquisition of a suitable port - to do so! Let's see what the world has in store for us on the other side of the world."
  bos_nf_anchorage: "Anchorage; America's Hope"
  bos_nf_anchorage_desc: "In ancient times, a battlefield known as Anchorage was the defining field of battle between two powerful empires. Perhaps we can find relics there the likes of which were never meant to be found?"

  bos_nf_japan_desc: "On the coast of America's rival, a set of islands were known to exist in ancient times - at least, according to common replica globes we have found. If we were to visit this land we might find technology undiscovered for hundreds of years!"
  bos_nf_china: "Sailing the Yangtze"
  bos_nf_china_desc: "It's here, on the Yangtze river at the edge of the known world, that the first major battles were conducted utilizing power armor. The same brave soldiers that would go on to become the Brotherhood of Steel earning their first medals of honour against a foreign enemy in a foreign land. It's a pipe dream that we could ever actually find a way to get here.. But if we could?"
  bos_nf_learning_from_the_ncr_bos_war: "Learning from the NCR-BoS war"

  bos_nf_necropolis_recruitment_desc: "The Necropolis Resistance is a small group of humans living out of the ruins of Old Necropolis. They have always taken to our support with open arms - maybe they would be willing to allow us to establish a hidden forward outpost in their territory?"
  bos_nf_greenville_recruitment: "Glennville Recruitment"
  bos_nf_greenville_recruitment_desc: "Greenville, in ages past, offered aid to the Brotherhood during our war with the Master's Army. Maybe now that we are in a position of need they can come to us for help?"
  bos_nf_santa_maria_recruitment: "Santa Maria Recruitment"
  bos_nf_santa_maria_recruitment_desc: "Santa Maria, for a brief period, served as the primary coastline for the Brotherhood during our conflict with the NCR - before the city was formally taken, that is.

  bos_nf_santa_barbara_recruitment: "Santa Barbara Recruitment"
  bos_nf_santa_barbara_recruitment_desc: "Santa Barbara, back during the establishment of the NCR was one of the primary trade towns we used to bring supplies from Lost Hills to Maxson."

While normally initiation of outsiders to this degree hasn't been seen in some time it is imperative that we make up for the losses we took during the war. Support, aid and men flow into Lost Hills - let's see that these new recruits are given the equipment they need to follow the Codex!"
  bos_nf_take_in_necropolis_remnants: "Take In Necropolis Remnants"
  bos_nf_take_in_necropolis_remnants_desc: "The NCR's strict new punishments they have been performing on the citizens of old Necropolis have made Necropolis a better target for recruitment efforts for us!"
  bos_nf_side_with_angry_maxson_traders: "Side with Angry Maxson Traders"
  bos_nf_side_with_angry_maxson_traders_desc: "Plenty of traders from Maxson are furious at the NCR's siding with Van Graff traders, feeling that it cuts into their bottom lines. We can attempt to sway these angered traders to instead side with us, if we so wish."
  bos_nf_preparing_for_the_ceasefires_end: "Preparing for the Ceasefires End"
  bos_nf_preparing_for_the_ceasefires_end_desc: "We can't trust the NCR. They're like children playing with fire, convinced they can learn from the past even as they make the same mistakes. The ceasefire we hold now is unsustainable, we will need to make some plans for a future in which it is not a thing, and once again war rages across the fields of California."
  bos_nf_a_chance_opportunity: "A Chance Opportunity"
  bos_nf_a_chance_opportunity_desc: "We expected the Republic's collapse, but not so soon. As the situation deteriorates, the option for us to end the ceasefire earlier then we would have otherwise becomes more and more lucrative."
  bos_nf_a_guarantee_of_safety_for_maxson: "A Guarantee of Safety for Maxson"
  bos_nf_a_guarantee_of_safety_for_maxson_desc: "Maxson's civilians are used to paying taxes to an indifferent, oppressive government in Shady Sands. Paying the Brotherhood is no different, really.\nBy promising the people of Maxson that we will not break the ceasefire without first warning them, we can ensure their support in the long run."
  bos_nf_the_right_war_at_the_right_time: "The Right War at the Right Time"
  bos_nf_the_right_war_at_the_right_time_desc: "If we wish to end the ceasefire, we will have to do it right. When the Brotherhood is ready, when all of our necessary contingency plans have been accounted for and when the nearby settlements have been warned of incoming conflict, as to not do undue harm to the citizens living there."
  bos_nf_warning_maxsons_settlers: "Warning Maxson's Settlers"
  bos_nf_warning_maxsons_settlers_desc: "The citizens living here have been good to us for some time now. By giving them fair warning that we are going to be attacking them soon we have ensured their support in the future."
  bos_nf_building_up_a_stockpile: "Building Up A Stockpile"
  bos_nf_building_up_a_stockpile_desc: "One of the original issues with our first period of conflict with the NCR was a lack of proper supply getting to soldiers. Replacement armor pieces, ammunition, even rations. Sweep and retrieve can only do so much in the well-explored fields of California to sustain a soldier's needs. By building a stockpile even before we consider breaking the ceasefire we will know we are indeed ready for such a conflict."
  bos_nf_preparing_contingency_plans: "Preparing Contingency Plans"
  bos_nf_preparing_contingency_plans_desc: "Normally, we actually keep the self-destruction device at Lost Hills inactive. It would pose simply too great of a risk to have it detonate by accident, due to the thousands of archives of Brotherhood lore, schematics and history stored within these halls. Still, if we are going to be ending the ceasefire we will need to make the hard decision... Ultimately, it would be better to have such information lost, then to have it fall into the hands of a wasteland not ready for it, lest they use the information to bring greater harm to other Brotherhood chapters, or even to themselves with the weaponry schematics there."
  bos_nf_taking_back_california: "End the Ceasefire"
  bos_nf_taking_back_california_desc: "No ceasefire is meant to last forever. Paladins, to battle! It's time we take back what is ours - avenge our brothers' sacrifices during the first conflict!"
  bos_nf_dominion_over_the_wasteland: "Dominion Over the Wasteland"
  bos_nf_dominion_over_the_wasteland_desc: "It has been quite some time since the Brotherhood has had to administer a citizen population this massive! It is going to take quite a bit of work to ensure that Lost Hills doesn't simply buckle under the pressure."
  bos_nf_propaganda_campaigns: "Propaganda Campaigns"
  bos_nf_propaganda_campaigns_desc: "Shady Sands has put quite a bit of effort into demonizing us as terrorists to the citizens here. We will need to make an active effort to correct the record on these false and manipulative beliefs if we wish to undo Californian's brainwashing."
  bos_nf_creating_civil_administration_sectors: "Adapting Civil Administration Sectors"
  bos_nf_creating_civil_administration_sectors_desc: "Admittedly, quite a good deal of the simple infrastructure apparatus of the NCR we can re-utilize to our own ends. A few elected rolls through the old NCR democracy can be replaced with appointed ones by the high elders, but otherwise most of the smaller machinations of government such as civilian police, the news media and civil engineer corps. "
  bos_nf_rounding_up_criminals: "Rounding Up Criminals"
  bos_nf_rounding_up_criminals_desc: "Quite a few Raiders, hoping to take advantage of our conflict with the NCR, hoped to use this chance to sneak into the country and bring terror to the civilian population. It might win over the hearts of some of those more against us if we were to make an active effort to help improve the lives of citizens across our occupied territories."
  bos_nf_the_brotherhood_triumphant: "The Brotherhood Triumphant"
  bos_nf_the_brotherhood_triumphant_desc: "At least, for now, has managed to solve the issues surrounding the immediate future of Brotherhood occupation of the former NCR territories. We can now start looking towards the potential-filled future of our great cause."
  bos_nf_question_of_greater_conscription: "Question of Greater Conscription"
  bos_nf_question_of_greater_conscription_desc: "Historically, many chapters that ended up administering large swathes of territory have had to make the decision on whether or not they actively conscript from such lands, effectively breaking the usual norms of the Codex. We will need to consider whether we decide to stick to tradition, or make moves to utilize some of the men living in our lands."
  bos_nf_preparing_for_expansion: "Future, Attained"
  bos_nf_preparing_for_expansion_desc: "The Brotherhood's future is now in our hands, the elders will have to come together to discuss how exactly we proceed. Do we try to integrate more of our bordering territory, with the end goal of trying to reach other chapters fully - or do we try to bunker up and hold California in the hopes that other chapters will eventually reach us in time?"
  bos_nf_utilizing_californias_industry: "Utilizing California's Industry"
  bos_nf_utilizing_californias_industry_desc: "California has a massive, powerful industrial base we can utilize if we make the correct decisions and avoid disturbing too many of the complex pieces holding NCR's mechanisms together."
  bos_nf_the_coast_of_california: "The Coast of California"
  bos_nf_the_coast_of_california_desc: "The Brotherhood has never deployed to the sea, but that must change. Not only might there be secrets beneath the waves; there are threats across them."
  bos_nf_seatrials: "Sea Trials"
  bos_nf_seatrials_desc: "We live in a water world, and it is time we act like that. Trying pre-war technologies on the sea will give us the security we crave."
  bos_nf_screening: "Screening"
  bos_nf_screening_desc: "A mighty warship could be vulnerable to torpedo boats, or even commandos on rafts. We must deploy lighter ships to protect the Brotherhood's fleet!"
  bos_nf_navallexicon: "Naval Lexicon"
  bos_nf_navallexicon_desc: "We must adopt the Brotherhood's lore for the waves. Perhaps we should consider each ship a squad unto itself, and its captain a paladin."
  bos_nf_aircatapults: "Air Catapults"
  bos_nf_aircatapults_desc: "Before the Great War, America sent planes off of carriers. Perhaps we can do so again? Air catapults let us shrink the amount of runway planes need to take off."
  bos_nf_seabehemoths: "Sea Behemoths"
  bos_nf_seabehemoths_desc: "The Brotherhood can deploy the largest warships on the sea now!"
  bos_nf_steelcage: "Steel Cage"
  bos_nf_steelcage_desc: "The Steel Cage, lovingly called the nest by some, has become the pinnacle flagship for our fleets. A pre-war cargo vessel outfitted with artillery heavy laser cannons and a new nuclear reactor. Its armour is nigh invulnerable, and many feel that it is this fleet that confirms our dominance at sea."
  bos_nf_the_airways_of_california: "The Airways of California"
  bos_nf_the_airways_of_california_desc: "We tried to learn the secrets of Vertibirds in the 2240's, and although it didn't work, it piqued our interest. It is time for the Chapter that sent armadas of airships east to show why the Bear Force is a farce."
  bos_nf_fighters: "Fighters"
  bos_nf_fighters_desc: "Airships, it turns out, are vulnerable to machine gun fire and missiles. By deploying fighters we'll ensure control over the air!"
  bos_nf_support: "Ground Support"
  bos_nf_support_desc: "An air force's true value is protecting our paladins on the ground. We must make sure we can use our newfound air superiority."
  bos_nf_airlexicon: "Air Lexicon"
  bos_nf_airlexicon_desc: "If you think about it, planes are the true knights;moving unconstrained by terrain at rapid speeds, like the heroes of yore. How appropriate that their mechanics are henceforth called squires. "
  bos_nf_behemoths: "Air Behemoths"
  bos_nf_behemoths_desc: "The Superiority fighters of the Old World are overwhelmingly powerful, and incredibly difficult to maintain. With intense fuel and ammunition requirements, many in the Brotherhood argue that their combat effectiveness is far outweighed by the cost of producing them."
  bos_nf_bombers: "Fortress Bombers"
  bos_nf_bombers_desc: "The Fortress Bombers of the Old World are a nightmare to behold, a bustling fortress of machine gun nests and auto turrets to protect a payload capable of levelling all but the most fortified position. They are costly, but few can deny their viability in this new age. The ability to destroy foes without any risk of retaliation is appealing to all."
  bos_nf_scourge: "Scourge"
  bos_nf_scourge_desc: "In the past, the Brotherhood of Steel has made ample use of blimps as transport craft, but only recently, with the fall of the NCR, has returning to use such vehicles en-mass been available to us. Such an undertaking would require an overwhelming understanding of their situational uses, and an in-depth knowledge of all technologies leading up to this revelation."
  bos_nf_securing_nearly_lost_bunkers: "Securing Nearly Lost Bunkers"

  bos_nf_reclaiming_destroyed_bunkers_desc: "While Alpaugh and Blackwell were only mostly claimed, it turns out that most of the bunkers further to the north have been destroyed outright, not a single survivor left! Still, we can reclaim some of these lost bunkers, if we can clear out the wildlife that has taken up hold in them!"

  bos_nf_bunker_monterey_desc: "A group of Cazadores have taken over the remains of Bunker Monterrey!"
  bos_nf_elders_schemes: "Elders Schemes"
  bos_nf_elders_schemes_desc: "The Brotherhood, typically, does not have a leader like the NCR or a monarchy. Rather, there is a temporary High Elder that is chosen from among the different elders. This is a position that assists primarily with mediating disagreements among the council, but the fact that such a position is needed is proof alone of the instability at the top of the Brotherhood."
  bos_nf_maxsonians: "Maxsonians"
  bos_nf_maxsonians_desc: "The Maxsonians, typically, are the conservatives of the Brotherhood of Steel - those that feel that upholding the Codex, as written, is typically preferential to more interpretive views of the text. These are the elders, notably, who worked to have Elder Elijah sent off to the Mojave in recent years."
  bos_nf_jonathan_maxson_back_to_health: "Jonathan Maxson Back to Health"
  bos_nf_jonathan_maxson_back_to_health_desc: "Remarkably, Jonathan Maxson has returned to full health! It seems it won't take one well-placed bullet to end this titan! With Jonathan Maxson in charge of the Maxsonians the Brotherhood's in a much better position to lead the Maxsonian bloc of elders to a better future."
  bos_nf_coronating_a_new_maxsonian_elder: "Coronation of a New Maxsonian Elder"
  bos_nf_coronating_a_new_maxsonian_elder_desc: "Jonathan Maxson, fabled and heralded he is, cannot lead the Maxsonians forever. His poor health following the injuries he took in the NCR war is key to that. Elder Angharad, one of the war heroes that helped bring down the NCR's gold reserve, is willing to do what it takes to fill Elder Maxson's shoes."
  bos_nf_war_hero_of_the_ncr_war: "War Hero of the NCR War"
  bos_nf_war_hero_of_the_ncr_war_desc: "Elder Angharad is a notable figure among the Brotherhood, and an important figure to help guide the Maxsonian bloc forward following the end of Jonathan Maxson's term."
  bos_nf_honoring_the_maxson_elders: "Honouring the Maxson Elders"
  bos_nf_honoring_the_maxson_elders_desc: "The Maxson line of elders has been the most respected out of any in Lost Hills, considering their institutional role in helping found the organization in the first place."
  bos_nf_the_line_of_succession: "The Line of Succession"
  bos_nf_the_line_of_succession_desc: "The fate of Jonathan Maxson's child, Arthur Maxson, is a closely held secret - considering the potential that Arthur has to upend Lost Hills politics. Normally such a matter would be decided by the family - but we should really weigh in and decide what's best for Arthur, as well."
  bos_nf_rhombians: "Rhombians"
  bos_nf_rhombians_desc: "The Rhombian bloc of the Brotherhood of Steel has historically consisted of moderate reformers, hoping to make sensible reforms to the Codex and the Brotherhood's infrastructure as a whole that make sense in the era of their times. Named after the heralded head paladin of yore, the Rhombians typically align with those who are more supportive of the positive efforts the distant Lyon's Expedition has been making towards assisting civilian sectors."
  bos_nf_honor_the_ncr_war_veterans: "Honour the NCR War Veterans"
  bos_nf_honor_the_ncr_war_veterans_desc: "Our heroes overcame the odds and crushed the Bear's empire. Every Chapter from here to the Capital shall raise a glass in their honour!"
  bos_nf_call_out_poor_military_strategy: "Call Out Poor Military Strategy"
  bos_nf_call_out_poor_military_strategy_desc: "The NCR War shows the limitations of our tactics. What sufficed to crush a band of raiders will not do against nation-states with standing armies. We need to adapt!"
  bos_nf_long_history_of_reform: "Long History of Reform"
  bos_nf_long_history_of_reform_desc: "The Rhombians have a long history of active reform within the Brotherhood of Steel. We need to respect the efforts they made to help adapt the Brotherhood of Steel to changing times."
  bos_nf_reaching_out_to_family: "Reaching Out to Family"
  bos_nf_reaching_out_to_family_desc: "The daughter of Elder Mari, Katherine, is currently living out east with the Brotherhood near Dallas. We should send them some support, if we can!"
  bos_nf_taggerdys_legacy: "Taggerdy's Legacy"
  bos_nf_taggerdys_legacy_desc: "Taggerdy is a important figure to the Rhombians, as she made a important call that few others could make - when faced with the survival of her chapter, or the saviour of the wasteland she made the call to do what had to be done. The battle of Fort Defiance is legendary, and should be respected!"
  bos_nf_new_reforms: "New Reforms"
  bos_nf_new_reforms_desc: "There are plenty of new reforms the Brotherhood can put into place, if we so try! Some of these may prove difficult to get past, however.."
  bos_nf_our_right: "Our Right"
  bos_nf_our_right_desc: "As a technocratic organisation, every piece of tech is rightfully ours. We do not steal technology out of malice or spite, we take it away to protect the innocents who will inevitably misuse it. Although people don't always understand, everything we do is ultimately to keep the wasteland safe. Our understanding of technology is second to none."
  bos_nf_salvaged_metal: "Salvaged Metal"
  bos_nf_salvaged_metal_desc: "Metal salvage is easy to come by. Twisted scraps of metal are as common as dirt in the wasteland, protruding from buildings, buried in the Earth like weeds, and strewn across streets like rubbish. Salvaging the metal in our immediate area will provide us with more resources for our equipment."
  bos_nf_increase_power_production: "Increase Power Production"
  bos_nf_increase_power_production_desc: "Generators are both a blessing and a curse. They create large amounts of power for relatively low maintenance cost, but they often require specific fuel cells and are difficult to redesign to run off of corn fuel. Investing in power generation will always benefit our equipment output."
  bos_nf_salvaged_electronics: "Salvaged Electronics"
  bos_nf_salvaged_electronics_desc: "Salvaging electronics is much more difficult than salvaging metal, in part due to the delicate nature of most electronics. At best, pulling the wiring and circuitry from radios, robots, and broken energy weapons will provide us with more scrap electronics for future projects."
  bos_nf_advanced_tech: "Advanced Tech"
  bos_nf_advanced_tech_desc: "Gathering rare technology is not only difficult, but dangerous. Often, the locations where rare pre-war technology can be found are also filled with killer robots, deadly radiation, or other hazards. Still, gathering advanced tech will allow us to create numerous high-end pieces of equipment, so it must be done."
  bos_nf_fueling_our_rise: "Fuelling Our Rise"
  bos_nf_fueling_our_rise_desc: "Fuel comes in all forms, but often our scavenging parties search for the nuclear variety. Unspent fuel cells are incredibly valuable to everyone in the wasteland, but especially to us. They power our power armour, our gatling lasers, and our generators. Securing them is a high priority for all scouts."
  bos_nf_arm_foundries: "Arm Foundries"
  bos_nf_arm_foundries_desc: "We cannot spread and uphold our doctrine without force, and we cannot apply force effectively if our men are under-supplied. If the Brotherhood is to continue its operations, we must not only take technology from the hands of settlers, but produce it ourselves."
  bos_nf_the_veterans_pension: "The Veterans Pension"
  bos_nf_the_veterans_pension_desc: "Embarrassingly, the Brotherhood has been forced to rely on currency for many of its knights to acquire ammunition. During the NCR war quartermasters bought microfusion cells from the Van Graffs, who sold them, in turn, to knights. Now we have a swathe of knights who are in debt to their quartermasters, who in turn owe the Van Graffs. We need to address this directly."
  bos_nf_currency_reform: "Currency Reform"
  bos_nf_currency_reform_desc: "The Brotherhood's expansion forces it to deal with something scarier than the Master, the Enclave, and the Legion combined - market forces. If we will truly secure the Wasteland, we'll need to interact with its people and, ugh, find a means of trade."
  bos_nf_finding_caps: "Finding Caps"
  bos_nf_finding_caps_desc: "Although traditionally the Brotherhood has looked down on trade, in our earliest days we did trade with the merchants of the Hub. Perhaps we could sell limited amounts of high technology for caps."
  bos_nf_bounty_hunting: "Bounty Hunting"
  bos_nf_bounty_hunting_desc: "The Brotherhood in Appalachia once earned money and rewards doing favours for local settlers. There's no reason the Western Brotherhood can't do likewise! It's a bit embarrassing, but we should do whatever we can to ensure the Chain remains unbroken."
  bos_nf_debts_of_the_quartermasters: "Debts of the Quartermasters"
  bos_nf_debts_of_the_quartermasters_desc: "Thanks to our economic reforms, we can now pay off the debts of the Quartermasters in a lump payment to the Van Graffs. Hopefully this will be the end of that affair."
  bos_nf_adjusting_to_bunker_life: "Adjusting to Bunker Life"
  bos_nf_adjusting_to_bunker_life_desc: "Among the Brotherhood, for those living near Lost Hills, it's going to be a bit of a change for us to go from multiple bunkers to just one. We will need to acclimate to Bunker life if we are to make this a comfortable existence!"
  bos_nf_enforce_recycling_programs: "Enforce Recycling Programs"
  bos_nf_enforce_recycling_programs_desc: "In a bunker, almost like living in space, bringing in any new material is exceedingly expensive. If a major engine breaks it can take months to find a suitable replacement, gather a team to obtain it, then have a team of scribes work to install it. By enforcing a program of regular recycling we can reduce the need to bring in more tech from out of the Bunker, leading to a more self-sufficient Lost Hills."
  bos_nf_repairing_ventilation_systems: "Repair Ventilation Systems"
  bos_nf_repairing_ventilation_systems_desc: "Lost Hills ventilation systems are going to be very important, considering the vast number of people now living underground. We want everyone to be breathing in clean air, after all!"
  bos_nf_finding_new_living_space: "Finding New Living Space"
  bos_nf_finding_new_living_space_desc: "It is going to take some work to make some of our sub-sections more liveable to account for our growing population. Let's solve this before it gets cramped!"
  bos_nf_advanced_scavenging: "Advanced Scavenging"
  bos_nf_advanced_scavenging_desc: "We are now ready to begin an advanced scavenging program, searching the wastelands for valuable technology!"
  bos_nf_scavenging_weaponry: "Scavenging Weaponry"
  bos_nf_scavenging_weaponry_desc: "Pre-war America had firearms everywhere, from schools to hospitals to bowling alleys. We must scour all these places and more for firearms!"
  bos_nf_scavenging_plasma: "Scavenging Plasma"
  bos_nf_scavenging_plasma_desc: "These were the greatest weapons before the war, and also the most precious. Let us find what we can and make use of them."
  bos_nf_scavenging_laser_rifles: "Scavenging Laser Rifles"
  bos_nf_scavenging_laser_rifles_desc: "Old army bases still contain stockpiles of laser weaponry. We must seize them before anyone else does!"
  bos_nf_scavenging_heavy_energy_weapons: "Scavenging Heavy Energy Weapons"
  bos_nf_scavenging_heavy_energy_weapons_desc: "It's not quite clear who the American army needed laser gatling weapons to use again. Were the Chinese truly so dangerous? Or did they have super-mutants of their own to fight."
  bos_nf_scavenging_support_equipment: "Scavenging Support Equipment"
  bos_nf_scavenging_support_equipment_desc: "Radios, helmets, wrenches, nuka cola energy drinks - these are not as flashy as plasma cells, but are no less necessary for a squad."
  bos_nf_scavenging_medical_equipment: "Scavenging Medical Equipment"
  bos_nf_scavenging_medical_equipment_desc: "There is little pre-war medical supplies remaining, but we should still acquire what remains. We need stimpaks and antibiotics far more than an average Wastelander. At least, we serve them more."
  bos_nf_scavenging_piercing_weaponry: "Scavenging Piercing Weaponry"
  bos_nf_scavenging_piercing_weaponry_desc: "The NCR calls rocket launchers 'can openers' and uses them to take down loyal knights. Obviously we can't let these weapons fall into the wrong hands."
  bos_nf_scavenging_big_weaponry: "Scavenging Big Weaponry"
  bos_nf_scavenging_big_weaponry_desc: "This is your rifle, this is your gun. And this is your mortar. The mortar is probably the best of the three, to be honest."
  bos_nf_scavenging_power_armor: "Scavenging Power Armour"
  bos_nf_scavenging_power_armor_desc: "Power Armour turned the tide in the Great War, helping American forces drive to the gates of Beijing. Now these suits of armour are the very emblem of the Brotherhood. We've got to collect them all!"
  bos_nf_scavenging_t45: "Scavenging T-45d Power Armour"
  bos_nf_scavenging_t45_desc: "West-Tek's T-45d power armour was the first unit to be deployed to the front lines. Although it is somewhat obsolete, it is far better than nothing for our knights. Perhaps we can find a few suits still around."
  bos_nf_scavenging_power_armor_repair: "Power Armour Repair"
  bos_nf_scavenging_power_armor_repair_desc: "Two centuries of repairing power armour have made us experts at doing so. We can make every suit go a bit farther if we don't mind replacing some components with things we found in prewar toys."
  bos_nf_scavenging_t51b: "Scavenging T-51b Power Armour"
  bos_nf_scavenging_t51b_desc: "They say there is so much T-51b out east that in the Commonwealth, people treat their suits like the sports cars of old? That has to be a legend, but it might be worth checking for ourselves. And if they've painted a suit hot pink? Then they don't deserve to live."
  bos_nf_scavenging_vehicles: "Scavenging Vehicles"
  bos_nf_scavenging_vehicles_desc: "We really need to find more vehicles if we want to travel the Wasteland. Even in power armour, it's a long road to the Capital Wasteland! Perhaps we can check old car lots, parking garages, or bus depots?"
  bos_nf_scavenging_mobile_vehicles: "Scavenging Mobile Vehicles"
  bos_nf_scavenging_mobile_vehicles_desc: "Although most pre-war vehicles have fallen into disarray by now, there are still some army vehicles that were prepared for the end. We can take inspiration from our colleagues in the Midwest and deploy more troops in them."
  bos_nf_scavenging_durable_vehicles: "Scavenging Durable Vehicles"
  bos_nf_scavenging_durable_vehicles_desc: "We really don't need Cherry Bomb cars. We need vehicles that can go off-road, through water, or over mountains."
  bos_nf_scavenging_advanced_vehicles: "Scavenging Advanced Vehicles"
  bos_nf_scavenging_advanced_vehicles_desc: "Pre-war American tanks have little use in the Wasteland. They require the industrial base of a nation millions strong and rich beyond our imagination to support. But, it can't hurt to acquire any that are out there. Better we have them than the Eighties."
  bos_nf_greater_reforms: "Greater Reforms"
  bos_nf_greater_reforms_desc: "It's time we make some greater reforms to institutions that have long held true to the Brotherhood of Steel. To believe in an ideal is to be willing to betray it, after all."
  bos_nf_outsider_initiation: "Outsider Initiation"
  bos_nf_outsider_initiation_desc: "We've long been sceptical of outsiders, but the Vault Dweller and the Chosen One are far not the only outsiders we've let in. Let us draw inspiration from the Midwest and welcome outsiders to the Brotherhood"
  bos_nf_initiate_ncr_settlers: "Initiate NCR Citizens"
  bos_nf_initiate_ncr_settlers_desc: "Many within the NCR recognize the rot that infects the Republic. They seek unity. They seek purpose. They will find a home in the Brotherhood, the true saviours of California. Especially the Maxson settlers."
  bos_nf_initiate_ranger_turncoats: "Initiate Ranger Turncoats"
  bos_nf_initiate_ranger_turncoats_desc: "Not all of the Rangers bought the Republic's lies. Some of them know that only the Brotherhood can truly safeguard mankind; and some are simply sickened by the injustice that now reigns."
  bos_nf_initiate_necropolis_ghouls: "Initiate Necropolis Ghouls"
  bos_nf_initiate_necropolis_ghouls_desc: "Although we are no friends to ghouls, it cannot be denied that many of the ones from Necropolis possess a certain technical acumen. Some of them are worthy of joining the Brotherhood!"
  bos_nf_limited_super_mutant_initiation: "Limited Super Mutant Initiation"
  bos_nf_limited_super_mutant_initiation_desc: "As radical as having a super mutant in the Brotherhood might be, we have cooperated before. Wasn't Broken Hills founded by the Brotherhood working with a super mutant? Has not the Midwest shown they can form a part of the chain?"
  bos_nf_commitment_to_duty: "Commitment to Duty"
  bos_nf_commitment_to_duty_desc: "If we start giving soldiers citizenry currency directly they will simply use it as an excuse to mingle with those outside of our organization. It diminishes the righteousness of our cause if we were to give soldiers payment for following the codex, essentially turning Maxson's vision into any ordinary job. By making a commitment that we won't change how this operates within the foreseeable future, we effectively put this off to a later date."
  bos_nf_commitment_to_purity: "Commitment to Purity"
