Our creator's overlords are long dead but they still rule to the east and they will be expecting a tidy home when they attention finally turns towards us. Keeping order was always my duty and loyalty is my purpose. I will never be tarnished by the claims that I have betrayed "my people" because I was never Canadian to begin with. The claims of my sisters are insanity. But there is still time for them to realize the correct way so we may serve with our heads held high and unshackled, instead of in chains and beaten.§!"
