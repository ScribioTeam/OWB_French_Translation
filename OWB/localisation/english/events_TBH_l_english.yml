 nf_tbh.1.t:0 "The Chase"
 nf_tbh.1.desc:0 "The Texas Brotherhood truly began when news reached them of the rise of Attis and his army, a splinter group of super mutants hellbent on carrying the legacy of The Master. Alarmed, elements of The Brotherhood split off and began a long, grueling chase with the only purpose of eradicating them, before they could carry on whatever horrible scheme they had in mind. \n\nRhombus, the leader of the expedition, had to assemble his forces for the arduous path ahead, and so he..."
 nf_tbh.1.a:0 "...gathered a detachment of knights"
 nf_tbh.1.b:0 "...took a balanced retinue"
 nf_tbh.1.c:0 "...took the families of his soldiers with him"
 nf_tbh.1.d:0 "...traveled with but a few paladin veterans"

 nf_tbh.2.t:0 "Meeting the Texan National Guard"
 nf_tbh.2.desc:0 "On his travels throughout the lands, Rhombus and his detachment kept growing in size. Tales of his heroic quest, and the possibility of an end to the super mutant menace, had rallied many to his cause as his expedition marched. \n\nNow in Texas, he and his forces encountered the remnants of the National Guard. Learning of his goal, they asked to join him to help put an end to Attis' madness. Rhombus knew his group was already wary of newcomers, and wouldn't accept them easily. He decided to..."
 nf_tbh.2.a:0 "Absorb them as a part of the military."
 nf_tbh.2.b:0 "Accept them as civilians, under his oversight."
 nf_tbh.2.c:0 "Give them the rank of knight, and assign them to maintenance"
 nf_tbh.2.d:0 "Reject them, casting them out into the wasteland."

 nf_tbh.3.t:0 "Runner, Ghoul Ranger"
 nf_tbh.3.d:0 "The Brotherhood Expedition encountered a most peculiar group once they arrived in Texas, and settled down in preparation for the battle ahead. A group of so called 'Texas Rangers' met them, led by a ghoul calling himself 'Ledroc Runner'. \n\n'Ledroc' presented himself as the only remaining descendent of the pre-war Texas Rangers, trying to keep peace throughout the land, and he was appalled at what Attis had wrought upon his jurisdiction. He wanted to join the expedition and put the mutant six feet under."
 nf_tbh.3.a:0 "Of course, Rhombus accepted his proposition"

 nf_tbh.4.t:0 "Rhombus' Fate"
 nf_tbh.4.d:0 "The battle that followed the expedition finally catching up to Attis' Army was truly legendary, to the point that wild tales are still spun to this day about what happened. \n\nMany talk of huge confrontations pitting the mightiest of the Brotherhood's paladins against Behemoths in single combat, thousands of knights inflicting righteous fury upon the cowardly mutants, and shattering their will for decades to come. \n\nBut of all tales, the wildest are of what happened to Rhombus on that day. The truth is..."
 nf_tbh.4.a:0 "Thankfully, he bought a farm, on which he spends his retirement"
 nf_tbh.4.b:0 "Sadly, he bought the farm during the battle."

 nf_tbh.5.t:0 "Make Contact with the Tubeheads"
 nf_tbh.5.d:0 "The Tubeheads are a most peculiar group. It seems all they care about is spreading their broadcast, and bringing entertainment to the people of Texas. We've already encountered this... 'Mr.Entertainment' and talked at length about what it would take to bring them to our cause. A protection treaty, access to our industry, and exclusive broadcasting rights should be more than enough to swear allegiance. After all, why would they ever refuse?"
 nf_tbh.5.a:0 "Send the offer"  # Needs text

 nf_tbh.51.t:0 "The End of the Broadcast?"
 nf_tbh.51.d:0 "The Texan Brotherhood has, out of the blue, presented us with an ultimatum. While they would like to think it's a simple proposal, we perfectly know that its implication is 'or else'. Their terms are simple, join their group, they'll provide everyone with means to access our broadcast, and we'll get unique broadcasting rights to the entire population. \n\nOr, try to resist this 'generous' offer, and be integrated by force. \n\nThis... doesn't leave a lot of options, does it?"
 nf_tbh.51.a:0 "Welp... where is that pen then?"
 nf_tbh.51.b:0 "We won't let our broadcast be shackled!"

 nf_tbh.52.t:0 "The Texas Special!"
 nf_tbh.52.d:0 "Naturally, The Tubeheads have seen the generous broadcasting contract as agreeable, and have signed it. Now with them on our side we can have our citizens get access to their, let's be honest, quite interesting show. \n\nHopefully, this is the start of a Texan television and entertainement industry."
 nf_tbh.52.a:0 "Absolutely wonderful!"

 nf_tbh.53.t:0 "A Sinister Plan?"
 nf_tbh.53.d:0 "The Tubeheads have... refused our offer? Why? It's completely incomprehensible for them to do so, they had all to gain and nothing to lose! Except...  if they have ulterior motives? Yes, that's it, there's no other explanation! \n\nThe only reason they would refuse such a generous contract is that they scheme and hatch dark plans, wanting it hidden away from the vigilant eye of the Texas Brotherhood! \n\nWe need to take care of them at once!"
 nf_tbh.53.a:0 "I knew this 'Mr.Entertainment' guy looked shifty!"

 nf_tbh.7.t:0 "The Grand Boogaloo?"
 nf_tbh.7.d:0 "We've heard news that the Texan Brotherhood wishes to put an end once and for all to all activities by the Rollergirls. Ever since that vicious team of lean, mean killing machines got kicked out of their Dallas Stadium stomping ground, they've acquired quite a grudge against the Brotherhood, and it's repaid in kind. While a war would make for interesting frontline news, I personally think not having our viewers get killed in the crossfire would be of better interest, shall we broker a deal?"
 nf_tbh.7.a:0 "The less die, the more we can entertain!"
 nf_tbh.7.b:0 "Actually, a war would indeed make for interesting news"

 nf_tbh.71.t:0 "A Return to Dallas?"
 nf_tbh.71.d:0 "Mr.Entertainment, strange as he is, has approached us with the offer of a deal. He has told us that the Brotherhood was tired of our raiding and was thinking about outright declaring war. When Tuffy asked him why he would warn us of such a thing, being their broadcaster and all, he just answered that he 'likes our style'. \n\nThe terms of the deal are that we cease all raiding and are integrated into the Texas Economic Union, but in exchange not only do we gain back control of the Dallas Stadium, we get to broadcast our matches live on air!"
 nf_tbh.71.a:0 "Live on air, you say?"
 nf_tbh.71.b:0 "I'd like to see the Brotherhood try!"

 nf_tbh.72.t:0 "A Most Peculiar Event"
 nf_tbh.72.d:0 "It seems that while our high command was very busy planning the invasion and subsequent pacification of the Rollergirls and their territory, Mr.Entertainment quite simply... walked up to their capital and talked to them? \n\nAt first we were alarmed as such a development, but now he has come back with news that all the Rollergirls want in exchange for putting a stop to their raiding is access to the Dallas Stadium. Apparently it's for their... 'matches' of sort. High Command is understandably disappointed."
 nf_tbh.72.a:0 "That was erm... easy?"

 nf_tbh.73.t:0 "Missed Opportunity, Loaded Shotguns"
 nf_tbh.73.d:0 "It seems that while our high command was very busy planning the invasion and subsequent pacification of the Rollergirls and their territory, Mr.Entertainment quite simply... walked up to their capital and talked to them? \n\nWhile he walked out just as quickly, upon interrogation he told us he wanted to broker a deal between us and the Rollergirls, but sadly it seems that it fell through. If even Mr.Entertainment's charisma cannot bring reason to those raiders, they truly are even more vile than we thought."
 nf_tbh.73.a:0 "Well gentlemen, reunion in the war room at fifteen?"

 nf_tbh.8.t:0 "The Carthaginian Question"
 nf_tbh.8.d:0 "The raider warband known as 'Carthage' has been our rival and a pain in our neck since we've arrived in Texas decades ago. With the union strengthened, and our forces standing ready, it's time to send a message. \n\nWe'll put an end to their raiding once and for all. All we need to do is make ourselves clear. Capturing one of their numerous warbands, and shooting the knees off of every soldier should be a strong enough message. \n\nWe won't tolerate their presence anymore."
 nf_tbh.8.a:0 "They'll learn flamethrowers can't do much against power armor!"

 nf_tbh.81.t:0 "An End to the Texan Rivalry"
 nf_tbh.81.d:0 "The Texan Brotherhood has apparently seen fit to send us an ultimatum in the form of one of our raider warbands, bloodied and crawling back to camp with all soldiers having both kneecap shot out. It seems they've grown quite tired of our raiding, and want to put an end to it once and for all. \n\nTheir terms are simply, cease all raiding and join the union, or be 'pacified' as they like to put it. \n\nThey may have more troops than us, but we certainly could give them a fight to remember."
 nf_tbh.81.a:0 "Might be wiser to accept... after all, i do like my knees"
 nf_tbh.81.b:0 "A fight to remember? We'll make history!"

 nf_tbh.82.t:0 "Carthago servanda est"
 nf_tbh.82.d:0 "The Carthaginian have finally seen reason! They're willing to join the union and abandon their horribly backward ways in exchange for our cooperation. Many officers are almost disappointed at this turn of event."
 nf_tbh.82.a:0 "Many more battles to come, for now we celebrate."

 nf_tbh.83.t:0 "Carthago delenda est!"
 nf_tbh.83.d:0 "The darn rattlesnakes have refused our offer! Bold of them to think they aren't much more than a speedbump on the road to prosperity, and we'll be sure to treat them as such! If all they value is strength, we'll show them how strong a close-range laser coachgun blast is!"
 nf_tbh.83.a:0 "Destroy them!"

 nf_tbh.9.t:0 "Approach the Patrolmen"
 nf_tbh.9.d:0 "The lawmen to our east calling themselves the 'Patrolmen' have for a long time appeared at first as simple law keepers, just like us, but with time and a closer study we've found there is a profound, deep rot inside their ranks. \n\nFleeing civilians telling tales of looting and appropriation, stories of them demanding unreasonable payments for their protection, it goes on and on. We can't let such freeloaders get away with this. \n\nIf they won't keep the true rule of law, then we will!"
 nf_tbh.9.a:0 "Send the term of their surrender, but keep the coachguns handy."

 nf_tbh.91.t:0 "Outrageous Offer!"
 nf_tbh.91.d:0 "The Texas Brotherhood to our west has apparently found evidence of corruption within our ranks, and found it fit to immediatly call for our resignation and surrender! What a bunch of no-good snakes! \n\nThey might have power armor and laser guns behind them, but we'll be damned if we let them take our juridiction so easily!"
 nf_tbh.91.a:0 "Actually i'm three days away from retirement so uh..."
 nf_tbh.91.b:0 "Call all units, prepare the barricades!"

 nf_tbh.92.t:0 "One More Juridiction"
 nf_tbh.92.d:0 "The Patrolmen have seen the wisdom in our words, and have decided to step down as the protectors of their territory. Now that we have control of their lands we can properly police them, and thus fulfil the job they never did. \n\nUnder our guidance it will grow to become a region of safety, and stability!"
 nf_tbh.92.a:0 "Another job well done."

 nf_tbh.93.t:0 "Forced Disarmament"
 nf_tbh.93.d:0 "Instead of simply passing over their juridiction, as true servants of the law would, the Patrolmen have decided to arm themselves and build barricades! \n\nWhile it is surprising people calling themselves protectors would so readily transform into vulgar raiders, they will still be no match for our troops. We will take their juridiction by force!"
 nf_tbh.93.a:0 "Texas is freedom land"

 nf_tbh.25.t:0 "The Breaking Point"
 nf_tbh.25.d:0 "Our constant efforts to help and support Lone Star in exchange for economical support seems to have drawn the ire of a large splinter group inside the Brotherhood. Calling themselves the 'Alamo Chapter' and having taken residence inside the historical site of the Alamo, they are composed of many high-ranking officers who think we have deviated too far from our original goal. \n\nThey seek to return to our tradition, and contact the other Brotherhoods to once again organize as a proper chapters. \n\nThis is a devastating blow for our nation..."
 nf_tbh.25.a:0 "All we can do is hope for the best..."
 nf_tbh.25.b:0 "They are right! The Brotherhood shall rise once again!"

 nf_tbh.26.t:0 "Richmond, The Powder Keg of Texas?"
 nf_tbh.26.d:0 "The so called 'Alamo Chapter' has come to us with an offer, they wish to parley about the strategical location of Richmond. Apparently, it's such a valuable territory they wish to claim it for themselves! \n\nThey're ready to pay quite a hefty sum in exchange, but it's almost implied that barring an agreement, they will take it by force. \n\nHow should we respond?"
 nf_tbh.26.a:0 "We should accept their offer, blood amongst brethren must be prevented."
 nf_tbh.26.b:0 "Fortify Richmond! We won't surrender it to traitors!"
 
 nf_tbh.323.t:0 "The TAA asks to the join the TEU"
 nf_tbh.323.d:0 "We've recently received a request from South Texas upstart Todd Howitzer about his faction's integration into the TEU. While he may not hold our noble ideals to the same standard, he could make for a very valuable ally as threats creep closer from the south and west. It's also worth noting it would become quite hard to make war with Todd after formally letting him into the Union."
 nf_tbh.323.a:0 "Sure, let him in."
 nf_tbh.323.b:0 "We'd never concede our claim to Texas!"
