  nautics_tech_1:0 "Seafaring"
  nautics_tech_1_desc:0 "As annoying as it may be for our crew, oars seems to be the best way to move our future crafts as of now, and insure our capability to field a navy. Discipline training and higher physical requirements should be prioritized during recruiting, and so should a particularly high opinion of the commanding officer. Unruly elements should not be sent to oar duty, for very obvious reasons."
  nautics_tech_2:0 "Sail Navigation"
  nautics_tech_2_desc:0 "Textile production and rigging engineering will be done on the double, as our oars crew have many time stressed that they will not continue their duty for much longer. This gives us the possibility to use the wind and sails to assist them, making them less likely to start a mutiny, and saving precious ammo in return."
  nautics_tech_3:0 "Paddlewheels"
  nautics_tech_3_desc:0 "Steam engines, including transmission, paddlewheels propulsion devices, and secured boiler systems, will considerably increase the speed of our ships as we do not have needs for natural elements anymore. Advanced training is to be given in safety during engineering operations, as well as stress shock resistance training to avoid them soiling their underwear every time the hull takes a hit around the engine room."
  nautics_tech_4:0 "Subsurface Propulsion"
  nautics_tech_4_desc:0 "Water-resistant and lightweight alloy is under study to equip our crafts with advanced subsurface propulsion systems. Direct transmission from the engine room to the propulsion units, along with advanced steam powerpacks and increased propeller diameter, will make our vessels even more swift and give us tactical as well as strategical advantages."
  nautics_tech_5:0 "Nuclear Hydrojet"
  nautics_tech_5_desc:0 "Research and development into miniaturized nuclear technology, derived from terrestrial research and experimental reactors, and powering a pump-jet propeller, is the most advanced propulsion system we could ever give to our ships. A sodium-cooled fast reactor with provision for armoured containment and reinforcement to deal with frontline duties, this is the cutting edge of nautical powerpacks."
  waterproof_sealing_tech:0 "Waterproof Sealing"
  waterproof_sealing_tech_desc:0 "Streamlined building techniques and increased inspection efforts, along with better training for our shipyard crew as well as pitch-like substances for coating, will increase the structural integrity of our hulls, thus assuring it's waterproof property and resilience."
  multi_deck_construction_tech:0 "Multi-Deck Construction"
  multi_deck_construction_tech_desc:0 "Constructing our vessels in such a way as to allow independently armoured and stackable decks instead of a single, unified one should improve the structural integrity of our crafts, as it is assured by multiple bulkheads as well as fundamental hull reinforcement."
  outrigger_tech:0 "Outrigger"
  outrigger_tech_desc:0 "Outrigger stabilization structures can be equipped on most of our vessels to allow better seafaring capabilities in harsh weather, as well as decreased recoil during broadside fire, which should increase the general resilience of our vessels and reduce capsizing risks."
  proper_rigging_tech:0 "Square Rig Sails"
  proper_rigging_tech_desc:0 "Modifying our crafts to use a square sail, proven to be the most aerodynamically efficient, should improve our strategical mobility. Instead of a single fabric, it uses multiple small ones on a single mast, reducing the necessary crew to fold or unfold them. They are also more resistant to damage, as a single small sail lost barely impacts the now increased top speed."
  metal_bows_tech_desc:0 "Impact analysis run on our vessels have allowed us to identify their most commonly targeted areas during battle. This obviously include the broadside, but the bow is also a target, as our ship manoeuvre around the battlefield. Reinforcement to it should help our crafts withstand more damage without losing the ability to fight."
  naval_manuals_tech:0 "Naval Manuals"
  naval_manuals_tech_desc:0 "Detailed operating manuals, that aren't 500 pages long this time, should help our crew rapidly identify problems and resolve them in the most appropriate way. And though we appreciate the sense of humour of it's writer, maybe we shouldn't let the final print mention the response to a critical hull breach being \"Blame the Enclave\""
  naval_armor_reinforcement_tech:0 "Armour Reinforcement"
  naval_armor_reinforcement_tech_desc:0 "Bolting points and welding trail are all flaws in the armour scheme of our vessels. And while we cannot reasonably make a monocoque design, we can still reinforce those key positions with additional plating. This should ensure that they will not buckle or shatter on impact."
  naval_wonders_of_the_past_tech:0 "Wonders Of The Past"
  naval_wonders_of_the_past_tech_desc:0 "Our engineers have finally managed to disassemble and replicate a pre-war engine, taken from an abandoned tanker. Providing propulsion and efficiency on an incredible scale, they will allow us to repair and use those pre-war behemoths. Their advanced technology can also be retrofitted to all other vessels in the fleet for improved propulsion."
  naval_secondary_engines_tech:0 "Secondary Engines"
  naval_secondary_engines_tech_desc:0 "Secondary engine bays, installed in distant and armoured locations away from the main motor compartment, will provide more power to the propulsion units and ensure tactical mobility in case of a critical hit. It will also increase the engine's service life, as power load is shared."
  naval_emergency_sealing_tech:0 "Emergency Sealing"
  naval_emergency_sealing_tech_desc:0 "Hull breaches are horribly dangerous situations. If not handled properly, they can mean the end of any ship, no matter the size. Providing our navy with elite damage control teams will decrease this risk. Operating underwater, with protective equipment, and using hyperbaric welding devices, they can swim in a flooded compartment and seal the breach at it's source."
  naval_armour_tech_1:0 "Wood Treatment"
  naval_armour_tech_1_desc:0 "To be able to field wooden ship on an organized scale, we must make efforts to standardize and improve current designs. Choosing from the multitude of different hulls, and treating it further with anti-fouling paint as well as simple copper plating, will allow us to mass produce naval crafts."
  naval_armour_tech_2:0 "Wrought Iron Manufacturing"
  naval_armour_tech_2_desc:0 "Wrought iron smelting and shaping techniques can be used to our advantages for increased efficiency in ship building. Cladding our wooden hull with additional iron plating and more advanced copper lining will add protection to our vessels while keeping cost and weight down."
  naval_armour_tech_3:0 "Steel Layering"
  naval_armour_tech_3_desc:0 "Steel mass-manufacturing and shaping require immense facilities, as well as specialized dockyard expansions. Though it will take time, the falling cost and rising practicality of steel hulls cannot be denied. As such we will redesign our ships to use metallic waterproof hulls."
  naval_armour_tech_4:0 "Alloy Smelting"
  naval_armour_tech_4_desc:0 "Equipping our foundry with the latest alloy production devices, such as high-intensity burners and powered degating tools, will give us materials refined enough to be used as military-grade plating. They can be used for a variety of purposes, from lightening our screening vessels to reinforcing our first-line crafts."
  naval_armour_tech_5:0 "Composite Plating"
  naval_armour_tech_5_desc:0 "Using powder-based manufacturing technique, we can considerably reduce the production cost while allowing an incredible range of metal to be used in composite alloy. Atomization processes allow metallic powder to be mixed with other materials, such as carbon or cobalt, which is then compacted at high pressure to form composite armour plating."
  naval_invasion_tech_1:0 "Assault Canoe"
  naval_invasion_tech_1_desc:0 "Using canoe to transport our troops for naval attacks are pretty much all we can do right now. Still, there are way to make it much easier to debark for our soldiers. A mounted rifle at the prow will give some suppressing fire during assaults, and light armouring with a raised hull should protect against small arms."
  naval_invasion_tech_2:0 "Armed Crafts"
  naval_invasion_tech_2_desc:0 "High-speed motorboat, transporting a full platoon and armed with a forward-mounted machine gun and gun shield, should provide swift landing to our troops. The speed and agility of these crafts, combined with it's beaching capabilities, should improve the speed and effectiveness of naval assaults, while the armoured gun mount will provide support fire."
  naval_invasion_tech_3:0 "Armoured Carriers"
  naval_invasion_tech_3_desc:0 "Specialized troop carriers with forward-facing ramps, armoured against machine gun fire and shell splinters, should considerably improve the protection of our troops during landing operations. Fire support is provided by two autocannon turrets at the rear of the craft, as well as a clip-fed mortar in an open-top compartment further back, which should provide ample assistance during beach landing."
  naval_invasion_tech_4:0 "Fire Support Vessels"
  naval_invasion_tech_4_desc:0 "Providing our landing troops with support fire is capital during amphibious assaults. And while our armoured carriers make an admirable job of it with their hail of autocannon shells and mortar rounds, we need even more. Converting some of them to carry huge rocket battery all discharging at once on enemy positions should stun any defences, no matter how reinforced, which will open the way for our marines and infantry."
