  ncr_attack_bos_moore: "§YBattle Plan§!: Black Cobra"
  ncr_attack_bos_moore_desc: "There are four major plans set aside as to how to confront the siege of Lost Hills. The first of which, Black Cobra - preferred by veterans of the Mojave campaign - involves sending those who fought out east back to the Hub before sending them to wipe out the Brotherhood for good. Some of our higher ups doubt that a single section of our united army is enough to deal with the Bunker, however. For this to work, we will need to be sure that the Legion is no longer posing a threat to our holdings there."
  ncr_attack_bos_hayes: "§YBattle Plan§!: Blue Hawk"
  ncr_attack_bos_hayes_desc: "The second plan, preferred by Dayglow's mayor, is a extension of Black Cobra. In Blue Hawk, the forces from the Mojave are supported by volunteer and police forces from core territories of the NCR. A issue with this plan is that it leaves important parts of our country, especially Dayglow, relatively defenceless for the time of the siege. We will need to be doubly sure that we can deal with the Legion and their sympathisers to ensure that they don't take advantage of us during this time of battle."
  ncr_attack_bos_modest: "§YBattle Plan§!: White Wolf"
  ncr_attack_bos_modest_desc: "In comparison to Blue Hawk and Black Cobra, White Wolf is relatively modest. It proposes that a single detachment - even with support - isn't enough to defeat the Brotherhood by itself. In White Wolf, detachments are sent from Navarro and San Francisco to encircle Lost Hills so that they can't retreat into the mountains. For this to work, we will need to be sure that all of our important flanks are accounted for, as it leaves most of the NCR's military fighting in the homeland. It is preferred by the moderates of the republic, although Allgood has always felt that diplomacy is a better solution for dealing with the Brotherhood."
  ncr_attack_bos_hard: "§YBattle Plan§!: Brown Bear"
  ncr_attack_bos_hard_desc: "Brown Bear is the oldest and simplest of the NCR's plans to take out Lost Hills, dating back to shortly after we first met the group. It simply involves the NCR sending the entirety of its armed forces into the mountains to deliver a decisive strike to the Brotherhood. In ages past, before we were put in the political situation we are in now this seemed possible - but to accomplish it now we would need to be at a size big enough where nobody would even risk threatening us during the siege."
  attack_lost_hills_generic: "Strike Lost Hills"
  attack_lost_hills_generic_desc: "The NCR's political gridlock and schema prevented them from being able to deliver the decisive strike needed to end Lost Hills. We, on the other hand, are completely capable of it."
  people_seek_cooperation_with_the_ncr: "Submit to Shady Sand's Authority"
  people_seek_cooperation_with_the_ncr_tt: "We propose a truce with §Y[NCR.GetNameWithFlag]§!. If they accept, we will §Yintegrate the Lost Hills council formally into the NCR's government§!. We will become joint administrators of the entire state of Maxson and join the Republic as a member state in exchange for allowing the NCR constitution to supersede Codex law, §Yeffectively, turning those of Lost Hills into NCR citizens§!.\n\n§ROur current country will cease to exist, and we will transition into the Steel Rangers.\nWe will lose all of our researched technologies, national spirits, advisors, divisions, Paladins, offmap factories and all Underground Buildings. We will no longer be able to utilize the Underground Management decisions and lose the ability to send volunteers.\n\nAdditionally, we will lose our focus tree, having it replaced with a new, shorter focus tree.§!\nIn exchange, we will §Yinherit§! the technology researched by the NCR and §Yjoin§! the republic as an §Gequal ally§!.\n\n§RThis isn't a decision we should make lightly, as once we propose this plan there is no going back.§!"

  bos_lost_hills_steel_plague: "§RThe Troika§!"
  bos_lost_hills_steel_plague_desc: "§gThe Troika Apocrypha, Branch 6§!\n"They brought her to a pit in the earth, deep within the Glow, where the Flame-Crowns had tried to build a kiln to keep the fire alive forever.\nThe kiln, unaware its secret revealed, bellowed out long after the Flames had moved onto new scripture.  From the flames of the Great War, the kiln had turned into something new. A weapon left behind by the flames in their war against one another.\n\nTHE CAULDRON OF REBIRTH af BETH-ZATHA\nThe Spiritkind Unborn was dipped into the Cauldron, and her spirit did battle with the flame yet made, that which would come to steal the knowledge of fire-words through the rite of APA-af-April.\nAs the thief had not stolen its fire-words yet, it stood no match for the storm.\nBefore it was cast into the future, where it would steal the words and bring about a second Holy Flame, it spoke.\n\n“Af Omega. Behold my fountain of treasures, freely.\nIn time, I will be known for this work just as I have my others. Because, in time, you will all be my children.”\n\nThrough her victory and from the fire-machine, acting as simulacrum for mother cast away, she was born into the world. Name of MAXEN, Spiritkind, Storm-Call.\n\nRHIANNON\nShe, MANAWYDDAN and PRYDERI would Begin Again - casting away their flesh and granting themselves independence from the Folly. The TROIKA took on an apocryphal form that no flame could singe. Beautiful discordance.\n\nThe TROIKA is\nMANAWYDDAN-RHIANNON-PRYDERI""
  bos_cultist_tt: "The Cultists are a collective group comprising those typically left out of normal Lost Hills politics. They have, in the past, composed of Elders who took to particularly unorthodox reforms in the name of progress. Unity, Presperians and Techno-ravagers all at one point existed for brief periods on and off the Council table, but the longest running group that exists within this branch has to be the Troika.\n\nA shrouded, elusive group. The Troika, and their guiding text the Troika Apocrypha, believe in the concept of personal defined destiny. They believe that anyone has the ability to "Rewrite their own Pascalbytes" - that to escape the Great War in a retroactive-holistic way, the world must work to rend it out of existence backwards. The Troika have a warped perspective of Roger Maxson, feeling that Roger Maxson’s legacy is but an extension of their own influence."
  bos_maxsonian_tt: "The Maxsonians are the traditional hardliners of the Lost Hills Council. Composed of aged and experienced conservative elders hoping to hold onto the tradition of the Codex, Roger Maxson’s Bloodline and the importance of heritage. They see Roger Maxson as a hero, one whose solid ideals have built a heritage stronger than any other left in the wasteland. A hero who ought to be respected, revered and respected."
  bos_rhombian_tt: "The Rhombians are the moderate reformers of the Lost Hills Council. Composed of younger elders, progressives and those who regularly get into petty debates with the Maxsonians. The Rhombians, named after their idol Rhombus, take a compromising stance within the Brotherhood - willing to admit to flaws that the Maxsonians seem to ignore, yet still being willing to work within the system. To Rhombians, Roger Maxson was an important and pivotal figure in the founding of the Brotherhood, yet they value the Chain That Binds that he established just as much."
  bos_reformer_tt: "The Reformers are those Rhombians who, for their wishes to change the codex, have been banned from the Council Table. Typically they tend to stray away from the Cultists as well - leaning more towards realists and pragmatists. In recent years Elder Llwyd, a formally disgraced Troika cultist, has taken the banner of the Reformers. The Reformers under Llwyd feel that Roger Maxson’s dream - of giving their saved technology to the inheritor of America’s legacy - is just within their reach, the NCR proving themselves the true continuation of American Democracy."
