  vip_no_step_on_snek_desc: "We are just a shadow of our former self. Reduced to common raiders using whatever weapons we can find and surviving by ambushing lone travellers. We could be so much more. We should be more. Like we were when we ruled the wastes of California."
	vip_high_priestess: "High Priestess?"
  vip_high_priestess_desc: "A step in the right direction is bringing back the some of the old titles. The leader of the Vipers was known as the Great Snakekeeper, but traditionally was male. The highest ranking woman was usually the high priestess. Now the question becomes if Veronica should claim the title of Great Snakekeeper for herself, or stick to the more traditional title of High Priestess."

  vip_new_sources_of_poison_desc: "Access to the Shrine was lost long ago. Even the barrels full of snakes the Vipers carted around with them are long gone. But there are other ways to acquire the poisons needed to supply our weapons with the necessary deadliness. Certain types of plants, radscorpions, night stalkers. It ain't no snakes, but it'll do for now."
  vip_bringing_back_the_rituals: "Return of the Rituals"
  vip_bringing_back_the_rituals_desc: "One thing that made our people so strong back then was that we literally got rid of the weak ones. We had a regular ritualistic intake of poison to prove you were worthy in the eyes of the Great Snake. Also it gave you a really groovy trip if you didn't die, so there was that.\nLet's just hope the new stuff works the same."
  vip_slave_raids: "Sacrifices to the Great Snake"
  vip_slave_raids_desc: "The Great Snake requires sacrifices. And it would be really dumb to sacrifice our own people. We already lose enough to the whole drinking poison thing. So we capture people. And we allow them to do the whole drinking poison thing. If they survive, they were strong enough to join. If they don't, they were a sacrifice. Win-win situation, really."
  vip_crimson_tongues: "The Return of the Crimson Tongues"
  vip_crimson_tongues_desc: "The Crimson Tongues were the elite of the elite among the Vipers of old. And while we doubt any of our current crop are even close to that level of skill, maybe given the best we have a title will encourage them to be better."

  vip_the_vision: "The Vision"
  vip_the_vision_desc: "During the monthly trance, Veronica had a vision from the Great Snake. It showed her the old Shrine, damaged but still there. Waiting.\nThe location was hazy but it definitely was in the area now controlled by the NCR, somewhat south of Shady Sands.\nWell, this might be a challenge."

But our warriors have gotten remarkable good at using them. Good enough to make full scale use of them to take back the Shrine."

  vip_take_back_the_shrine_desc: "It's time. Probably. The visions weren't actually that specific about a time frame to get to the Shrine. But we should do it anyway. For the Great Snake!"

  vip_vipers_reborn_desc: "So, this is a thing.\nWe somehow managed to reclaim the Shrine. From the NCR.\nHuh, neat.\nWell, I guess we could settle some old grudges? Or just chill a bit. Enjoy the mutfruits of our labour. Dunno."

  vip_legacy_of_great_snake: "Legacy of the Great Snake"
  vip_legacy_of_great_snake_desc: "Decades before the Vipers were forced to flee California by the Brotherhood of Steel, the Vipers worshipped their Great Snake god. Their entire lives and cultures revolved around the Great Snake, and its poison: sacrifices were made to it, its poison was ritually consumed and weapons were made smothered in its venom. While they lost access to their shrine, with it being most likely being destroyed by the Brotherhood when they finally drove the Vipers from California, fragments of the Vipers' old religion remains. One of the most important lessons that has survived the hard years the Vipers have wandered in the wasteland is regarding survival of the fittest. Sure, some half-decent cannon fodder may die before their time, but this way the Vipers are strong."

  vip_a_broken_tribe:0 "A Shattered Tribe"
  vip_a_broken_tribe_desc:0 "When a band of Vipers set upon a patrolling group of the Brotherhood of Steel in 2155, they had no idea who they were making enemies with. In the resulting fight the leader of the small Brotherhood patrol group, a certain Maxson II, was struck and fatally injured by a poisoned arrow. Unfortunately for the Vipers, Maxson II was none other than the Brotherhood's High Elder: his death stirred the Brothehood up into a genocidal fury. By 2161, after 6 years of being hounded relentlessly by the Brotherhood, the Vipers finally shattered. Bands fled across America, with some settling in the Mojave, some in Nevada and some as far afield as the Hounds of Hecate. The Vipers are a mere shadow of their former selves."
