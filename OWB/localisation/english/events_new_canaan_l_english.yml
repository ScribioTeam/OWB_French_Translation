By him the children of New Canaan sent tribute to Ryan King of Farfield.  \n\nNow Ehud made himself a dagger fastened it under his clothes on his right thigh. So he brought the tribute to Ryan king of Farfield.  And when he had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who had carried the tribute.

And God sent them a Prophet, who said, 'This is what the Lord your God, says: I brought you up out of Illinois, out of the land of slavery. And I delivered you from the hand of all your oppressors; I drove them out before you and gave you their land. But you have abandoned him. \n\nAnd Gideon asked God, 'If the Lord is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our ancestors told us about when they said, ‘Did not the Lord bring us up out of Egypt?’ But now the Lord has abandoned us and given us into the hand of the White Legs.

Deborah was overthrown in a populist uprising inspired by the faith. But Deborah died unrepentant and claiming she would be welcomed into the arms of the Lord.  \n\nHer final words were a quote from Brigham Young himself: 'The male portion of the human family are the lords of the earth, and they are full of wickedness, evil and destruction, and especially in their acts towards the female sex.

Pledging a continuation of the trading policies that have brought Canaan much wealth, as well as decisive action to improve the economy, Jeremiah has much to live up to. Even more pressing is the horrendous corruption that currently plagues the country, and whilst it might line Jeremiah's pocket nicely even he can see the damage it is causing his people.

Now, they got their punishment from God. Most of them lie dead in the streets of New Canaan, and the rest are scattered across the wasteland. Some have managed to find refuge amongst tribes we once preached in, as we have, but the numbers who have are a mere fraction of the congregation we once had. Jeremiah has reportedly escaped and fled to New Reno, where he has made use of his merchant contacts to create a comfortable life. That means that we need a new leader, one who can unify our fractured, confused and disheartened congregation so that we may, God willing, return to our holy lands. Two candidates present themselves, each with very different visions for our recovery. Daniel is the 'old' Mormon's favoured choice: his compassionate and measured approach promise unity and hope. The Burned Man, Joshua Graham, promises a radically different programme. A champion of the tribes, Graham is calling for militarization and unification to crush the White Legs once and for all.

Corruption was rife, with greasing the right palms becoming almost a necessity to survive, and it remains at endemic proportions even now the war is over. The economy is close to collapse, having being strained by the fighting, and to make matters worse even our closest tribal allies are eyeing us with suspicion now that we occupy vast swathes of land that isn't ours. \n\nWe, the congregation, therefore face a choice. Do we throw our support behind Jeremiah once more, or do we choose a new leader? Jeremiah certainly saw off the White Legs aptly, and he seems keen to reform the economy, but there are doubts about how far he may go to combat corruption. Daniel, meanwhile, has pledged to reform the church and eliminate corruption, but he is less willing to follow through with necessary economic reforms. Who shall lead the flock forwards?"

Some claim to have seen him weeping, presumably mourning the city he grew up in and the people he once called his brothers and sisters. Whilst Caesar expected this behaviour from him temporarily, Caesar expected him to continue soldiering on with his calls of duty. This has not been the case. Not only has the Legate been flagrantly disregarding his duties to the Legion, but he has also suffered frequent angry outbreaks at his advisors and friends. Whilst this may have been tolerable for a short period to Caesar, what was not tolerable is the brazen outburst he hurtled at Caesar himself during a war council meeting this morning. Not only did the Legate dare question Caesar's express orders, but he went on to denounce Caesar's decision to support the White Legs in their conquest of Utah. It was truly an outburst to behold!"

A gifted translator and devout Mormon, he was sent amongst the tribes to help them communicate with each other and outsider traders, brokering many a peace deal and trade treaty in his time amongst the tribes. During one of these many missions, Graham helped a certain Edward Sallow out of dire straights, and an ill-fated friendship was formed. Sallow persuaded Graham to stray ever further from God, and together the two laid the foundations of what would become Caesar's Legion. Sallow took the helm, but Graham was his trusted right hand man. Together, the two commit unspeakable atrocities far to our South, with Sallow persuading Graham to deviate ever further from his Mormon principles. \n\nThe friendship could never last, however. Caesar was ever fearful that Graham may one day eclipse him in power and popularity, and so kept a wary eye on him at all times. Sure enough, Graham stepped out of line one too many times, and so Caesar ordered him executed in the most horrific manor possible: covered in pitch, set alight, and thrown into the Canyon to our south. Caesar thought him surely dead, but by a miracle of God, Graham was spared from death. Badly wounded but with his faith in God burning brighter than our brightest flame, Graham staggered back to the tribes of Utah, who provided him with medicine, bandages, and space to rest. After recovering his strength, Graham embarked on a journey back to New Canaan, where we have welcomed him with open arms and without question.

We anticipated that the demands wouldn't go down well with some of the congregations, but we were not expecting quite such an uproar.

Every attempt at even minor reform Daniel has attempted has been met with fierce opposition amongst local clergy and congregations, and as a result Daniel has been forced to back down more times than he cares to count. Until today. This morning, enraged by the refusal of the Church to accept any reform whatsoever, Daniel has sent an extensive set of demands to every church and congregation that adheres to the Mormon faith, laying out his detailed ideas for reform. The demands have been wholeheartedly rejected by about half of the Church, who have taken up arms in an attempt to depose Daniel for his heretical act of authoring what they dub Daniel's 'Ninety-five Theses'.

This has been met with fierce criticism, both across [NCN.GetName] and in our own lands, so much so that all-out civil war has broken out in [NCN.GetName] proper.

One thing is clear to Daniel when it comes to the tribes of Utah he has spent so much time amongst, and that is that they too can see the light of the Lord, given time and tender care. Our first actions in this new era must be to spread word of our Lord to these tribes, with unified and coordinated force, so that they too may follow the word of God and his speaker on earth, Daniel. Whilst this is happening, we also have significant political changes that need to occur for the Church to fulfil the full potential Daniel sees in it: and these will not be easy to implement.

Jeremiah's next priorities are twisting the tribes around us to his whim, though it seems unlikely he'll be able to manage this without dropping the pretence that he is doing this for the good of the congregation and not just himself.

  nf_ncn.33.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, negotiations with [WHT.GetLeader] and the [WHT.GetName] as a whole have broken down. Too many potential issues presented themselves with any possible alliance agreement for [WHT.GetLeader] to be happy enough to agree. The main sticking point seems to be the White Legs ceding back our old lands: a point that is non-negotiable for us. Sadly, it seems war is the only option left to us."

  nf_ncn.34.d:0 "Far away, in the wastelands of Utah, a group of Mormon believers have established themselves in the ruins of what was Ogden and Salt Lake City. Having struggled for many years with the Caesar's influence corrupting tribes in their vicinity, ultimately leading to the sack of New Canaan at the hands of the Legion-sympathetic White Legs, the Canaanites have decided to tackle the problem at the head, waging their own war against the Legion in and around Utah. They've offered an alliance of convenience: we each promise to share intelligence and technology, whilst also promising not to sign a separate peace if either side were to capitulate. They also emphasize that this alliance would be purely until the Legion has been defeated. Surely this is a good deal?"
  nf_ncn.34.a:0 "We shall agree to this alliance."

This is surely one of our greatest diplomatic triumphs, and should leave [CES.GetLeader] quaking in his boots!"

  nf_ncn.38.d:0 "Whilst we control a large amount of territory outside of our holy cities, much of it has yet to properly see the light. In an effort to avoid another sack of New Jerusalem at the hands of disgruntled outsiders, we have more or less opened our borders for all those seeking a peaceful life, helping our relations with the tribes around us significantly, but hurting our Mormon dominance. For the most part, we can keep rival power bases in check, but two groups are of particular concern to us: the Brigham Barons in the north, led by the young industrialist Rachel May, and the Farfield 'Warband', led by Marcus Furness, whose parents led the original sack of New Jerusalem. Whilst neither of the two are openly rebellious, we fear one or the other may soon be if we do not take action to help them and their followers feel a part of our country."

Collecting together all manner of disenfranchised tribals, dissatisfied ex-raiders and even some wannabe-slavers, [FAR.GetLeader] has declared an open revolt, and even as we speak he marches on New Jerusalem with his hosts, seeking to re-create the Sack of New Jerusalem his parents masterminded many years ago.

  nf_ncn.41.d:0 "Following the unification of the tribes of Utah under my rule, I have followed a path similar to that tread by Saul, the fist King to unite the twelve tribes of Israel. Under Saul's wise leadership, Israel managed to fend off many foreign threats, just as I have managed to protect Utah from those who wish to enslave it. Like Saul, I have been granted my place at the head of the tribes by the Lord, and so, like Saul, maybe I too should claim a title of my own. Saul was the first King of Israel, and so should I be the first King of Utah? Or perhaps, to hark back to the pre-War traditions that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was powerful in Utah's state affairs, I should name myself Utah's Governor: a title more closely matching my mercantile ambitions. Maybe instead I should choose not to adopt a formal title: surely this would bring me closer to the people I lead..."

It was on this day in 1847 that Brigham Young and his followers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, where they would go on to found Salt Lake City, or as we now call it: New Jerusalem. Whilst New Jerusalem is a mere shadow of the grandeur Salt Lake City possessed, every year we can see yet more progress towards the rejuvenation of the city. So, in honour of our progress towards a new tomorrow, one closer to God, tonight we shall feast, dance and sing our songs!"

The Mormons have declared their domain 'Deseret', as their ancestors did when they established themselves on the banks of the Salt Lake, a safe and prosperous state that follows much the same borders as Utah did before the Great War. It's not been an easy struggle for the Mormons to get this far: having lost New Canaan to the White Legs, it took much sacrifice for the Canaanites to re-establish themselves amongst the tribes they once preached to, and even more sacrifice to return to their home lands. Truly, the Canaanites are blessed by good fortune if not a God, and any nation setting their eyes on Utahan lands faces a daunting enemy indeed."

  nf_ncn.55.d:0 "Jessica Worton, a junior missionary and faithful zealout, burst into a meeting of the clerical leadership this morning dragging Matthew Green by the scruff of his neck behind her. In front of the entire Church's leadership, she denounced Matthew as the leader of a heresy against the Church! The heretics, Jessica claims, call themselves \"Danish\" Mormons to distinguish themselves from our Church. Matthew shakes his head in exasperation, asserting the group are instead merely recognising their \"Danish\" heritage, meaning that their ancestors were born in a country called \"Denmark\" far across the Eastern Sea. In his words this is simply a huge misunderstanding, and there are actually lots of faithful \"Danish\" Mormons among the congregation who haven't yet realised their heritage. Is this an innocent statement, or is it a veiled threat? What do we do with these two? Is \"Denmark\" even real? \n\nAccess to the Old-World Church's meticulously kept records would swiftly clear this issue up, but between a nuclear apocalypse and multiple raids they're sadly somewhat inaccessible. [NCN.GetLeader] and the clerical leadership will just have to make up their minds based on the arguments presented to them. Oh, or the word of God if he feels like helping us out on this one."
