  LAP_KAALISHEELEETE_DESC:0 "Kaalishéeleete, To not be subject to death, carries her history on her face. Her exploration into, and eventual abandonment in, South Dakota's subway system has left her subject to an endless natural life. Being trapped in a automated subway tube, being exposed to cycles of high and low intensity radation, seeing the extent of horrors of the old world. The reigning Chairman was surprisingly open to concerns brought forth by Kaalishéeleete, appointing her head of the investigation to find the extent of ghoul presence in the subway tubes of Dakota. Before her first exploration back, underground rumblings and heavy feral sightings left her team without any way to cross the river. Since then she has risen through the tribe using tactful fear mongering and mobilization. The Crow can only hope their preperations have not been in vein."
