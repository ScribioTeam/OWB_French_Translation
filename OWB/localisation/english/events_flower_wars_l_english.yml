  flw.1.t:0 "Movements on the Border"
  flw.1.d:0 "Reports from the front tell a worrying tale, Enemy troops are being relocated to the border of [?Global.flw_defender_state.GetName]! This is far too close to our borders to just be routine training exercises, our treacherous neighbours must be preparing for an attack!"
  flw.1.a:0 "To arms! An attack must be imminent!"
  flw.2.t:0 "Political Repercussions"
  flw.2.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to ignite a small scale conflict for [?Global.flw_defender_state.GetName], it seems that we've simply failed to create the momentum needed to justify an attack like this; in light of such circumstances we're forced to step down, lest we risk a full scale conflict."
  flw.2.a:0 "Defeat at enemy hands would have been kinder than this..."
  flw.3.t:0 "Initiative Failures in [ROOT.flw_enemy]"
  flw.3.d:0 "Though for a time it looked as if our neighbours were moving to seize [?Global.flw_defender_state.GetName], things have petered out on the border. Due to any combination of internal circumstances, our enemies are no longer making an effort to seize our territory."
  flw.3.a:0 "The fools knew they stood no chance!"
  flw.4.t:0 "The Flower Wars Heat Up!"
  flw.4.d:0 "Our initial suspicions about troops building up on the border of [?Global.flw_defender_state.GetName] were correct! [ROOT.flw_enemy] is making a run at trying to seize the territory before we commit our full fighting force to defending it! Time will tell whether or not what border forces we do have will be able to win the day."
  flw.4.a:0 "We shall show them our mettle!"
  flw.5.t:0 "The End of the Flower Wars"
  flw.5.d:0 "Following the outbreak of a civil war for control of the Aztlán Empire, the importance of the minor skirmishes commonly dubbed the \"Flower Wars\" has faded in the eyes of the people on both side of the border. Instead, the two powerful factions of the Aztlán Empire are at each other's throats, and rumour has it that the Itzan War Council are begging [ITZ.GetLeader] for intervention. It seems, unless the Itza are placated, the \"Flower Wars\" might turn into a very real war..."
  flw.5.a:0 "A tale as old as time ends with less than a whimper..."
  flw.6.t:0 "Agitation in our Territories!"
  flw.6.d:0 "Recent operations by [ROOT.flw_enemy] have successfully turned the populace against us! Some of our soldiers have been killed, and our war effort is greatly diminished. We'll need to take steps to keep this from happening again."
  flw.6.a:0 "Dammit!"
  flw.7.t:0 "Our Drugs are Spiked!"
  flw.7.d:0 "We have a tendency to distribute drugs amongst our population. Unfortunately, our last distribution used little security, which allowed enemy operatives to spike our drug supply. This is a serious crisis, and will set back our country greatly."
  flw.7.a:0 "Agh! Mch back ptoey!"

  flw_clash.1.t:0 "Victory on the Border"
  flw_clash.1.d:0 "With merry moods and hardened hearts, our brave Aztlán warriors return from their conquest of [?Global.flw_defender_state.GetName]; though this conquest was not without loss, it brought with it great gain in the everlasting struggle with our eternal rivals."
  flw_clash.1.a:0 "Bring the spoils back to [Root.Capital.GetName]!"
  flw_clash.2.t:0 "Defeat at Itzan Hands"
  flw_clash.2.d:0 "The underhanded \"Empire\" of Chichen Itza has seized [?Global.flw_defender_state.GetName] from us! In a surprise attack, Itzan forces were able to overrun our border forces and seize the territory before we could react with a full military response."
  flw_clash.2.a:0 "We must counterattack soon!"
  flw_clash.3.t:0 "Clash Ends in Stalemate"
  flw_clash.3.d:0 "What glory is to be found in a war with no winners? Today, Aztlán mothers weep for sons lost in a stalemate over the territory of [?Global.flw_defender_state.GetName]; no victory was claimed, just the lives of many young warriors."
  flw_clash.3.a:0 "A stalemate is better than a defeat, just."
  flw_clash.4.t:0 "Victory on the Border"
  flw_clash.4.d:0 "With merry moods and hardened hearts, our brave Itzan warriors return from their conquest of [?Global.flw_defender_state.GetName]; though this conquest was not without loss, it brought with it great gain in the everlasting struggle with our eternal rivals."
