  des_mojave_desc:0 "The people of Nevada are forever in debt to the Rangers, and often shower them in what supplies they can spare.

  des_vipers_desc:0 "The Vipers are snakes in the worst sense of the word. They lied, cheated, and betrayed to get where they are in this world. We would be wise to view them as a serious threat going forward, and wiser still to not underestimate their ability to backstab us."

  des_thrasher:0 "Thrasher Sagarra"
  des_thrasher_desc:0 "The xenophobic and technocratic Thrasher Sagarra has been appointed to the position of Head Ranger!

The formation of a formal military union between the Rangers and their more heavily armoured cousins in California."

  des_knights:0 "Knight Assault Tactics"
  des_knights_desc:0 "The Rangers have extensive records of almost every conflict that the Brotherhood of Steel has engaged in within their borders. The dissection of their simplistic, but effective assault tactics has long been a personal hobby of Sagarra, who can now put his studies to use in training the newest generation of Rangers."

  des_workbench:0 "Workbench Instruction"
  des_workbench_desc:0 "The more simplistic models of energy weapons can be mass produced with relative ease, provided that one has a workbench with all the essential tools and a ready supply of the necessary components."

  des_database:0 "Database Sharing"

  des_steel:0 "Steel Rangers"
  des_steel_desc:0 "The Desert Rangers have long wasted time and resources in the Sands of Nevada and Arizona, protecting the few while struggling to arm and supply themselves.

  des_bosfunding_desc:0 "The Brotherhood is a military organization, first and foremost, and our recent acceptance into their ranks has resulted in a largely beneficial exchange of men and equipment, with us reaping the lion's share of such rewards."

  des_vargas:0 "Snake Vargas"
  des_vargas_desc:0 "Despite a bad knee and an ageing mind, Snake Vargas has decided not to retire. This was due in part to all of his viable replacements clearly wishing to side with a local power, rather than continuing on with the dream of the Rangers. A safe and unified wasteland should be the goal of the organization, not political squabbling."

  des_tread:0 "Don't Tread On Me"
  des_tread_desc:0 "The Desert Rangers are a fiercely independent organization under Vargas, and one that has been defending their territory for innumerable years with little worry.

  des_population:0 "Tribal Integration"
  des_population_desc:0 "There are many small, secretive tribes located within Nevada, all of whom are in some way shape or another, helpful to our cause.

  des_planning:0 "Wartime Planning"
  des_planning_desc:0 "The Desert Rangers must be prepared for any sort of incursion into our domain. Military drills and planning for yet unseen large scale conflicts are becoming more important by the day. If we ever have to mobilize for total warfare? The enemy won't find us wanting."

  des_radio_desc:0 "We've used our radio networks to communicate with townships and each other for decades, but we haven't had an established station, with news reports and music, in all that time.

  des_pact:0 "The Nevada Pact"

  des_razor_desc:0 "Hell Razor doesn't particularly care for the NCR, but he's one of the few survivors of our recent and disastrous expedition to Arizona, which left dozens of Rangers dead at the hands of the Legion. He understands their status as a threat, and more importantly, understands that the NCR is the only faction in all of the wasteland that is capable of stopping them."

  des_legionprep:0 "Preparing for the Legion"
  des_legionprep_desc:0 "Hell Razor and his cohort remember the dozens of Legion warriors who struggled to deal with their older fortifications and barbed wire.

  des_leadership:0 "Hands off Leadership"
  des_leadership_desc:0 "Hell Razor has never been a believer in the notion of drills or training mattering once you're out in the field. The only thing that can teach a man to survive is surviving, and the only thing that can teach someone how to kill is killing. "

  des_mechanized:0 "Ranger Mechanization"
  des_mechanized_desc:0 "It's a long way from the Citadel to the banks of the Colorado River, and if Hell Razor is ever going to hope to support the NCR in their war, he's going to need to be capable of shipping his men to that location quickly."

  des_californians:0 "California Recruits"

  des_citadel:0 "Citadel Landing Strip"
  des_citadel_desc:0 "The War with the Legion is one that takes place in a distant land, and aerial power and projection are all but necessary for it. The Brotherhood has generously offered to overhaul the landing strip at the Citadel so that we might better aid them."

  des_aviation:0 "Aviation History"
  des_aviation_desc:0 "While never have been particularly important in the Air Force, we have numerous schematics and machines capable of producing parts used in their construction. This makes us naturally capable of supporting and repairing a small air fleet of our own."

  des_recruiter:0 "Appoint Head Recruiter"
  des_recruiter_desc:0 "It takes a special kind of person to talk a person into giving up everything they have to fight for the better of others. Charisma is important, but so is the ability to channel all of that anger someone might have at the world, and work it until it is a blaze."

  des_propaganda:0 "Ranger Propaganda"
  des_propaganda_desc:0 "Not everyone knows about the Rangers, unfortunately. Yet we find that the more people learn of us, the more people are willing to join us and support our cause."

  des_trader:0 "Appoint Head Trader"

  des_outreach:0 "Community Outreach"

  des_armouries:0 "Ranger Armoury"
  des_armouries_desc:0 "The Ranger Armoury is one of the best of its kind.

  des_mechanic:0 "Appoint Head Mechanic"
  des_mechanic_desc:0 "A good Greasemonkey can be hard to come by, but we've gotten lucky lately. An Outcast from the 80's Tribe have come south to offer their services to us. Maybe they want payback against their former gang, maybe they just want to help, but either way? It's a godsend."

  des_depot:0 "The Depot"

  des_coop:0 "Ranger Cooperation"
  des_coop_desc:0 "We must work closely with the Rangers of the NCR if we are to triumph over the trials ahead. They are not unlike us, if a bit more militant when it comes down to core ideals. They shall be steadfast allies in the days to come."

  des_bunkers:0 "Breaking the Bunkers"
  des_bunkers_desc:0 "The Brotherhood of Steel like to hide in their holes, fortified pre-war bunkers, and similar complexes. Getting into them is a nightmare, but someone has to do it. Constant drills and training have prepared us for such a task."

  des_jericho:0 "Operation Jericho"
  des_jericho_desc:0 "Long ago, a fortress known as Jericho stood in defiance to the men and women of god. It was brought down by the wrath of god, and now? We shall invoke that same wrath against those who dared to strike at our allies in the NCR. If they will not stand with us against the Legion, they are against us."

  des_greatwar:0 "The Great War"
  des_greatwar_desc:0 "The Legion has come at last, and while even Hell Razor doubts that we can beat them, he rallies the men and women of the Desert Rangers for one last, great war. Some say he has a death wish, but he insists that he merely wants to instill in his men an understanding: there can be no victory without sacrifice."

  des_arizona:0 "Return to Arizona"

  des_honours:0 "NCR Honours"
  des_honours_desc:0 "We have proven that, with the help of our allies to the south, order can be restored even in the face of great adversity. Let those who seek to challenge us and our enemies tremble, for we are the honoured allies of the Republic and the guardians of its ideals."
