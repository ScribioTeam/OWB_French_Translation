This was fortunate indeed, because less than half a century after the Great War the Hondurans would find themselves under attack from Central America. It appears other Central and Southern American nations were not so fortunate in their preparations, and had fallen into raider-driven anarchy.

Regardless, the promise of future glory encourages swathes of desperate young people with no other life prospects to join the gangs. Poor buggers."

Of the many Shoshone groups, a significant number settled in Utah and southern Idaho, and achieved federal recognition in the late 1900s. Like many other Native American Nations and Tribes, the Shoshone fared resonably well in the post-apocalytic wasteland: their ancestoral teaching proved useful in an era of hunting and gathering, and the reservations the USA threw many native groups in were remarkably undamaged by nuclear hellfire. However, trouble began for the Shoshone in the decades after the nuclear ash began to settle. Utah and Idaho became stricken by religious wars: a huge variety of neo-christian groups, all with their own twisted interpretation of the bible, decided Utah should be theirs. Between the zealouts in Heavens Gate, the \"pious\" in High Chapel and the schism between Murtagah and the Lord's Annointed, the Shoshone found themselves being persecuted from all sides. Eventually the Shosone were forced to flee west, away from their ancestral land, where they remain plotting their next move."

We are advocates of the abolition of war, we do not want war; but war can only be abolished through war, and in order to get rid of the gun it is necessary to take up the gun."
