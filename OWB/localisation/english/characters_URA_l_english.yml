  URA_GABBAGHOUL_DESC:0 "Unfortunate naming led to the over-nuking of Uranium city, 212 individual nuclear strikes worth of over-nuking. The barely sentient beings remaining have no home left, with the city undetectable even with particulate checks. Long have they wallowed in pain, toxic sludge, and glowing craters, but the recent thawing has disturbed the ghoulish masses and they have begun to march southward. Whether they’re seeking relief or revenge none are sure, but those who’ve seen them recount tales of a horde so massive and irradiated it can be used as a marker for travel. When viewed directly the glow can burn the image of an endless horde of corpses falling apart at the seams into your eyes forever."
