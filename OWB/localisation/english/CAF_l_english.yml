  caf_merchant_marine_desc:0 "Due to our interest in coastal trading, we are of the few nations in Mexico that maintain any sizable naval presence. However, currently most of our vessels are shipping barges, if we are to exploit naval dominance of the west coast, we need to transform our merchant navy into a proper fleet."

  caf_light_ships:0 "Advance Skiffs"

  caf_extending_range_desc:0 "River expeditions and coastal hopping may have been sufficient before, but to able to reach new customers with our product we need to equip our ships with the resources and materials for long-distance expeditions."

  caf_ocean_focus:0 "Short Sea Shipping"
  caf_ocean_focus_desc:0 "The Benefits of coastal trading is that it's far faster than river-sailing, the downside is that, if something goes wrong, you're stranded on the coast of a foreign country with a payload of expensive coffee and no way to bring it back. But with the improvements made to our barges, we can reduce the risk of profit loss to a manageable level. "

  caf_river_focus:0 "Riverboat Diplomacy"
  caf_river_focus_desc:0 "The rivers are the veins of Mexico. Deploying our skiffs en masse to patrol our local riverways allows us to project a larger amount of influence in our neighbour's affairs."

  caf_merc:0 "Plantation Security"
  caf_merc_desc:0 "Manpower has never been our strongest suite. Often, we've had to outsource the security of our coffee plantations to our Aztec overlords. With Aztlan on the decline, however, we need to prepare to take control of our own military defenses."

  caf_quality_mercenaries:0 "Hiring the Best"
  caf_quality_mercenaries_desc:0 "There's no shortage of gunslingers that travel the wastelands of Mexico, but few among them are reliable, or competent. Large mercenary companies provide a solution to both these problems, providing skill and loyalty, as long as we provide the caps."

  caf_cartel_mercs:0 "Cartel Enforcers"
  caf_cartel_mercs_desc:0 "It's not enough to be able to shoot a plasma pistol, we need men who can inspire fear into the hearts of our enemies. The cartels of the north have refined cruelty into an art form, which is just what we're looking for in new employees."

  caf_rely_on_aztlan:0 "Rely on the Aztlan"

  caf_drugged_soldiers_desc:0 "We may not have the fervour, the weaponry, or the sheer bloodlust of our rivals, but we have one thing they don't: ludicrous amounts of drugs. With enough of our signature blend coursing through their veins, our men won't even feel the bullets ripping through their bodies."

  caf_business_as_usual:0 "Business As Usual"
  caf_business_as_usual_desc:0 "One of the most important rules of business is this: Never ruin a good thing. Our position with the Aztalan empire is far more profitable for us than them, so for now, let's let bygones be bygones."

  caf_cutting_a_deal:0 "Cutting A Deal"
  caf_cutting_a_deal_desc:0 "With their leader dead, their council indecisive, and their heir apparent an inexperienced novice, the Aztlani hold over us has never been weaker. And when there's weakness to be found, there's profit to be made."

  caf_secure_trade_routes:0 "Secure The Trade Routes"

  caf_trade_aztlan:0 "Trade With Aztlan"
  caf_trade_aztlan_desc:0 "Aztlan is the bread and butter of our coffee trade, but that doesn't mean we can take these customers for granted. A new trade initiative to the Aztalan border cities is the first stop in our coffee chain empire."

  caf_viceroyalty_monopoly:0 "Southern Monopoly "

  caf_viceroyalty_competition:0 "Taking Care of the Competition"
  caf_viceroyalty_competition_desc:0 "Though we have most of the market cornered in the empire of the Aztlani, there is some amount of competition left. [TVR.GetName] is investing heavily into commodity crops to support themselves as an independent state. Wouldn't it be a shame if someone dropped a match or 900 in their plantations?\n\n§g[ATE.GetName]'s decision is contigent on their opinion of [THIS.GetName]§!"

  caf_trade_honduras:0 "Trade with Honduras"

  caf_goods_for_guerreros:0 "Goods For Guerreros"
  caf_goods_for_guerreros_desc:0 "Not everyone wants to die in the jungle, in fact, most people don't. The role of a Costa Cafeinada security personnel officer, in comparison, is a retirement plan for a Guerrero, and we can use this this manpower influx to our advantage."

  caf_trade_tzotzil:0 "Trade With Tzotzil"

  caf_art_of_the_deal:0 "The Art of the Deal"
  caf_art_of_the_deal_desc:0 "As always, Baron Garcia has proven to be a brilliant negotiator, running circles around the outmached Aztlan delegation.

  caf_business_2:0 "Private Investments"

  caf_coffee_kings:0 "Coffee Kings"
  caf_coffee_kings_desc:0 "The foundation of Costa Cafeinada is coffee. Ground, premix, thermos-sealed, as long as it's coffee, we sell it. We are the kings of coffee not only in Mexico, but across America, and possibly, what's left of the whole world."

  caf_new_strain:0 "A New Strain"
  caf_new_strain_desc:0 "Complacency is the death knell of any organisation. Sure, we sell coffee, but why stop at just coffee? With the right blend of nuclear irradiated ingredients and proper mixing, a whole world of new flavours can be opened to us to sell to the unsuspecting public."

  caf_raider_roast:0 "§RRaider Roast§!"
  caf_raider_roast_desc:0 "What causes a man to lose his humanity? To become a wild animal, hating his own kind, ready to kill at the slightest provocation? We sure as hell don't know, but by sticking irradiated peppers into coffee we can get a pretty close simulacram."

  caf_muta_latte:0 "§GMuta-Latte§!"
  caf_muta_latte_desc:0 "Mutation: is it really that bad? Sure it seems to cut your life expectancy by half and your fertility rate by double that, but on the other side, it seems to make for a mindless, musclebound workforce to exploit."

  caf_the_perfect_blend_desc:0 "Drug psychos and caffeine fiends are all well and good, but when it comes down to it, what you really want, in this hell of a world that we are unwillingly borne into and forced to live in, is a damn fine cup of coffee. "

  caf_breadbasket_of_mexico_desc:0 "While the hot fires of nuclear annihilation may have turned the rest of the world into an unlivable hellscape, for us, it became a highly fertile hellscape.

  caf_inmecafe:0 "INMECAFE Techniques"
  caf_inmecafe_desc:0 "Often, when sorting through documents from before the war, we find memos from the Instituto Mexicano del Cafe. INMECAF distributed many materials to assist coffee farmers in the past, and, despite the slightly glowy soil, some of their guidance could help. [THIS.GetLeader] evenn has an idea on where their headquarters may lie."

  caf_bumper_crops:0 "Bumper Crops"
  caf_bumper_crops_desc:0 "A man cannot live on coffee alone, at least, not yet anyway. While we're working on that technical issue, rotating our coffee fields with high-yield grain crops can help offset our cost overheads."

  caf_secondary_industries:0 "Secondary Industries"
  caf_secondary_industries_desc:0 "There's a lot more to growing coffee than just a watering can and some dirt. From production, packaging, supply, and administration, our self-sufficency as an organisation has ensured our continued growth as a company."

  caf_soil_reclamation:0 "Soil Reclamation Projects"

  caf_natural_ingredients:0 "All Natural Ingredients"
  caf_natural_ingredients_desc:0 "Despite all good sense and logic, the people of the wasteland still keep trying to eat 200 year old boxes of preserved pre-war foodstuffs.
