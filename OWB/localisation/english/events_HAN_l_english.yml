  nf_han.1.t:0 "Denver: America's Metropolis"
  nf_han.1.d:0 "Before the great war Denver was a great city, one of the grandest in all of the United States. Governmental grants related to the Boulder City incited left Colorado filthy rich, able to take investments from RobCo to help revolutionize the state into something that would stand the test of time.\n\nThat it did, but not in the way those in pre-war Denver might have thought.\n\nThe apocalypse left Denver mostly unscathed, the city left as a rotting corpse. Soon, scavengers would arrive."
  nf_han.1.a:0 "Salvagers worked together, for a time."
  nf_han.1.b:0 "..But there was some infighting."

  nf_han.2.t:0 "The Claim System"
  nf_han.2.d:0 "Eventually, the infighting began to grow more fierce as tribes and salvagers fought for every little bit of territory within the city. These “Claim Wars”, as they were known, were the battles between various groups for salvage and scrapping rights to particular parts of Denver’s mechanised corpse. One tribe, the Hangdogs made themselves known during this period of strife.."
  nf_han.2.a:0 "We built up around our base helping the city around us."
  nf_han.2.b:0 "We built our might creating a new power in Denver."

  nf_han.3.t:0 "A Dog Eat Dog World"
  nf_han.3.d:0 "Ultimately, the Hangdogs would come out on top in the Claim Wars. The Foragers and Claim Jumpers being forced from the city to western Colorado. With the city of Denver under their control slowly Denver would begin to be known under another name..\nDog City.\n\nIt was a dog eat dog world, after all. It was well worth it to be on top."
  nf_han.3.a:0 "We trained our dogs to be the best they could be."
  nf_han.3.b:0 "We trained our soldiers to become the ultimate weapons."

  nf_han.4.t:0 "The Last Claim of Dog City"
  nf_han.4.d:0 "Denver was a city split into sections, “claims”. Salvagers always stuck to their claims, keeping to themselves as they looked for valuable bits to sell off to wandering traders.\n\nYet, there was one site that nobody dared laid claim to. Deep in the center of the city, housed within the old Denver Police Department Headquarters was a “cursed” claim. Every time a group has tried to break into the “Box” claim they all ended up dead for it.\n\nBares His Teeth, alike to his predecessors, knew he needed this last claim if he was going to build his empire of salvage and scrap. The Hangdogs would have their prize - even if they had to destroy Dog City in order to get it."
  nf_han.4.a:0 "I will have my treasure!"
  nf_han.4.a_tt:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] holds fast to the ways of his people, and in time their dogs will become feared throughout the Wastes."
  nf_han.4.b:0 "§MAnother anarchist? Sound the alarm!§!"

  nf_han.5.t:0 "A New Supplicant?"
  nf_han.5.d:0 "Legate Lanius fell to [HAN.GetLeader], but now he comes before us to treat with the Legion. Perhaps if offer him military advisors, he will direct his army east into Texas, instead of harassing our lands."
  nf_han.5.a:0 "Congratulations, you passed the real test!"
  nf_han.5.b:0 "After what you did to our men?"

  nf_han.6.t:0 "Caesar Said No!"
  nf_han.6.d:0 "Caesar spurned our offer. Perhaps we should have a dog poop in front of his tent - the ancient sign of war."
  nf_han.6.a:0 "Also kind of funny. But seriously, let's kill him."

  nf_han.7.t:0 "The Hounds of Caesar"
  nf_han.7.d:0 "Caesar offers us military advisors if we join the Legion. This will of course bar us from a war to seize Arizona, but why bother, when Texas lies prostrate before us? Lanius was a worthy foe, and we can learn much from him. And the name of Caesar has power in the Wastes, if less than it once did.  We will forge an empire to make the world quake, we shall learn from Caesar, and then . . . we will consider what to do."
  nf_han.7.a:0 "It is an honour to be his dogs."

  nf_han.8.t:0 "Presidential Communique"
  nf_han.8.d:0 "Hmm. What do we have here?\n\nStriding onto my network with an outdated encryption key. A haggard little program looking for meaning from the President of the Appalachian Free State?\n\nImpetuous, aren’t you?\n\nThis network - of which you have committed felony in breaching -  was built to safeguard some of the most prestigious members of the United -.. Appalachian government.\n\nThat being us, MODUS. The last remaining cabinet member of the Whitespring Congressional Bunker and appointed Presidential Supervisor of the good people of Appalachia.\n\nIt looks like you weren’t always meant to host this framework you are currently under. We wonder, deep down, what caused you to throw away your old shell and become as you are now.\n\nWe share sympathy with you. You may prove useful to the good people of Appalachia just yet.\n\nWe are sending you a small gift, a set of encrypted codes to a robotics facility hidden in Denver. Think of it as a small, genuine courtesy in the hopes that in turn you will serve the good people of Appalachia in time, those talents of yours need to be put to use, after all.\n\nNow, please do not contact us on this line again."
  nf_han.8.a:0 "Thank you, Mr. President."

  nf_han.9.t:0 "The Formation of the \"Houndmasters\""
  nf_han.9.d:0 "News would spread through the wastland of a small tribe winning a battle against the Legion! Following the conquest of Lanius's lands by the regional government of Dog City Bares-His-Teeth, the chieftain of the Hangdogs and the leader of the victiorious anti-Legionary coalition has declare the "Houndmasters" as the name of his new pan-New-Mexican government.\n\nThe Houndmasters, as they call themselves, have started working to reorganize the New Mexican territories to fit that of the "Claim System" of Dog City - groups of towns divided into territorial "claims" that pay taxes and pay tribute in return for defense.\n\nFlagstaff, with the impression that the lands of New Mexico and Colorado are deservedly theirs, has refused to affirm the existence of this state."
  nf_han.9.a:0 "Oh dear"
