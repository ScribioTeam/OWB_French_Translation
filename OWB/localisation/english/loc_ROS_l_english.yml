  ros_bless_the_rains_down_desc:0 "What goes up must come down, and the water and steam that erupt from the geysers and calderas of Yellowstone follows that adage as truly as anything else. The water that rains down nourishes the land and provides for both the inhabitants of the former park and those neighbors who are willing to pay top cap for water in dry days."

  ros_ecologist_legacy_desc:0 "The people of Yellowstone trace their lineage back in part to the rangers and conservationists who cared for the land in the days before the bombs fell. That duty to and respect for the natural splendor around them has not been lost even hundreds of years later. While they no longer understand the world quite as well as they did, they are careful to take only what is needed and to to reuse anything they can to avoid waste."

  ros_secrets_of_the_steam_desc:0 "Our people have always understood that great power and utility lay in the steam and heat that simmer just below the surface of the land, but those belligerents who once brought war to our home understood that power in different and sometimes frightening ways. We can put their research and methods to use, but in ways more suited towards helping rather than harming. Energy to light and warm our homes will make a good start, but there's so much more to learn."
