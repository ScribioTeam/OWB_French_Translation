  famous_actress: "World Renown Starlette"
  tof_movies:0 "A Star is Born"
  tof_movies_desc:0 "A fond memory among the 215th is how the Jericho Warden would take them out to the old drive-in after their work shifts. Overboss Marienne, to kindle respect among her gang wants to reshoot some of these pre-war movies they used to watch, giving leading roles to members of the gang!"
  movie_barfly: "\"The Barfly\""
  movie_barfly_desc: "This one, in the pre-war era, must have been a bitch to film.. Like, there weren't strange mutants and shit back then... Right?\nWe can just film regular Muties and call it a day. There’s a ghoul we found in one of our raids that's ugly enough to play the monster, and we can have a few of our heroic raider champions serve the role of good guys who beat him up for being so ugly!"
  movie_love: "\"Love Sets Sail!\""
  movie_love_desc: "Lots of people who are interested in movies have seen this flick. Some people say it is Vera Keyes' best role! We are going to have to work overtime to get a faithful reproduction of this movie out of the door - a custom set, custom lightning, reaching out to California for actors. Maybe even find a producer?\nEat your heart our Vera, Marianne’ one of the big shots now."
  movie_furies: "\"The Fighting Furies: Last Stand at Fort McGee\""
  movie_furies_desc: "We have a few tapes showing this one, a bit of an action flick showing people shooting each other with some rather fake looking old west style sort of antique guns. Rubbish! We can do something a lot better than that!\nLets name some little shitbag town Fort McGee, do a normal raid and just kill everyone! We can even hire a band to play live music beside the filming equipment to drown out the blood-curdling screams."
  movie_fish: "\"Night of the Fish Men's Revenge\""
  movie_fish_desc: "This one was always a bit of a bitch to film, since we never had a good enough vista to film it in. Now that we have a bit of a coast under our turf’ we can properly try to emulate this flick! Plot’s going to be about a sweet raider gal who fights off NCR-Goons coming in from the water. The water’s like, a personification of the NCR’s corruption.. Symbolism and shit, yeah?"
  movie_communists: "\"Communists from Space!!\""
  movie_communists_desc: "Marianne would have tried watching this with the boys on more than one occasion -.. But none of them seemed able to understand one of the critical plot points of the movie…\n\nThe fucks a communist?\n\nThe movie would sell a lot better if we changed out the plot some. Maybe.. Instead of whatever the fuck a communist is we can replace the enemies of the picture with Legionaries, and we can have brave Raiders be the ones to fuck them over and establish themselves as the top dogs!"
  movie_ripper: "\"Ripper!\""
  movie_ripper_desc: "The plot of this movie was about a little girl who went around stabbing people -.. That's funny!.. But Marianne had a better idea. What if you gave ‘everyone’ a knife, then that way it was like a huge fucking knife fight!\nLater on in the movie, near the final act some raiders can come in and shoot everyone. The moral of the story? Don’t bring a knife to a gunfight."
  movie_tokyo: "\"Tokyo Decadence\""
  movie_tokyo_desc: "For some reason, we could only ever watch the first few minutes of this one. The tape seemed to always cut out by the time the pizza guy came to the hotel room of the bar-room singer. We can fill in the plot! Maybe the name of the guy was "Tokyo", and the story was a bit of a fall from grace for him - how his own sin and the scars of his past kept him from advancing as a person, and only by becoming a raider and stealing pizzas from the chef down the street was he able to become someone great and win the love of his life."
