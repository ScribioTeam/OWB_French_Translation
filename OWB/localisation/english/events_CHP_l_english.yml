  nf_cph.1.d:0 "Due to several superior officers taking holiday leave, Colonel Jackson found herself the most senior Commanding Officer on October 23rd. The military police battalion she commanded was made of "Members of the Northern Frontier Territories" and Americans, their duty was to guard logistical routes in and around Regina. Upon nuclear detonation her mission changed, with the continued pacification of Canada seeming improbable she decided that her battalion's prime directive was to prevent the downfall of society.\n\nOr so we're told. In reality while much of this may be based in fact, we have no way of confirming due to the loss of the records after our expulsion from Regina."

  nf_cph.2.t:0 "The Third Colonel"
  nf_cph.2.d:0 "Colonel Davies began his day like he did every other day, shit shower and shave. Then he lead the penal work battalion into Cap Hell to start another day of swamp clearing for The Kingdom of Manitoba when suddenly... All Hell Broke Loose. A courier delivered to the Colonel an urgent report of revolt in Regina and the slaughter of nearly the entire garrison, Military Police included, all by the traitors of Metis. He set about ordering the prisoners to begin building a temporary holding cell until he got word from the Capital of what was going on. He mobilized his men and received a detachment from Yorkton informing him of the Metis rebellion, and of his recent victory against their armies. But Davies wouldn't sit around waiting for some up-and-coming noble to save him and his prison, no, he began a counter-attack.\n\nThis plan would see him lead his special forces directly to Regina, although smashing through the outer gates they became seperated during the fighting and Davies and 6 men would be the last to die. Fighting all the way to the old fort. All the way to home. "

  nf_cph.3.t:0 "The Fifth Colonel"
  nf_cph.3.d:0 "Once again Yorkton was under seige, once again we mobolized, and once again we fell in battle. \n\nA recent upset in the Electorals lead to a politically motivated invasion of the Kingdoms westerns territories. Always a friend to Yorkton, we heeded the call and were assigned rear guard.. Until recent 'reassignments' lead us to be needed on the front. And we did so valiantly. Even as the raider hordes crashed down on us. Even as Yorkton pulled back, then retreated, then fled. Colonel Foster would nearly die on that field, he hid in the bodied of his comrades and foes for two days until a search party lead by Colonel Daniels would find him. Though he lived he would never be quite the same, let alone lead his men."

  nf_cph.5.d:0 "A messenger barges into Colonel Jackson's frontline correctional facility \n\n"Uh, Sir? We've gotten reports from the labs of Dr. Toboggan.." \n\n"And? I've already heard about the Mutants, it can't get much worse than Super Mutants." \n\n"Well Colonel, the problem is that they're addicted to psycho." \n\n"P..p..psycho?" \n\n"Yes Sir, and whats worse is that our troops were either unable or unwilling to capture them for transport to a secure site and they... they killed them all Sir." \n\n"Ok, first I want to remove that division from combat to assess whether this was an intentional massacre, then I want to scout for any survivors. How will they accept our rule if we murder fucking drug addicted rehab patients?!?!""
