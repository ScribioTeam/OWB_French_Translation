  new_slagpuppet:0 "Ghost Town"
  new_slagpuppet_desc:0 "The Slags have made the decision to fully inhabit Modoc and its vicinity, moving in hordes of pale folk into the city streets as they take over homes and farmsteads. While the people of Modoc may not appreciate this we should help the Slags inhabit the city none the less."
  new_slageaten:0 "Moderating Modoc"
  new_slageaten_desc:0 "Now that the Slags have taken over Modoc there are still a few fearful and prejudiced folk that rebel against them, it's time we help them deal with these ingrates and ensure that the territories comply."
  new_modocfarming:0 "Modoc Farmsteads"
  new_modocfarming_desc:0 "The Slags have always been secondary citizens to the people of Modoc but it's time we show them some appreciation. We'll invest time and effort into their farms to ensure they no longer have to worry about lady luck playing a part in their crops."
  new_loosends:0 "Loose Ends"
  new_loosends_desc:0 "The Yakuza Territories have long been a scourge on our borders, always trying to plunder incoming caravans and scaring off outsiders. It's time we end their reign of terror and make a bit of profit in the process."
  new_connectsouth:0 "Californian Commerce"
  new_connectsouth_desc:0 "While we've always shared a border with the New Californians we now own a direct route to Shady Sands, it's time to exploit it now that the raiders are cleared off the roads. No doubt the NCR would gladly welcome us."
  new_sake:0 "Yakuzan Booze"
  new_sake_desc:0 "While the Yakuza folk may have not shown it, they have excellent taste in alcohol. We've found entire crates of this stuff called 'Sake', plentiful enough to last us years. Sending a shipment home to Reno would definitely boost our spirits and get us loads of caps in profit."
  new_hentai:0 "Countryside Marauding"
  new_hentai_desc:0 "While we welcome all sorts of folk into our society it seems some of these Yakuza folk can't abandon their raider past. Our patrols around town are always picking up the occasional murmur of warbands and gangs making a score. While this won't be beneficial to our citizens we can certainly seize their plunder."
  new_japansteel:0 "Nippon Steel Plants"
  new_japansteel_desc:0 "The Yakuza raiders may have been a bunch of thieving bastards but they did know how to work their steel, it would be wise to learn these secrets and take over their steel mills before they get sabotaged by outside forces."
  new_jackalsrush:0 "Jeopardizing The Jackals"
  new_jackalsrush_desc:0 "The Jackals are a load of sick freaks that somehow acquired the taste of human flesh, it's time we sanded off their tongues and put a few bullets between their brains. Thankfully due to our preparedness we won't even have to spend much time dispatching these degenerates."
  new_jackalsbuildup:0 "Catching Carson Criminals"
  new_jackalsbuildup_desc:0 "The Yakuza raiders that once inhabited Carson now are roaming in hoards of brigands looking for a person to rob for their next meal, it's about time we sent out a patrol or two to get rid of these greedy bastards."
  new_lakes:0 "Lakeside Industry"
  new_lakes_desc:0 "With the Yakuza raiders gone we now control a majority of Lake Tahoe, the newly conquered territories around it provide an opportunity to exploit this gem of a lake for our industry, it's not like anyone is going skinny dipping."
  new_jackalsplunder:0 "Plenty Of Plunder"
  new_jackalsplunder_desc:0 "The Jackals have long squandered the pile of wealth they sit on, it's time to liberate it from the dirty man eaters. We'll round up all the cannibal folk and make sure they never taste human flesh again with the best deterrent: a piece of lead in the brain."
  new_stateofreno:0 "Reno's Statehood"
  new_stateofreno_desc:0 "The New California Republic has stood as a benefactor for decades by now, perhaps it's time we apply for official statehood? Still maintain our independence but assure the Californian folks know we're on their side, both militarily and economically."
  new_cityofsins:0 "City Of Sins"
  new_cityofsins_desc:0 "New Reno has stood the test of time against foreign invaders and raiders, the city is thriving and our territories live in a state of pre-war luxury and sin. They always called Vegas the City of Sins but Reno has certainly owned the title."
  new_nevada:0 "Claiming Nevada"
  new_nevada_desc:0 "Nevada in its current state is a territory of feuding nations and raiders, it's time we put our foot down and begin bringing civility to these shit dens. Reno will certainly be a beacon of hope for the subjugated wastelanders living in these territories."

  new_catpaw: "Cat's Paw"
  new_catpaw_desc: "Cat's Paw the most famous of our city's fine brothels and which easily rivals the Gomorrah.  A pleasure for every purveyor, and it is ready, and waiting, for you! Just leave the kids in day care."

  new_tipography: "Restore Printing"
  new_tipography_desc: "Of course, Cat's Paw was not just a brothel, once there was a printing house that published the famous erotic magazine. Sadly, only a few copies are left of him that survived two centuries. But we can still restore the printing house and re-issue magazines."

  new_desperado2: "The Sombreros' Taco Bar"
  new_desperado2_desc: "The Desperado was never as big as Shark Casino, so we've turned it into a Mexican restaurant. Try some delicious Aztláni chilis as part of the Tlaloc Tuesday special."

  new_chopshop: "Chop Shop"
  new_chopshop_desc: "The Chop Shop originally appeared as a tiny workshop on the City's outskirts.  But now it's one of the best automobile dealerships in the Wasteland! Just make sure nobody keys your car.  Just kidding! \n\nThis joke constitutes full warning and absolves the Chop Shop of all liability."

  new_powerplant: "City Power Plant"
  new_powerplant_desc: "The Wrights have long been a part of the city's power structure, and, in fact, built our lovely power plant! Some say it's fueled by their self-satisfaction, but we know it's environmentally friendly coal."

  new_distillery2: "The Restored Distillery"
  new_distillery2_desc: "The Wright family distillery was sadly damaged in recent political struggles, but it's ready and working once again! Just don't try it on the rocks, mutant style."

  new_rail2: "Mine Railways"
  new_rail2_desc: "Once upon a time, one of the largest railways in the country passed near our city. We still take its metal for domestic use, turning old into new."

  new_rail:0 "East Side Rail Station"
  new_rail_desc:0 "Restoring the old rail station created a hub of infrastructure and another way for thrill-seeking NCR citizens or any citizen of the Wasteland to take a trip to the biggest little city in the world."

  new_newpeople:0 "Migrant Rush"
  new_newpeople_desc:0 "Hundreds of wastelanders now flock to our borders in search of a home and work. We can provide for these downtrodden folks and establish Reno as a haven for the refugees of the wastes."

  new_slvatorebar: "Salvatore's Italian Grill"
  new_slvatorebar_desc: "Salvatore's isn't just a bar - it has some of the best Italian food in the Wasteland. How do we know? It's the only Italian place, as far as we know!"

  new_slvatorebar2: "Cartucci's Pizza Place"
  new_slvatorebar2_desc: "Although the Salvatores have lost much influence, their contribution to Reno's culture lives on. Try the wood fired pizza at Cartucci's, and please ask no questions about the fate of the Salvatores."

  new_chem2: "Fun With Chems"
  new_chem2_desc: "The Salvatores always controlled chems in this city, despite what the Mordinos would tell you.  But there's more to the chemical industry than a hallucinogenic experience.  For instance, did you know the Indians use hemp to make rope?"

  new_arms: "New Reno Arms"
  new_arms_desc: "The New Reno Arms Company has long been a staple of Reno's economy, its new owner Algernon seems to be open to selling stake in the company. We can certainly give him a dodgy contract and buy them out to use their production for our own devices."

  new_goldenglobes: "Golden Globes"
  new_goldenglobes_desc: " The Corsican brothers created the first porn studio since the bombs fell, and they continue to provide morale support to the fighting men and women of the NCR. We don't just make money - we make a better world."

  new_sharkclub2: "The Megalodon club"
  new_sharkclub2_desc: "Shark Club was rightfully considered one of the largest gambling establishments in the city, attracting everyone who wished to try their luck. Now let's attract interested people to try their luck from all over northern California and Nevada. And its restoration under the name Megalodon Club will be our first priority."

  new_boxing2: "Gladiator Fights"
  new_boxing2_desc: "The Bishops promoted certain rules, such as banning blades or fights to the death.  But that was a bit boring.  Inspired by the Legion, let's make people fight to the death for sport! What fun."

  new_brokenhills: "What Was Left of Broken Hills"
  new_brokenhills_desc: "Once the old mine in Broken Hills ran dry, the humans had no more need for us and it showed. They moved away but we had nowhere to go, being surrounded by those afraid of who we are or what we may become. So we stuck together, made use of our knowledge and the final haul of sweet, sweet uranium. And we found a job in the biggest little town in the Wastes!"

  new_refuge: "Our new Home"
  new_refuge_desc: "Following our arrival in New Reno, things were a little rough. Luckily one of the abandoned industrial complexes gave us what we needed. We knew people would be afraid of us, so we had to hide what we knew and had or they would take it."

  new_protectionlaws: "Mutant Protection Laws"
  new_protectionlaws_desc: "With the rise of [Root.GetLeader] to one of the most influential figures of New Reno, it didn't take long for first efforts to strive for equality. And the first step included the protection of mutants that suffered not only through public shunning but also work exploitation. A new set of laws was quickly drafted and enacted, turning New Reno into a beacon for mutantkind as well."

  new_brokenvangraffs: "A Deal with the Van Graffs"
  new_brokenvangraffs_desc: "Sensing rising tensions in the area, especially with mutants going missing in the north, we are now forced to increase our capabilities. Our new home requires an upgrade. And who else can deliver the parts necessary without asking too many questions than the Van Graffs?"

  new_brokensierradepot: "Echoes of the Old World"
  new_brokensierradepot_desc: "Not all ghouls, or even most, are from before the war. But those that remember things like 'national power grids' and 'atomic engineering' are always welcome in Reno! Even if some of them stink."

  new_theincident: "The Incident"

  new_brokenpurge: "The Purge"
  new_brokenpurge_desc: "The attack was devastating. People have suffered radiation, faulty FEV exposure and shrapnel. Even now the outskirts are more than a danger to everyone. Except for us. With the other Families either gone or devastated, we have to take the fight to the Van Graffs. And while we're at it, we will declare martial law and remove all humans from positions of power. We can trust each other not to be Van Graffs, but we cannot trust them."

  new_brokengrowingcircle: "Our Circle Grows"
  new_brokengrowingcircle_desc: "With a firm grip established over New Reno, it has become critical that we look outside of our own circle - after all, there are more mutants out there than Ghouls and Super Mutants, and it is our duty to give them a safe place to live."

  new_brokendarkpit: "An End To Their Dark Pit"
  new_brokendarkpit_desc: "Our troglobiont friends, the Slags, have been forced to huddle in claustrophobic caves for so long. Since we no longer use the Sierra Army Depot, perhaps we could use it as a home for these wayward ghosts?"

  new_brokendownunder: "They Come From A Land Down Under"
  new_brokendownunder_desc: "With the New Underground established, the Slags can now live more comfortably than ever before! With a bright - figuratively, obviously - future ahead of them, they have offered to assist us out of gratitude! We simply have to make a few adjustments to their equipment..."

  new_brokenlivinginasociety: "Living In A Society"
  new_brokenlivinginasociety_desc: "We live in a society, and this is a very good thing! Some Super Mutants responded poorly during their transformation, becoming intellectually-stunted as a result. Since we now have something resembling a government, perhaps we ought to establish institutions to help these poor outliers?"

  new_brokenbadbatch: "The Bad Batch"
  new_brokenbadbatch_desc: "Eureka! Well, sufficiently-so. A few streets and homes burned in the process, but we have managed to cobble together a program promising integration and reformation for disadvantaged Super Mutants. We've already garnered a few admittances, and the rate of attempted cannibalism is lower than ever!"

  new_brokenheartsandminds: "Opening Our Hearts And Minds"
  new_brokenheartsandminds_desc: "Whilst scouring the wastes for other mutants, we found a most peculiar sight - a small party of procyonids, unmistakably organized and sapient, scattering away into the forests as we approached. While the more jester-y of us wanted to dub them 'Furries' we should consider talking to them first, maybe even help them out."

  new_brokenotherkindred: "Our Other Kindred"
  new_brokenotherkindred_desc: "Following further investigation into our new procyonid neighbours, we found ourselves getting on quite well with these 'S'Lanter', odd though they may be. They view us as kindred, and they have come offering us knowledge which may prove useful for our community."

  new_brokendeathclaweggfind: "A Most Peculiar Find"
  new_brokendeathclaweggfind_desc: "Whilst purging the Den of the Mordino's corroding influence, we stumbled upon a most curious treasure - a clutch of Deathclaw eggs, stored in unsightly but technologically-impressive capsules. With the effort put into guarding these, we are already fascinated by the secrets they must conceal."

  new_brokendeadlyclawslovelyhearts: "Deadly Claws, Lovely Hearts"
  new_brokendeadlyclawslovelyhearts_desc: "When the eggs we procured from the Den hatched, it was immediately evident that these were no ordinary Deathclaws - the hatchlings grew rapidly, and soon became the talk of the town when they themselves began to talk. These fascinating new members of our community are a testament to the beauty and diversity of mutants everywhere."

  new_brokenabrighterfuture: "A Brighter Future"
  new_brokenabrighterfuture_desc: "The city is now within safe hands, we must no longer worry about human buffoons running Reno to the ground. We'll bring on a new period of stability to this sinful city. Long live Thradd!"

  new_brokenopeningnewmines: "The NRRB"
  new_brokenopeningnewmines_desc: "The New Reno Reclamation Bureau will offer us centralized means to collect and distribute resources left from the Old World as well as refurbishing its buildings."

  new_brokenfullautomisation: "Full Automatisation"
  new_brokenfullautomisation_desc: "Robots baby! Using dedicated Protectrons for the NRRB will open up a whole new chapter of rebuilding for us."

  new_brokennewerreno: "Newer Reno"

  new_brokenindustrialisation: "Expanded Industrialisation"
  new_brokenindustrialisation_desc: "With the initial steps undertaken we can now modernize the general industry all around Reno, taking yet another step towards the pre-war standard."

  new_brokenrememberbrokenhills: "Remember Broken Hills"
  new_brokenrememberbrokenhills_desc: "Once, our kind had a makeshift idyll - Broken Hills, a place where mutant and man lived somewhat hand-in-hand. Yet, as the uranium dried up and our utility vanished, we were kicked to the wayside, and our arcadia eroded. We will not be stepped on again."

  new_brokenoldworldtactics: "Superiority Of The Old World"
  new_brokenoldworldtactics_desc: "The most distant memories of the oldest of Ghoulkind harken back to an era of unimaginable prosperity and scientific development - an era which still lives on, however faintly, through them. Perhaps it is time that we let these phantoms of memory into the world again."

  new_brokenourmarines: "Our new Old Marines"
  new_brokenourmarines_desc: "A scant few of the old world ghosts which we have chosen to employ remember a more civilized era of warfare - one where the mind bore equal relevancy to the body, and where systems existed that men would not starve or fight without weaponry. Though they may have been buried beneath the sands of time, these tactics, like their masters, are undying."

  new_brokennewworldtactics: "Supremacy Of The New World"
  new_brokennewworldtactics_desc: "The Master taught his children well. Why look back to a past that doomed the world when we can look into the future and use the strengths at hand?"

  new_callinginthebigboys: "Calling in the Big Boys"
  new_callinginthebigboys_desc: "From time to time, there emerges a fleeting story about some bygone scheme of the Master. Few are taken seriously, fewer still hold water. Talk of some abandoned project - hulks larger still even than other mutants - was dismissed accordingly. Still, with some of the new migrants we've received, it tickles the imagination..."

  new_brokenvaultteccalling: "Vault-Tec Calling?"
  new_brokenvaultteccalling_desc: "Vault City has gained our interest for quite some time. Their treatment of humans and mutants is different to say the least. It makes us think about our own treatment of humans as well as a possible combined effort to face the bigger threats out there."

  new_brokenrejecthumanity: "Reject Humanity"
  new_brokenrejecthumanity_desc: "Mankind has stung us time and again, and we have taken the scorpion in our boots with stride. Yet, the Centaur's spines have shattered beneath a straw - it has become evident that man and mutant will never be able to coexist. We will ensure an arcadia for our kind by any means."

  new_brokenreturntosymbiosis: "Return To Symbiosis"
  new_brokenreturntosymbiosis_desc: "The Master taught us that man cannot coexist with mutant, and mankind taught us the same - we will reject these lessons, even if it draws us to our grave. Though we may suffer for it, we shall carve an idyll of acceptance out of the chaos of the city, for harmony is worth our toil."

  new_brokenmutantsmatter: "Mutants Matter"
  new_brokenmutantsmatter_desc: "If the unmutated aren't ready to subordinate to our rule, we will have to crush them."

  new_brokenunityandequality: "Unity and Equality"
  new_brokenunityandequality_desc: "Nothing good could come of turning the sting of rejection from one ensemble of victims to another - if we have learned anything, it is that we should not repeat the mistakes of the past."

  new_gym: "The Gym Rats"
  new_gym_desc: "Established in 2210, the Jungle Gym is now the largest northern facility in northwestern Nevada. It's boxing matches are the stuff of legend, but try our new yoga studio as well. Hot yoga can't be beat, especially if you try the radioactive version!"

  new_slavers:0 "Modoc Slavers Guild"
  new_slavers_desc:0 "Though quite a controversial action, enslaving the people of Modoc would help the Van Graffs out. We can simply take their food for our armies without paying for it, which all agree would be a cost-cutting measure."

  new_denslavers: "Tolerate the Slavers Guild"
  new_denslavers_desc: "The Den's practices may be unsavoury, but they've provided labour to Vault City and others for decades.  Reno is a tolerant community, and we are certainly not going to meddle in local practices."

  new_rainbow_confederation: "The Rainbow Confederation"
  new_rainbow_confederation_desc: "Don't listen to the critics of the Rainbow Raiders - they may have, in the past, been a ruthless gang in California. But today they're a vibrant community who help develop the NCR. Unlike the Legion, we welcome all who can contribute to our shining city on a hill."

  new_ghoul_marriage: "Ghoul Marriage"

  new_economic_convergence: "Economic Convergence"
