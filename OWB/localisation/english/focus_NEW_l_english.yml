  new_littlecity_desc:0 "Before the atomic fire rained from on high? Reno was the biggest little city in the world! But now? Now it might just be the biggest city in the wasteland. To this day, the works and structures that survived the end of the world benefit us."

  new_thefamily:0 "Calling in the Family"
  new_thefamily_desc:0 "Of all the crime 'families' of Reno, ours is the only true family by blood. Reno is a decrepit sinkhole, and it swallowed one of our own whole. Though we were considered the weakest of the families, under our leadership Reno will prosper, and most importantly, be purified."

  new_church:0 "Evangelical Church of New Reno"
  new_church_desc:0 "Constructing churches and schools across Reno would go a long way towards our dream of an idealistic town, no longer a city full of the worst scum of the Wasteland. Dismantling some of the old families' casinos for our churches is also a fitting metaphor for our future."

  new_speakeasies:0 "Reno Speakeasies"
  new_speakeasies_desc:0 "Even the temperate people of our utopian New Reno need a place to relax. Secret trade in alcohol was Orville Wright's trade and led to our prominence as a family, so it only makes sense to build speakeasies across Reno for safe, responsible entertainment."

  new_police:0 "New Reno Police Department"
  new_police_desc:0 "The sinful wasters of Reno haven't taken to our rule well, but through a contact of Christopher Wrights, we have a foolproof plan. A police department made up of FEV-enhanced superhumans would certainly be able to enforce law and order, even in Reno."

  new_criminalworld_desc:0 "Not everything that happens in Reno happens because the men and women on top want it to. It's a free thinking place filled with entrepreneurs who are willing to do just about anything for a handful of caps."

  new_expansionism:0 "Expansionism"
  new_expansionism_desc:0 "Sure, Reno's the biggest little city in the world, but why confine ourselves to a little city? We're a big power in the wastes, and its time that was recognized. Why not expand our borders a little?"

  new_savages:0 "Culling the Savages"

  new_bet:0 "Placing a Bet"

  new_bishop:0 "Bishop to Bc4"
  new_bishop_desc:0 "The patriarch of our family is also one of our greatest assets.

Through his frequent wanders, he has learned to lead troops through the desert."

  new_f3:0 "Queen to F3"
  new_f3_desc:0 "To consolidate our rule over Reno, we will forge an alliance with the Van Graffs - whose ruthlessness and superior tech make them the perfect ally to remove our enemies. Mr Bishop is set to marry into the Van Graffs through their matriarch, Tiaret, in return for their aid."

  new_mordinos_desc:0 "Our family, the Mordinos, was once the most powerful family of Reno, and our tributaries still hold much sway in Reno's dealings. We desire a return to Reno's golden age, where debauchery and addiction swept Nevada."

  new_addictionempire:0 "Addiction Empire"
  new_addictionempire_desc:0 "Though other disreputable families would use violence to enforce their rule, our highly addictive product, Jet, will keep us in power. The Wasteland is a terrifying place, and Jet can provide a temporary distraction."

  new_myron:0 "Myron's Legacy"
  new_myron_desc:0 "Myron was the genius who first developed Jet, after he found that peyote resulted in a longer high and wasn't nearly as addictive. His legacy is the highly addictive, high turnaround super-drug of Jet, which made the Mordinos very rich."

  new_jetbeta:0 "Jet Beta"
  new_jetbeta_desc:0 "Finally, the key to our rule over Reno has been completed. The Beta version of Jet, much more addictive and fully immune to a cure is now finished, and by pumping this out we'll make the whole Wasteland addicts, truly forming our Addiction Empire."

  new_expansion:0 "Van Graff Expansion"
  new_expansion_desc:0 "Allowing the Van Graff family to expand their operations in energy weapon dealing would bring in even more money. In a dangerous place like New Reno, people deserve a little protection."

  new_precautions:0 "Precautions"
  new_precautions_desc:0 "Precautions must be taken in Reno to protect our assets. It is not enough to rely on the peace of our neighbours in such a place as the Wasteland. A great wall must be constructed around New Reno."

  new_radio:0 "New Reno Radio"
  new_radio_desc:0 "Construction radio towers across Reno would be useful both for entertainment, as we can broadcast music, but also as a way of subterfuge and communicating with out mobsters and other armies."

  new_sweatshop:0 "Sweatshop Labour"
  new_sweatshop_desc:0 "The ends justify the means, and sweatshop labour is ultimately extremely efficient. These are wasters and junkies who would die on the streets, at least this way they are employed."

  new_farmsteads:0 "Modoc Farmsteads"
  new_farmsteads_desc:0 "The farmsteads of Modoc are a great source of food for the people of Reno. Investing in their expansion could lead to a higher population in the city as more people prosper and stay fed."

  new_sanctuary:0 "Sanctuary City"

  new_mercmilitary:0 "Merc Military"
  new_mercmilitary_desc:0 "Reno has no standing fighting force, unless you consider the mobsters of the individual families. Instead, they must rely on mercenaries as their armies. The vast wealth of Reno means their merc's contracts last very long, however."

  new_uniques:0 "Unique Mercenaries"
  new_uniques_desc:0 "The leaders of the Reno families have their own special contacts in the mercenary world, and some mercenary armies are more disposed to offer contracts to them. These unique mercenaries often tailor to the specific 'needs' of their families' leader."

  new_thradd:0 "Thradd's Immortals"
  new_thradd_desc:0 "Lead by Thradd the Immortal, a cunning ex-leader in the Master's Army, the Immortals are a band of Super Mutant mercenaries. Undoubtedly one of the most formidable and infamous forces available for hire in the Wasteland, their allegiance is dubious."

  new_gladiators_desc:0 "The Junk City Gladiators are a mercenary army made up entirely of robots, led by an 'erratic', to say the least, captain named Pit Master Frazz. They would be very useful as heavy support."

  new_hedge:0 "Hedged Bets"
  new_hedge_desc:0 "Fortifying the ex-Yakuza territory should be a good enough disincentive for any more raider groups to take refuge in the area. Also, with potential enemies growing in the South and West, it is never bad to hedge your bets."

  new_hordes:0 "Hordes of the North"
  new_hordes_desc:0 "North of Nevada is a cold and barren territory, full of savages and distant powerful threats. With the Antelope Reservation under our control, it is now our first line of defence against the Northern Hordes."

  new_klamathagreements_desc:0 "We aggressively pursued negotiations with the people of Klamath, and eventually an agreement was reached. In exchange for goods and services, Klamath will come under our sphere of control."

  new_takedown:0 "Taking Down the Den"
