  mot_the_battle_for_nipton_desc:0 "The Mojave's raiders and thugs resisted the Republic for too long, and Nipton was the site of one of the greatest battles."

  mot_the_coming_storm:0 "The Coming Storm"
  mot_the_coming_storm_desc:0 "We have heard of a new tribe to the East, under a Scarlet banner. They worship a man called Caesar, and we fear he will come for the Mojave. But how tough could a bunch of tribals be?"
  mot_our_route_home:0 "Tend to the Long 15"
  mot_our_route_home_desc:0 "We cannot leave our supply lines undefended. We must revitalized the prewar road and make sure we are never cut off."
  mot_dealing_with_capitol_hill:0 "Dealing with Capitol Hill"
  mot_dealing_with_capitol_hill_desc:0 "Most of the NCR is behind our expedition, but Senator Allgood and others question this as a pointless waste of lives and resources. We need to manage our home front carefully."
  mot_deploy_the_fresh_battalions:0 "Deploy Fresh Divisions"
  mot_deploy_the_fresh_battalions_desc:0 "New California has over 700,000 citizens. That is plenty to subdue the Mojave with."
  mot_guns_from_back_home:0 "Guns from Back Home"
  mot_guns_from_back_home_desc:0 "Local production in the Mojave is woefully lacking, and so the discrepency must be made up by importing supplies from the Republic."
  mot_form_up_the_first_recon:0 "Form the 1st Recon Battalion"
  mot_form_up_the_first_recon_desc:0 "Chief Hanlon has long impressed the importance of marksmanship on his Ranger Corps, but until now the idea of a dedicated sharpshooter battalion has never gained real traction. In the face of the rough terrain of the Mojave, however, it makes much more sense."
  mot_survey_our_enemy:0 "Survey Our Enemy"
  mot_survey_our_enemy_desc:0 "We must not go blindly into our conflict with the Mojave Brotherhood: it is only through careful observation and calculation that we can determine where and when to strike our enemy hardest. We must expand our observation posts, so the Brotherhood can be crushed once and for all."
  mot_melt_their_steel:0 "Tools to Melt Steel"
  mot_melt_their_steel_desc:0 "It's no secret that Power Armour poses a great threat to our troopers. Most men possess far from the capabilities to pierce the layers of thick, servo-driven armour and kill the Paladins underneath. We must deploy some of the wepaons we found at Navarro, so that at least a fraction of our divisions are able to effectively battle the Brotherhood's Steel Knights."
  mot_strength_in_numbers:0 "Strength in Numbers"
  mot_strength_in_numbers_desc:0 "We possess a key advantage over the Brotherhood: numbers. Even if we lose 8 men to their 1, we'll still be able to wipe them out through numbers alone."
  mot_secure_the_west:0 "Secure the West"
  mot_secure_the_west_desc:0 "Goodsprings, and the road it sits on stretching from the Mojave Outpost to New Vegas, is vital to trade and military deployments in the region. We must ensure it is adequately defended, lest the Brotherhood stike us where it hurts."
  mot_solidify_military_leadership:0 "Appoint Military Staff"
  mot_solidify_military_leadership_desc:0 "We must ensure our military is built on solid foundations before we launch our assault on HELIOS One. Without adequate leadership, we will be ill-prepared to face them down."
  mot_protect_route_95:0 "Protect Route 95"
  mot_protect_route_95_desc:0 "Route 95 is currently our only reliable road to transport supplies through the Mojave to the Hoover Dam and Boulder City. Should it fall to the Brotherhood, these forces in the north would be cut off. We must not let this happen."
  mot_promote_major_moore:0 "Promote Maj. Moore"
  mot_promote_major_moore_desc:0 "Major Cassandra Moore was a Ranger from a young age, serving the Republic loyally as it fought off raiders across California and surviving four tours during the Brotherhood-NCR war. Unfortunately, earlier this year Moore suffered a serious injury whilst garrisoned in the Mojave, meaning she can no longer fight on the fronts. However, she still possess a sharp mind and has a knack for battle tactics. We would be wise to make her a commander."
  mot_make_our_final_preparations:0 "Make Our Final Preparations"
  mot_make_our_final_preparations_desc:0 "Our innevitable assault on the Brotherhood is drawing ever closer, and so we must begin to make out final plans."

  mot_baker_militarisation_act:0 "Petition for the Baker Militarisation Act"
  mot_baker_militarisation_act_desc:0 "While massive military expansions are not technically beyond our remit, the town of Baker is technically still within the NCR. We should petition the NCR Congress for the Baker Militarisation Act, allowing us to bulk up military industry there."
  mot_divert_planners:0 "Divert Our Planning Focus"
  mot_divert_planners_desc:0 "We need to divert a large chunk of our planning efforts to the upcoming war. It may mean we lose some ground in our struggle against the raiders, but so be it."
  mot_local_call_to_arms:0 "A Local Call to Arms"
  mot_local_call_to_arms_desc:0 "Only with the cooperation of the locals will we be able to win the struggle against the Brotherhood. We should issue a patriotic call to arms."
  mot_operation_sunburst:0 "Preempt Political Pressure"
  mot_operation_sunburst_desc:0 "The NCR Congress has been putting intense pressure on us for months to launch a decisive assault against the Mojave Brotherhood. We should launch our assault before the pressure reaches a head, and take the Brotherhood by surprise."
  mot_the_issue_of_the_locals:0 "Towards Pacification"
  mot_the_issue_of_the_locals_desc:0 "Our attempts to pacify the area around the Mojave will take us decades. I guess we may as well make a start..."
  mot_establish_camp_forlorn_hope:0 "Establish Camp Forlorn Hope"
  mot_establish_camp_forlorn_hope_desc:0 "The Forlorn Hope Springs are a strategically vital source of clean water in the Mojave, situated on the plateauing top of a small hill. By establishing a small military outpost, we can secure the water source and protect a portion of Route 95."
  mot_reinforce_camp_spotlight:0 "Reinforce Camp Searchlight"
  mot_reinforce_camp_spotlight_desc:0 "Shortly after the Battle for Nipton, we established Camp Searchlight in the crossroads town bearing the same name. Not only does the camp give us a vantage point over Nipton and Novac, but it also allows us to keep an eye on the Colorado to our East. Expanding the camp will help ensure we can hold onto the region against any who may threaten us."
  mot_the_nipton_deal:0 "The Nipton Deal"
  mot_the_nipton_deal_desc:0 "Nipton was largely untouched by the bombs of the Great War. As a result, a lively community still thrives in and around it: one far too large for us to control through martial law alone. If we were to make a deal with Nipton's Mayor, granting some autonomy in exchange for loyalty, we would gain compliance in the region."
  mot_the_second_campaign:0 "The Second Campaign"
  mot_the_second_campaign_desc:0 "In some ways, two battles need to be fought over the Mojave. The first to occupy the land. The second to win it. We may, de facto, have the Mojave under our ownership, but we are far from controlling swathes of it. The Committee is divided about how best to combat this."
  mot_riches_of_the_mojave:0 "Exploiting the Mojave's Riches"
  mot_riches_of_the_mojave_desc:0 "Although mostly desert plains, the Mojave does possess treasures: if you know where to look."
  mot_the_i40:0 "Clear the I-40"
  mot_the_i40_desc:0 "While our campaign is primarily focused on the Northern Mojave and New Vegas, we must be sure not to forget about the Southern Mojave that lays between Baker and Needles. Much like the Long 15 that leads from Baker to New Vegas, the I-40 remains largely clogged by the wrecks of pre-war cars and trucks. With some work, we would be able to clear the worst of the congestion from the route, making travel to Needles significantly easier."
  mot_been_working_on_the_railway:0 "I've Been Working on the Railroad"
  mot_been_working_on_the_railway_desc:0 "Building a railway from Shady Sands to New Vegas has long been a great dream of General Oliver's. Not only would it be a propaganda victory, but it would also allow for the extremely quick redeployment of troops to New Vegas and the Hoover Dam from the NCR's heartland. The first part of the line, running from Baker alongside the Long 15, is relatively easy to construct due to our strong control over the area. Running a line through the Mojave, meanwhile, may be a bit more of an issue..."
  mot_cottonwood_port:0 "Bulk Up the Cottonwood Port"
  mot_cottonwood_port_desc:0 "Whilst the Long 15 acts as our main trade route back to the NCR, we could also run small-scale supply missions up the Colorado, from NCR outposts to the South. It wouldn't be ideal, but it may be useful in emergencies"
  mot_garrison_primm:0 "Garrison Primm"
  mot_garrison_primm_desc:0 "A pre-war mini-Vegas, Primm has experienced something of a resurgence following NCR occupation of the Mojave. A key trading town on the route to New Vegas, Primm is a strategic location well worth defending: indeed, should Nipton fall it could become a vital rally point."
  mot_bittersprings:0 "March on Bittersprings"
  mot_bittersprings_desc:0 "For years the tribal raiders who call themselves the 'Great Khans' have plagued our territory. Based to the East of Vegas, in their camp known as 'Bittersprings', they think themselves safe from repurcussion. It's time to put an end to their foolery."
  mot_bittersprings_march_tt:0 "§gIt will take our soldiers a few days to march through the outskirts of New Vegas to launch their raid on Bittersprings. We'll recieve word when the commence their attack.§!"
  mot_act_now:0 "Act Now Or Forever Hold Our Peace"
  mot_act_now_desc:0 "The clash at Hoover Dam has left us jarred. We don't know how long we'll be able to hold on to the Mojave, but we need to assume the answer may not be forever. We need to hurry up and extract resources from the area, before it's too late."
  mot_the_bulls_soft_bellow:0 "The Bull's Growing Bellows"
  mot_the_bulls_soft_bellow_desc:0 "The Legion swells like cancer across the East. We must be ready."
  mot_assemble_the_mojave_defence_committee:0 "Assemble the Mojave Defence Committee"
  mot_assemble_the_mojave_defence_committee_desc:0 "The Mojave, or its population and strategic centres at least, now lie almost completely under our grasp. We now need to concern ourselves with keeping it that way. Enemies lie all around us, and there is some division within our ranks about how we should best prepare for future battles."
  mot_the_old_world_wall:0 "The Old World Wall"
  mot_the_old_world_wall_desc:0 "The Old World Wall: the Hoover Dam. For centuries it has stood as a testament to American engineering prowess, and has produced power for close to a dozen generations of American families. However, it possesses a critical flaw: it's appallingly indefensible. Whilst the original designers could be excused for not anticipating a battle fought on it's concrete, their shortsightedness has become something of a issue for the Defence Committee. Decisions are needed."
  mot_emergency_ctte_divide:0 "Emergency Committee: The Great Divide"
  mot_emergency_ctte_divide_desc:0 "Should something happen in the Divide to our supply routes, we will have to rapidly convene the Committee to decide on future strategy."
  mot_emergency_ctte_vegas:0 "Emergency Committee: The Fall of New Vegas"
  mot_emergency_ctte_vegas_desc:0 "Should New Vegas fall to powers unwilling to uphold the Treaty of New Vegas, the Committee must be convened to decide on our plan of response."
  mot_revisiting_the_treaty:0 "Revisiting the Treaty of New Vegas"
  mot_revisiting_the_treaty_desc:0 "While the Treaty of New Vegas pledged 95% of Hoover Dam's energy to the NCR, as well as military access for NCR troopers to most of New Vegas, the treaty was a begrudging compromise with a nation the NCR would much rather just annex in its entirity. Sadly, the years of peace have only increase Mr House's strength, while the NCR continues to flounder in the Mojave. If we are to one day rule the Mojave, we must have a plan."
  mot_call_up_second_draft:0 "Call Up the Second Draft"
  mot_call_up_second_draft_desc:0 "Whatever advantage Mr House thinks he may possess in Securitrons, the NCR more than makes up for in good quality fighting men and women. We should call for a second draft of citizens from the NCR: and with any luck, some of them will be deployed to help us."
  mot_family_diplomacy:0 "Family Diplomacy"
  mot_family_diplomacy_desc:0 "Divide and conquer. That's the tactic the loony dictator across the Colorado is always preaching about. If we were to work with some of the Vegas' families and organisations, we may be able to peel some support of Mr House, significantly weakening his grip over his prize jewel."
  mot_an_encouraging_victory:0 "An Encouraging Victory"
  mot_an_encouraging_victory_desc:0 "Our defeat of the stuck-up Brotherhood bastards in the Mojave has been a great boost to our standing amongst the NCR's people, and the government in shady sands. Needles to say, we can exploit this victory for more supplies."
  mot_lessons_from_the_war:0 "Lessons from War"
  mot_lessons_from_the_war_desc:0 "Whilst we were ultimately successful in our war against the Mojave Brotherhood sparked by Operation: Sunburst, it has taught us some much-needed lessons about our military tactics. We must adapt if we are to survive."
  mot_tools_left_behind:0 "Use the Tools Left Behind"
  mot_tools_left_behind_desc:0 "It seems the Brotherhood was tinkering about inside HELIOS One, presumably to restore its capacity as a power generating solar array. Our attack clearly caught them in the middle of their ambition, and as a result there's a number of pre-war tools inside the complex. Our engineers at the Hoover Dam would surely greatly appreciate it if we sent these their way."
  mot_the_heavy_corps:0 "Form the Heavy Corps"
  mot_the_heavy_corps_desc:0 "With the basic understanding of power armour we possess, we may be able to strip down the power armour recovered from Operation: Sunburst and train our men to use it. Heavily armoured assets will be invaluable against any primitive foe."
  mot_restoring_hoover:0 "Restoring the Hoover Dam"
  mot_restoring_hoover_desc:0 "The Dam has long been running at a mere fraction of its potential capacity. With some serious work, we could drastically upscale the power production of the plant."
  mot_horrors_in_vault_3:0 "Horrors in Vault 3"
  mot_horrors_in_vault_3_desc:0 "We may control most of the Mojave, but one area remains beyond our control: Vault 3 and its surroundings. The Fiends, a vicious raider gang that once operated over most of the Mojave, holds it in an iron grasp. If we are to purge them from the wastes once and for all, we need to decide an overarching strategy."
  mot_consiglieres_diplomacy:0 "Consilglieres Diplomacy"
  mot_consiglieres_diplomacy_desc:0 "The Fiends are one of the founding families of New Vegas, but splinters from their family still inhabit Vault 3, and cling true to their raider ways. By doing a deal with Mr House and the Consilglieres, we could offer to remove this embarasing stain on the family and isolate them in Vault 3. We'll be avoiding a direct war, but the local area will be plagued by the Fiends for a while to come."
  mot_pushing_them_back:0 "Push Back the Scum"
  mot_pushing_them_back_desc:0 "We must dislodge the Fiends from the various harpoints they occupy in the North-West of the Mojave. We may not be able to crack Vault 3 itself, but we can at least mostly contain them if they're forced back into it."
  mot_victory_at_the_dam:0 "Victory at the Dam"
  mot_victory_at_the_dam_desc:0 "We have been successful in fending off the assault by Caesar's Legion on the Dam and Boulder City. It wasn't pretty, and it was more down to luck then we'd like to admit, but it's a victory."
  mot_the_long_march_home:0 "The Long March Home"
  mot_the_long_march_home_desc:0 "Despite the best efforts of our generals and countless NCR troopers, the Dam has fallen to a Legion assault. We must now make the long march home, and make some tough decisions about our future."
  mot_supply_and_demand:0 "Supply and Demand"
  mot_supply_and_demand_desc:0 "The Mojave is vast and desolate. To properly control it, we require a number of military bases crisscrossing the region, each requiring constant supply and reinforcement. Whilst we may have about enough supplies to keep our current outposts ticking over, if we are to expand our outposts, construct new ones or sufferer enemy espionage we may be unable to provide enough supplies to all our bases."
  mot_first_supply_shipment:0 "The First Supply Shipment"
  mot_first_supply_shipment_desc:0 "Delivered along the newly construced line from Baker to the Mojave Outpost, our first shipment of supplies from Shady Sands should keep us ticking over on supply nicely."
  mot_the_mojave_line:0 "The Mojave Line"
  mot_the_mojave_line_desc:0 "A long-term ambition of the NCR senate has been to contruct a railway line connecting the NCR proper to New Vegas. The railway serves two purposes: both to bring trade quickly and efficiently to New Vegas, and to assist in the rapid redeployment of NCR troopers to the Mojave as needed."
  mot_the_mojave_line_tt:0 "Construction of a railroad joining the Long 15 to New Vegas will begin construction, using labour from the NCR correctional facility. What could go wrong?\n\n"
  mot_reinforce_forlorn_hope:0 "Reinforce Camp Forlorn Hope"
  mot_reinforce_forlorn_hope_desc:0 "Despite its rather dreary name, Camp Forlorn Hope is one of our chief outposts and observation points against Legion expansion. Should it fall, our forces will be effectively split in two along Route 95. If we have the supply to spare, beefing up the camp's defences would be well worth the cost."
  mot_reinforce_searchlight:0 "Reinforce Camp Searchlight"
  mot_reinforce_searchlight_desc:0 "Camp Searchlight, nesteld in the prosperous village of Searchlight and near the Colorado River, is a strategically vital military hardpoint. While we anticipate the major thrust of the Legion's attack will come across the Hoover Dam, it may also be possible that an attempt is made to cross the Colorado on our southern flank, near Searchlight. This cannot be allowed to happen."
  mot_camp_maccaren_primacy:0 "Camp McCarren Primacy"
  mot_camp_maccaren_primacy_desc:0 "While our military HQ has always been, de jure, Baker, Camp McCarren has become our major supply depot and outpost in the northern Mojave wastelands. It is time to officially move our Military HQ to the Camp."
  mot_live_and_let_live:0 "Live and Let Live"
  mot_live_and_let_live_desc:0 "We simply don't have the time nor the resources to deal with the \"Power Gangers\" and their breakout from the NCR correctional facility outside Goodsprings. We need the men elsewhere."
  mot_liv_and_let_live_tt:0 "When we go to war, the "Powder Gangers" harass our supply lines. But it's worth it for now, right?"
  mot_operation_rollup:0 "Begin Operation Roll Up"
  mot_operation_rollup_desc:0 "The thought of a \"fifth column\" within our territory is simply intolerable. We cannot allow the Powder Gangers to continue to terrorise the western Mojave freely, as they are currently doing in Goodsprings and Primm. These settlements must be brought into the fold, one way or the other."
  mot_ranger_stations_on_i40:0 "Ranger Stations on the I-40"
  mot_ranger_stations_on_i40_desc:0 "The I-40 serves a vital military purpose as one of our only redeployment routes in the event of an attack. By establishing a number of checkpoints manned by members of the Ranger Corps along the road, we can be sure it remains as safe as possible from Legion attacks."
  mot_integration_of_primm:0 "Integrate Primm"
  mot_integration_of_primm_desc:0 "Primm has long remained just outside our reach. Due to a lack of manpower and general ambivalence, the NCR has never made a concerted attempt to integrate the region. If we were to install an NCR Sherrif in the town, taking advantage of the chaos caused by the Powder Gangers, we could surely bring the town into our fold."
  mot_liberate_goodsprings:0 "Liberate Goodsprings"
  mot_liberate_goodsprings_desc:0 "One of the first targets of the Powder Gangers was Goodsprings, a prosperous little trading town on the western route to New Vegas. It has suffered much under the tyrannical rule of petty Powder Ganger warlords, and they would surely be grateful for NCR troopers to provide them with saftey and security."
  mot_clean_out_nipton:0 "Clean Out Nipton"
  mot_clean_out_nipton_desc:0 "Nipton was granted a measure of autonomy during the early days of the Mojave Campaign, due to its size and relatively insignificant location. However, it has grown to become a hive of scum and villany after the Powder Gangers arrived, specialising in smuggling and prostitution. We must establish order in the settlement, if we are to ever exercise a measure of control over the area."
  mot_appoint_ambassador_crocker:0 "Appoint Ambassador Crocker"
  mot_appoint_ambassador_crocker_desc:0 "Following Ambassador Edith's retriement earlier this year from her role as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the NCR Embassy in New Vegas, we need to find a suitable replacement. Under political pressure from Shady Sands, it seems we have only one possible candidate: Dennis Crocker. A career politician, Crocker led Kimball's successful campaign to sit on the NCR council. He at least seems a competent diplomat."
  infantry_weapons_bonus:0 "Infantry Weapons Bonus"
  mot_an_offer:0 "An Offer..."
  mot_an_offer_desc:0 "We can make a proposal for Benny to work with us, if the price is right. Surely he will not stab us in the back and end his days on a Legion cross?"
  mot_an_offer_tt:0 "If Benny is not in power, he will launch a coup with our support should we fight New Vegas. If he is in power, we can come to some sort of arrangement."

  mot_mp_deployments:0 "Deploy the Military Police"
  mot_mp_deployments_desc:0 "The NCR's reputation is perpetually tarnished by rowdy, drunk and generally disobedient NCR troopers spening all their wages on the New Vegas strip. While we can do little to restrict NCR troopers from spending their money on hookers and drugs, we can at least police those who get too unruly. Besides, our military police are the only units on the Strip allowed to carry firearms, so if Mr House gets a little too uppity..."
  mot_the_great_debate:0 "The Great Debate"
  mot_the_great_debate_desc:0 "For the months following the Battle for Hoover Dam, the Mojave Defence Committee has endlessly debated our strategy. Praise has landed on both Oliver's and Hanlon's heads, but so has extensive critisism. Discontent within the Committee is coming to a head, and only one of the two influental characters can lead the Expedition forwards."
  mot_promote_chief_hanlon:0 "General Oliver's Resignation"
  mot_promote_chief_hanlon_desc:0 "The Mojave Defence Committee has made its decision, and the majority of its members back Hanlon over Oliver. As a result Oliver has chosed to resign his position of General of the Mojave Expedition, and has reccomended Hanlon takes the title instead. At Hanlon's behest, however, Oliver will continue serving as a Field Marshal in the Mojave"
  mot_cement_olivers_authority:0 "Cement Oliver's Authorty"
  mot_cement_olivers_authority_desc:0 "Despite the posibility of a challenge from Hanlon, General Oliver has suceeded in retaining the confidence of the Mojave Defence Committee. The victory of his policy choices at recent Committee meetings has solidified his authority, ensuring he will continue to command the Expedition going forwards."
  mot_a_shared_vision:0 "A Shared Vision"
  mot_a_shared_vision_desc:0 "Despite many of their tactical differences, Hanlon and Oliver both share strategic visions for the Mojave, especially when it comes to competing with the Legion away from the Dam. Together, they make a formidable strategic team."
  mot_baja_redeployments:0 "Baja Redeployments"
  mot_baja_redeployments_desc:0 "The Baja peninsula has fielded one of the most bloody conflicts the NCR has found itself involved in. Numerous divisions of NCR troopers and Rangers have been deployed to the region, where they face harsh terrain and an insurgent enemy. Those that survive emerge as grizzled veterans: the kind of veterans the Mojave Expedition needs."

  mot_trouble_from_under_black_mount:0 "Trouble from Black Mountain"
  mot_trouble_from_under_black_mount_desc:0 "Black Mountain has for years been broadcasting a strange, garbled radio signal. Likely the work of a lunatic with a radio antenna, we've more or less ignored the broadcast: until NCR patrols started going missing near the are. It's time for us to send a division to establish the truth about Black Mountain."

  mot_the_hardpoint_gambit:0 "The Hardpoint Gambit"
  mot_the_hardpoint_gambit_desc:0 "The final act of Hanlon's Warplan Bastion is the abandonment of the Western and Central Mojave to local settlements. While this drastically decreases our control of these regions, and opens the possibility for a raider resurgence, it means we can almost exclusively focus our military forces along the Colorado to face the Legion straight on. It's a gamble, but it just might pay off."

The settlement initially acted as a staging point for our expedition, as well as a central supply hub. Over time, most of these duites gradually transfered over to Camp McCarren, leaving Baker as more of a manufacturing settlement than a military HQ.

  mot_more_than_two_at_the_table_desc:0 "It seems we have understimated the strength of New Vegas. Should we not be careful, we could find ourselves at war with a third party over the Hoover Dam. Our troops are barely enough to hold off the NCR as it is: we could not hold against a combined Vegas-Legion assault. However, we should begin planning for one..."

  mot_hoover_fob_desc:0 "The Hoover Dam is our primary strategic objective in the Mojave, and must be defended as such. By converting some of the visitors centre into a military planning base, we can more effectively control any battle that breaks out for the Dam. Ah, who am I kidding. We can more effectively control the battle that will break out for the Dam."

  mot_horror_of_vault_three_desc:0 "Vault Three, once populated by vault dwellers but long ago conquered by the Fiends in a bloody battle, is the seat of Motor Runner's power. His drugged-up followers constantly harrass Camp McCarren and our patrols, while they simultaneously hook the NCR's citizens on all manners of crude drugs. The standing orders so far have been to hold the line against the Fiends, but it is time for that to change. We can't face a two-front conflict in the Mojave."

  mot_brotherhood_diplomacy_desc:0 "While we had long suspected some fragment of the Brotherhood survived Operation Sunburst, we did not expect quite so significant a portion of the Chapter to have survived under stict lockdown in Hidden Valley's bunker network.

Based in the old Nellis AFB, north of New Vegas, they have access to a significant amount of pre-war military tech: including artillery pieces and even a pre-war bomber. Their manpower and technology would be invaluable in defending Hoover Dam, if we can get a message to them."
