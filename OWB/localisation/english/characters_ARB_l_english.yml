  ARB_VANGUARD_NAME:0 "Viscount O'Brien"
  ARB_VANGUARD_DESC:0 "Conniving and ruthless, O'Brien rose from the ranks of have-nothing wasteland guns-for-hire to lead his own mercenary outfit by the age of 21. After an unbroken string of successes on the battlefields of northern Canada, he was approached by servants of the Manitoba crown with an unresistable offer. Rally the failed forces of monarchists and counter-revolutionaries fleeing from Three Rivers, turn the tide, and crush the fledgling Republic. In return, he'll be granted the title of Viscount and control over the sizable stretch of land to rule as he sees fit under the auspices of the throne. \n\n He runs the Junta in Arborg as his personal army, squeezing every last bit of cap and scrap from the settlements in the region to build his military forces and fund expeditions for Pre-War tech. Self-assured in his victory, after the inevitable assault against Three Rivers he'll secure a life of luxury and a place in the history books with one fell swoop."
