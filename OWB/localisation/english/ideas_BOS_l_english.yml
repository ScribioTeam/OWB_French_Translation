  bos_civilian_distrust_desc: "The NCR-Brotherhood war has left many people in the greater NCR hostile to the idea of Brotherhood rule. This isn't exclusively their fault, as Lost Hills typically avoided humanitarian efforts on the \"civilians loyal to the enemy\" during that conflict."

  bos_tension_dynamic_modifier_desc: "We have only recently been able to broker our unofficial ceasefire with the NCR. Many in the Brotherhood fear that this 'peace' won't last long. Tension for us reflects how as the idea of reigniting this conflict raises members of Lost Hills begin abandoning their doctrinal duties in order to prepare for war with the great enemy."

  bos_ncr_tension_dynamic_modifier_desc: "For many policy makers, the prospect of a full campaign against the Brotherhood terrorists in the mountains to the west of the Hub just isn't tenable right now. The destruction of the NCR Gold Reserve has shown how much damage the Brotherhood can do to the NCR with targeted, calculated strikes. With the campaign in the Mojave and enemies abound the last thing the Brahmin Barons, Allgood or anyone else wants is bloodshed so close to the core territories.\nThe Brotherhood's time will come. The question, however, is when."

  #The advisor contest!
BOS_advisor_contest_name_1: "Scribe Campbell Wright"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_1_desc: "Once a low ranking scribe Wright spent much of his free time in the Lost Hills archives where he read up on the aircraft that once dominated the skies of the old world. One such vehicle that captured his attention was that of the Airship. While many in the Old World had considered it an outdated technology Wright could see it still had potential. He drew up plans for streamlined airships that could be easily constructed with the resources the Brotherhood had access to. These airships would allow the Brotherhood to send out expeditions to the far off locales of Texas, the East Coast, and the Midwest. Wright, now considered the Brotherhood's expert on aircraft, looks to take back the skies with steel behemoths that even the old world would look at in awe."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_2: "Knight Henry Muñoz"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_2_desc: "Knight Muñoz's grandfather joined the Brotherhood after crash-landing a homemade plane near Lost Hills. While Henry is no ace pilot, he has shown an aptitude for building aircraft instead, often finding tweaking engines and exhaust simultaneously to ensure everything can keep running."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_3: "Knight Archibald"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_3_desc: "During battle, stacked odds often mean defeat for those against them. However, Archibald has learned that such a thing can easily be disavowed with some good leadership and laughter in the face of the enemy. Born to parents within the Brotherhood, Archibald grew up recognising all different depressing and gruesome manners that the Wastes had to offer when out on patrol for technology. However, even as a youngling, Archibald cracked a joke in these situations, in order to keep spirits high for his team, even if they all lived in this bleak world. To the many new up and coming faces in the Brotherhood, Archibald is seen as a bulwark to whatever the Wastes can throw at people, be it physically or mentally. To his superiors, he is seen as a soldier that has learnt how to lead his team in both battle and out of it. To his enemies, his laughter and smile are usually the last thing their senses pick up on."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_4: "Knight Malphas"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_4_desc: "Malphas was never quite the same after his expedition to the forests to the northeast of Arroyo. His face was different, he had a different skin color and even seemed to forget his own family. Nonetheless, he was always a good soldier despite the trauma he has undergone. Employing raw cunning and a ruthless understanding of the West Coast he has led many scouting attempts that have been rather lucrative for Lost Hills."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_5: "Paladin Migil"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_5_desc: "During the battle of Irvine, brotherhood soldiers discovered power armor design for excavation. After being returned to Lost Hills Bunker, Paladin Migil found a new purpose in life. Migil is the only paladin with the fascination of digging and mining to almost an addiction, claiming it is a natural desire for him to be underground. He initially had issues with the sizing of the suit. While he is stout, never call him a dwarf!"
BOS_advisor_contest_name_6: "Scribe J. Beatrice Goodenough"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_6_desc: "Niece to the former Head Scribe of the Order of the Shield, following her parents death she was largely entrusted to family friends. While regimented and organized as a general rule, the brotherhood in the case of Jane allowed her a great deal of autonomy in her extra curricular time. Without parents to remand her to, and her Uncle's prestige Jane was given largely free reign to tinker and experiment on whatever project was not urgent or closely monitored. With power cells and other radioactive materials kept under lock and key Jane was constantly stymied by her inability to power her latest gadget. Swiping previously declared dead batteries and cores from the recyclers Jane jury-rigged and hotwired to eke out every bit of juice. When the time came that she had developed something she wished to show to her Uncle it came as a surprise to her, the power supply modifications which had come to her so intuitively were so lauded. Now as the years have gone by Senior Scribe Goodenough has been given the full support of the Order to tinker as she wills."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_7: "Scribe Lamont"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_7_desc: "Scribe Lexi Ramonett rose to prominence within the Brotherhood through her innate fixation with logistics. Having grown up obsessed with old pip boy games and listening to the old recordings on the database has given her an innate advantage in such regards. As a vocal critic of NCR Expansionism, Scribe Ramonett seeks nothing more than to put her skills to use in a full scale war against the NCR proving brotherhood superiority once and for all."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_8: "Scribe Schreber"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_8_desc: ""Essayons!" Scribe Schreber has always been an Engineer first. Brought into the Brotherhood as a child orphan raised in Lost Hills. Scribe Schreber has some suspected Enclave roots. Being found as a child wandering the wastes alone outside of Navarro. After the fall of Navarro in 2246. His loyalty is not in doubt though. He is very devoted to the cause and the brotherhood that took him in as a child. Fascinated by the inner working and the pure destructive power of Power Armor. Scribe Schreber often ranges outside of Lost Hills. Accompanying scavenging teams and patrols onto pre war military bases littering the West Coast. Extracting schematics and modifications on prewar Power Armor."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_9: "Paladin Bernardo Gomez de Aguafresca"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_9_desc: "A descendent of a Mexican immigrant that served in the national guard before the war, Bernardo Gomez de Aguafresca has grown in a family close to the ruling élites of the brotherhood. He quickly reached the upper echelons of his chapter thanks to the influence of his parents and to his loyalty toward the brotherhood. He fought during the conflicts with the Enclave and the NCR, and realized that the brotherhood wasn't strong enough to destroy a giant such as the two-headed bear. Since then, he advocates for a moderated approach to external relationships, and upholds the importance of focusing on internal affairs instead of confrontation with other nations. He's a staunch isolationist, as he views non-intervention as the only way for the brotherhood to survive."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_10: "Scribe Zach"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_10_desc: "Formerly a small arms repairman in the NCR Army; despite several years of service, Zach Hazard never advanced beyond his initial rank of Specialist. This was why he left and joined the Brotherhood; that, and there's only so many times you could fix a rifle that has been slammed in the doors of buildings before questioning the competency of your fellow soldiers. As a scribe, Zach found himself doing the same thing that he has been doing for the last few years. At least this time he doesn't have to deal with people breaking their guns in the weirdest ways possible."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_11: "Knight Domitius"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_11_desc: "Was born in the legion and after years of harsh training and suffering under the legions of Cesar, he decided to flee west with his family after a long march they found the Brotherhood, and all the good they provided but all the bad that came with it, So Aurelianus joined the ranks and Rapidly went up the ranks, with his scars of battle and his strategic genius, Him and his few Power armor troopers could easily flank and destroy enemy legions from the back or if needed from the front as the wall that would stop the enemy hordes, To distinct himself in the bunker He would paint his mask with a golden color."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_12: "Paladin Higuchi"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_12_desc: "A former member of the Yakuza, the young Higuchi left the group following disagreements over ethics and incorporating advanced technology reached a boiling point. Wanting to be more than as he saw, a “savage bandit”, Higuchi wandered the North California wastes picking up any weapons, armor, or technology he deemed important; all culminating in Higuchi constructing his own makeshift power armor, and becoming something of a one man army. Although he ended up losing, the knights were impressed with Higuchi’s fighting prowess, eventually - through the usual trials that an outsider would undergo - joining the Brotherhood of Steel."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_13: "Scribe Dolores"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_13_desc: "Born inside the secure walls of the Lost Hills bunker, Dolores grew up without seeing the outside world, except few trips outside with her father. In one such trip, the entire detachment, including her father, got ambushed by the NCR forces and were subsequently killed. Even though she narrowly escaped this experience scarred her for life. She could no longer go outside without being paralysed by fear. Getting demoted for insubordination, she was offered the rank of scribe as a last resort. There she found many old world books about psychology ignored by the Brotherhood for not having military value. As she studied them, she saw the psychological toll of the war in the Brotherhood's psyche. Now, she does more than just mending broken weapons, she mends the broken psyche of the Brotherhood."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_14: "Scribe Ferry"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_14_desc: "Unlike other Scribes, Guido Ferry was not too interested in technology. Instead, he focused on trying to recreate cuisine of the Old World, using the ingredients of the New. While some question his obsession with Old World cuisine, no one can deny his cooking skills are useful on long deployments… and for recruitment."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_15: "Scribe Louise"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_15_desc: "One of the few wastelanders to be recruited into the brotherhood, Scribe Louise presented herself at an outpost with holodisks containing valuable information including blueprints and bunker locations. When brought in for questioning after helping secure these bunkers, she impressed the High Elder with her understanding of technology and the danger it holds for mankind, a belief she still holds albeit with more empathy towards the average wastelander."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_16: "Iverna Shin"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_16_desc: "Iverna is the granddaughter of one Daniel Shin, whose Brotherhood Scrolls indicate that he left on an expedition a region known as "Appalachia" as part of the "Brotherhood First Expeditionary Force" in 2103. However, records after the force's departure conflict with one another, with some records claiming that Daniel Shin was forced to return, leaving Appalachia in the hands of a rogue operative, and other records stating that Shin stayed in Appalachia for the rest of his days, only being able to contact Lost Hills to provide a situation report at the end of his life. Despite the conflicting reports, Iverna seeks to maintain a different persona and worldview than her grandfather once did, seeking the path of peace and technological progress, despite the ongoing NCR-Brotherhood War. She especially seeks to differ in her grandfather's ways by seeking to make peace or otherwise invoke non-aggression pacts with any encountered raider gangs, as a form of contrasting Daniel Shin's hatred of raiders."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_17: "Knight Corbin"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_17_desc: "With such a vast territory to watch, any army would struggle to maintain control. Companies would have to return to base often, rearming and resting while another takes its place on patrol. Logistics become a nightmare in such a scenario. Knight Corbin saw such a problem and dealt with the situation. After several attacks on supply convoys that were destined for Outpost 36 near Irvine, Corbin found his patrol without anything. Rather than needlessly defending a base that was lost, Corbin set out with his men to conduct a guerilla occupation. Learning from the raiders, Corbin scavenged the land for all necessary supplies, conducted surgical strikes, and sent the raiders running. Such warfare was considered below most Brotherhood tacticitions for any prolonged war, but one night Corbin remembered what he learned from his battles; a small band that can scavenge can take down any foe, no matter their technological prowess or their resource pool."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_18: "Paladin Roberts"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_18_desc: "A true blue Brotherhood patriot, Paladin Roberts eagerly rose through the ranks of the Order of the Shield as soon as he was of age. Eventually he was given command of Fort Bastion, an outpost on the border of Brotherhood territory. After being injured during a skirmish with raiders, Roberts has returned to Lost Hills to serve in an advisory role to the Elders."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_19: "Scribe Reyes"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_19_desc: "Scribe Angela Reyes is an experienced and accomplished scout for the Brotherhood who is an expert in navigating the wastes. Raised in the Lost Hills Bunker but drawn to the outdoors, Reyes dreamt of experiencing something beyond the monotony of bunker life. Starting as a mere novice in the Brotherhood's vast scouting network, Reyes rose through the ranks and over time became an effective manager of spies, rogues and traders. Their time managing and supplying Brotherhood scouts across the wasteland has made them proficient in handling logistics and getting supplies where they would otherwise struggle to reach."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_20: "Scribe Vree III"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_20_desc: "Scribe Vree IV comes from a long and proud line of brotherhood scribes known for their ability to produce and improve upon energy weapons, with some of their prototypes even outdoing pre-war energy weapons. Despite how large the shoes she needs to fill are, Vree has proven herself to perhaps be even better than the rest of her lineage, with her technical knack for pre-war equipment that few could outpace! With her on your board of advisors, you can expect to get better energy weapons sooner."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_21: "Paladin Warwick"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_21_desc: "A shining example of the rigidity and strictness of the Brotherhood's officer corps, Paladin Warwick is an old school officer within the brotherhood's military. His excessive disdain for outsiders and extreme harshness has made him an unpopular officer, though an effective one. He demands strict discipline from his men and is known amongst the lower ranks as "Wash it again Warwick" for his fixation on maintenance and cleaning standards."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_22: "Paladin Hardy"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_22_desc: "Scribe Wilbur would describe himself as lucky. Lucky to be born into the brotherhood, lucky to be found intelligent enough to join the scribes, lucky to even be alive after his first mission left him the sole survivor of his time out of the bunker. However, though he thought his luck had finally run out after his first mission, it turned out that his lucky streak was just beginning. After days of wandering the wastes, trying to find his way back to Lost Hills, he stumbled upon an old research station where old America had been on the verge of finding a way to truly mass produce America's finest creation: Power Armor. A few days of combing through this database, downloading everything he could, a small rescue team had finally found him. Instead of a sobbing mess some of the knights expected to find him in, they found a man grinning ear to ear as he held up a bag filled with old world knowledge. Wilbur has now made it his life's goal to see these old prototypes and concepts brought to life."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_23: "Rhombus IV"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_23_desc: "Allegedly the fourth of his name, Rhombus IV expected a major legacy to live up to, due to being the fourth of a highly prestigious name within the Brotherhood. However, due to the NCR-Brotherhood War, as well as the lack of Codex or Scroll records on what happened to Rhombus after the Brotherhood's interaction with the legendary Vault Dweller, Rhombus IV's lineage is seen as dubious throughout the Council of Elders. Rhombus IV serves much like his alleged grandfather did over a century before, seeking to become the Head Paladin and Head Knight of the Lost Hills Brotherhood. Much like his great-grandfather, Rhombus IV maintains a stern, stoic, gruff personality, having the added challenges of living up to a legacy that many throughout the Bunker believe may have never existed. However, his combat and technical prowess, as well as his personality, make him an excellent asset in both tactical planning and frontline combat."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_24: "Scribe Markus "Bleeding" Heart"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_24_desc: "Markus was born in Lost hills to a pair of scribes, shortly after his eleventh birthday he would learn his parents, while on patrol, would unfortunately be taken hostage and killed by a group of desperate wastelanders. While many considered this further evidence that isolation from the outside remained necessary, Markus instead felt empathy for the wastelanders, whose only option was to harm others for a chance at food. The continued voicing of his ideas has repeatedly led to his receiving of disciplinary warnings and earned him his nickname, a reference to his ideas and surname, and his nose after one officer had enough of his preaching."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_25: "Knight Cora"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_25_desc: "Cora, unlike many of the other initiates, held some fundamentals of leadership. She was naturally charismatic, she could talk the Power Armor off of a paladin. She wasn't just a run of the mill silver tongued individual, she was a leader. A natural at taking the worst trained people, and coming out on top against the best trained team. She spent a lot of her time with the initiates, ensuring they had everything they needed. She thought the rigid rules of the Brotherhood limited their growth, and these barriers needed to be reformed, or torn down. She relished the opportunity to leave the dank and musty halls of the bunker. Any time she was on patrol or otherwise outside, she gave drinking water and scraps of bread to those less fortunate."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_26: "Knight Adam Syx"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_26_desc: "Senior Knight Adam Syx has been a member of the Brotherhood through several family generations. As an Apprentice Knight he proved himself a quick mind after taking charge in a trading expedition into New Californian territory. Upon his return he brought a vast amount of innovations to all aspects of industry. Through many following years in the Brotherhood he rose to the rank of Senior Knight, and now helms commerce and industrial research for Lost Hills."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_27: "Scribe Hamilton"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_27_desc: "Having traveled to many chapters scattered across the wastes Hamilton has come to understand power armor on a level not many have. From ways to cut down production of parts and the addition of new modifications to existing suits. While not the most popular individual due to his extensive travels and lack of hostility to outsiders, the now dedicated scribe oversees his duties with the expertise one would expect of him."
BOS_advisor_contest_name_28: "Scribe Hutchinson"
BOS_advisor_contest_advisor_28_desc: ""I'm a scribe not a soldier!" Raised in the relative comfort of Lost Hills. Hutchinson typically finds himself treating day to day minor ailments and performing pre war medical procedures that couldn't be found anywhere else. Outside of places like Vault City. Commonly seen as a rabble rouser in Lost Hills for his support of Outsiders inclusion into the Brotherhood ranks. Scribe Hutchinson missed being sent on expeditions East. For being the subject matter expert in all matters medical related for Lost Hills. An expertise proving him invaluable in maintaining the longevity and health of the Lost Hills."
