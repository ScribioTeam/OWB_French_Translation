  nf_two.1.t:0 "Tucson Legacy"
  nf_two.1.d:0 "Before the war, Tucson was the second largest city in Arizona, rivalled only by Phoenix. That small size made for an advantage when the bombs fell as it; as fire rained from the skies on metropolises across America, nobody spared a thought for a direct strike on the second-largest city in one big desert. Of course, this knowledge did little to ease the minds of its inhabitants; in the panic that followed the world's end, entire sections of the city were destroyed. Great fires, fueled by nuclear winds, threatened to consume Tucson whole. Miraculously, one part of the city managed to escape destruction, despite all the chaos and the quickly expanding flames; it was Tucson's..."

  nf_two.2.d:0 "Anarchy followed the flames that consumed the old world - whatever nuclear fire did not reach was soon fought over by the survivors. Few could describe the horrors that followed as the fabrics of society unravelled, men and women reduced to their most basic instincts. \nThe story of Two Sun could have ended before it even began, had it not been for the Cult of Nas. Employees of a pre-war auto racing company banded together to give hope to the helpless; racers would patrol the city, while mechanics and priests maintained their equipment and kept the generators running. They freely accepted the surrounding areas when they came seeking protection from the threats that now roamed the wastes, and the stories and knowledge they shared would become the basis of Nas. We still remember the very first story they told..."

  nf_two.3.d:0 "The demon was found abandoned on the steps to the great temple of Cannonball. No parents to his name, no resident women known to have given birth; in time, some would question if the demon even had any, or was a gift from Nas. At first the priests took him for a simple orphan, raising him amongst them so that he may one day join their ranks, but in time the true destiny of the child would reveal itself. For it is not red blood that runs through the Demon's veins, it is black oil; fitting for Wyatt, the man that might be the greatest racer that has ever roamed the wasteland. While his legend grows with every feat and victory, we should not forget about his humble beginnings. Before He took his true place among Nas' greatest, He was a..."

  nf_two.4.d:0 "Many Years have passed since Two Sun has sworn fealty to Caesar - while some of the older racers still lament the loss of autonomy, the relationship has always been mutually beneficial. The Legion controls large stretches of land, rich in resources Two Sun desperately needs to not only maintain but expand our growing arsenal of vehicles. Meanwhile, the Legion benefits greatly from our expertise; with our cars, we have enabled them to perform lightning-fast strikes at a moments notice, and shift troops and supply at speeds that could never be rivalled by foot. We have proven our loyalty numerous times, both on and outside of the battlefield and none can deny that the Legion has repaid our devotion by making us..."

  nf_two.7.d:0 "In the early morning hours, groups of armed young men broke the curfew and stormed official buildings and warehouses, with our troops barely able to hold them off from breaking into the newly built temple of Nas itself. The Insurgents are lead by former Arizona Rangers, determined not to let their new home fall under the Legion's banner without a fight. It will require special action to truly bring them to heel."

  nf_two.9.d:0 "This time, their tribute is accompanied by a concerning question about our southern neighbour. While we have made investigations into the Generalissimo and his men in the past, they have only confirmed what we already suspected; Vialla might be a profligate, but his fondness for Legion coin (as well as a basic sense of self preservation) have kept him loyal. Now however, our subjects have presented new evidence that might suggest that Gente is secretly intending to align itself with the Rio Pact; if this is true, we may need to re-evaluate our stance towards the Generalissimo.\n\nAfter some deliberation Caesar told the delegation:"

  nf_two.11.t:0 "One Last Hurrah"
  nf_two.11.d:0 "The forces of Two Sun have fought their way deep into the heartland of Gente Del Sol. The people found themselves quickly abandoned by their supposed leader Vialla, who decided it was time to go on a prolonged vacation on his yacht, with the state treasury and numerous mistresses in toe. However, one man remained behind, to protect the people of Gente against the victorious legion and its lap dogs; attacking supply lines and even launching raids across the former border itself, he has grown from a nuisance to a symbol of resistance for those that still rally against your rule.\nIn the end it was Wyatt who would bring down the self-proclaimed freedom fighter. Tracking him to one of Gente’s high mountain passes the two entered a chase worthy of admiration along the treacherous mountain road. Wyatt was victorious in the end and Sun Eater was forced to admit defeat - and to the surprise of anyone but Wyatt has agreed to enter Two Sun’s services."

It is only fitting that the one we intend to hold in the name of Mars and Caesar himself shall be the greatest competition the wasteland has ever seen. New tracks will be built, new cars constructed, new garages built and smaller races held, all in preparation for the main event, one that is sure to attract attention from all over. To ensure that the greatest racers the wastes have to offer all get the opportunity to take part, we shall send out invitations to those deemed skilful enough to participate."

The people of Two Sun and their honoured guests are now celebrating this momentous occasion, with promises to come together for an even greater competition should fortune allow it."

But the safety of the Legion must not be allowed to be put at risk by one man any longer. The Generalissimo shall be led to execution by command of Caesar.
