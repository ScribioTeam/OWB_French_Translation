  KHA_diane:0 "Diane"
  KHA_diane_desc:0 "Diane is a drug dealer and member of the Great Khans. You can often find her and Jack together, although it seems to be mostly Jack who follows her around rather than a mutual friendship."
  KHA_anders:0 "Anders"

  KHA_focus_great_hunts_desc:0 "In the past we’ve taken to hunting when times were quiet. The hides and meat of the Geckos and Bighorners can serve our people well—and the hunt itself is such a thrill!"

  KHA_focus_camp_armouries:0 "Camp Armouries"
  KHA_focus_camp_armouries_desc:0 "Our warriors should not be purely dependent on the labour of slaves to create and maintain their weapons, vehicles and armour. Each warrior should be capable of building and maintaining their own, and each camp should maintain the facilities to do so."

  KHA_focus_arms_workshops:0 "Arms Workshops"
  KHA_focus_arms_workshops_desc:0 "Camp armouries alone won't be able to cut it for the scale of weaponry production we need—instead, we should set up workshops solely devoted to the production of weapons."

  KHA_focus_slave_workshops:0 "Slave Workshops"
  KHA_focus_slave_workshops_desc:0 "Slaves in arms workshops has long been a part of the production line, but we should now ensure they are tightly woven into the production system. This will ensure only increasing productivity!"

  KHA_focus_warrior_scholars:0 "Warrior Scholars"
  KHA_focus_warrior_scholars_desc:0 "When we are not fighting, hunting, building or maintaining our gear, we should not sit back and rest our laurels. Instead we should study, ponder and learn. Anything we can learn from the wasteland is useful—it may just save lives one day."

  KHA_focus_overwhelming_firepower:0 "Overwhelming Firepower"
  KHA_focus_overwhelming_firepower_desc:0 "We don't have the men to match either the NCR or the Legion, but we can sure as hell match them in the size of our heavy guns."

  KHA_focus_warrior_training:0 "Warrior Training"
  KHA_focus_warrior_training_desc:0 "Our new guns are only as good as the soldiers that can fire them—we should therefore ensure every Khan is trained to be able to fire any weapon they find in their hands!"

  KHA_focus_reuse_old_factories:0 "Reuse Old Factories"
  KHA_focus_reuse_old_factories_desc:0 "The wasteland is filled with old, desolate factories—many still containing semi-useable equipment—that we can, and should, quickly make use."

  KHA_focus_lessons_of_history_desc:0 "Throughout our existence, we have won numerous victories—and recovered from many defeats. All of these battles should influence how we wage war—and manage ourselves in peace—going forwards."

  KHA_focus_on_the_move:0 "On The Move"
  KHA_focus_on_the_move_desc:0 "The Khans never stop moving. To do this effectively, we must be able to live off what the land provides and ensure our industry is always able to follow us."

  KHA_focus_synthesise_our_own_chems:0 "Synthesise Our Own Chems"
  KHA_focus_synthesise_our_own_chems_desc:0 "The Followers of the Apocalypse, when they came, gave us gifts of technology and taught us how to make many weapons. However, they also taught us to synthesise our own chemicals—and oh boy were they a step up from the natural opioids we have grown used to."

  KHA_focus_founders_of_the_chem_trade:0 "Founders of the Chem Trade"
  KHA_focus_founders_of_the_chem_trade_desc:0 "Few crops grow in Redrock Canyon—fortunately the foundation plants of many chemicals are amongst some of the few that do. As a result, many Mojave gangs rely on us for their supply of chems—earning us the title of the 'founders' of the chem trade."

  KHA_focus_old_friends:0 "Old Friends"
  KHA_focus_old_friends_desc:0 "Some of the old raider groups which we left the vault with depend on us for new and exciting drugs. We should take advantage of this for as long as we can—it will only see us prosper, and may even make them easy pickings in the future."

  KHA_focus_crimson_caravan_trade_deals:0 "Crimson Caravan Trade Deals"
  KHA_focus_crimson_caravan_trade_deals_desc:0 "The NCR officially has a ban on addictive drugs, but both the Crimson Caravan and many of the wealthy, independent merchants that make up the NCR frequently turn a blind eye in order to make a profit. This allows us to spread our influence throughout the corrupt elite of the NCR!"

  KHA_focus_the_logical_path:0 "The Logical Option"
  KHA_focus_the_logical_path_desc:0 "Few in the wasteland are worthy of even the consideration of an alliance with the Khans, but across the Colorado a very similar beast awaits. The Legion maintains many of the same views we do—including an undying hatred of the NCR—and so we should cozy up with them. Who knows? We may even crush the NCR together."

  KHA_focus_a_friend_of_the_legion:0 "A Friend of the Legion"
  KHA_focus_a_friend_of_the_legion_desc:0 "The Legion may be closely aligned with us on many issues of policy, but we do not currently have many diplomatic ties—indeed, some of the Legion's leadership sees us as little more than tribal savages! (Honestly! Us, savages! Our soldiers wash twice a fortnight—that's twice as much as they do!) We should seek to enlighten them about our heritage and culture, so that our two civilizations may intertwine."

  KHA_focus_caesars_advisor:0 "Caesar's Advisor"
  KHA_focus_caesars_advisor_desc:0 "As a symbol of our growing friendship, Caesar sent to us one of his most trusted advisors—a frumentarii who goes by the name of Karl.

  KHA_focus_join_the_legion:0 "Join the Legion"
  KHA_focus_join_the_legion_desc:0 "A grand military alliance between us and the Bull across the Colorado is the logical progression to our current relationship with the Legion. All we need to do is ask for it."

  KHA_focus_ideas_of_the_legion_desc:0 "More than one thing has spread when we began adopting some of the Legion's tactics and organisation—namely, their rejection of all things automated. It's a view we'll have to accept if we want further benefit from the alliance."

  KHA_focus_legion_slave_trade:0 "Legion Slave Trade"
  KHA_focus_legion_slave_trade_desc:0 "Both the economy of the Legion and our own economy rely heavily on the trading of slaves. We should, as a result, attempt to combine our slave pools—giving us more access to the kinds of slaves we need the most."

  KHA_focus_a_bastion_across_the_colorado:0 "A Bastion Across the Colorado"
  KHA_focus_a_bastion_across_the_colorado_desc:0 "Whilst we're technically in a military alliance with the Legion, it's more or less taken for granted they will be unable to assist us directly should the NCR invade. Consequentially, we must build up our own defences to fend off said threat."

  KHA_focus_war_with_ncr:0 "Prepare for War with the Bear"
  KHA_focus_war_with_ncr_desc:0 "It will not be long now before we have our pound of flesh, but we are in need of some more fighting men to fill our ranks! Let us call the warbands back home."

  KHA_focus_avenge_bittersprings:0 "Avenge Bitter Springs"
  KHA_focus_avenge_bittersprings_desc:0 "The drums of war have been sounded. We will not be pushed back. We will never relent. We must drive these dogs back to where they came from. Never again will they massacre our innocent women and children! To arms!"

  KHA_focus_legion_industry:0 "Legion Industrial Ideas"
  KHA_focus_legion_industry_desc:0 "Advisors from the Legion have explained to us several techniques to improve our industrial capacity through better use of slave labour and more efficient metal working. These shall undoubtedly help us increase our output to newfound heights!"

  KHA_focus_legion_weapons_desc:0 "Caesar himself has ordered that we be supplied with several tonnes of weapons, ammunition, explosives, and other equipment, so that we may be able to better hold our own against the NCR. We should graciously accept."

  KHA_focus_fake_neutrality:0 "A Facade of Neutrality"
  KHA_focus_fake_neutrality_desc:0 "Whilst the protection the Legion offers is appealing, they demand too much from us in return. Instead, we should do things our own way—though it is obvious which side we favour in the clash between the Bear and the Bull."

  KHA_focus_our_own_slave_trade:0 "Our Own Slave Trade"
  KHA_focus_our_own_slave_trade_desc:0 "Slaves run many economies in the wasteland—ours included. We should prioritise enslaving as many people as we can to increase our industrial capacity."

  KHA_focus_backhand_support:0 "Cloak and Dagger"
  KHA_focus_backhand_support_desc:0 "Directly engaging the NCR troops on our borders would only lead to waves of troopers sent against us. Instead, we should send some of our elite troops to the Legion to assist them in their fight—allowing us some oh so sweet revenge whilst not jeopardizing the lives of our women and children yet again."

  KHA_focus_khan_addicts:0 "Synthetic Opioids"
  KHA_focus_khan_addicts_desc:0 "With new technology our own people have shifted from use of the old natural opioids to much, much stronger synthetic opioids—jet and psycho. Only an idiot would step in the way of one of these drug addicted brutes."

  KHA_focus_khan_overdose:0 "Doped Up Khans"
  KHA_focus_khan_overdose_desc:0 "By giving out a larger amount of chems before battle, we will be able to \"dope up\" our men—putting them in a fit of rage and giving them a significant attack bonus at the cost of organisation."

  KHA_focus_upgrade_the_arsenal:0 "Upgrade the Arsenal"
  KHA_focus_upgrade_the_arsenal_desc:0 "No matter how courageous our forces are in battle, they can't defeat an NCR trooper with a laser musket when only equipped with a knife. We should upgrade our weaponry so that our prowess can shine."

  KHA_focus_a_khan_holds_their_own:0 "A Khan Can Hold His Own"
  KHA_focus_a_khan_holds_their_own_desc:0 "In order to even join the Khans, a warrior must prove he can hold his own in one-on-one battle. Many of our enemies don't receive the same training."

  KHA_focus_cheap_firearms:0 "Cheap Firearms"
  KHA_focus_cheap_firearms_desc:0 "The wasteland is a treasure trove of abandoned weapons and other equipment. We must exploit this!"

  KHA_focus_impale_the_enemy:0 "Impale Our Enemies"
  KHA_focus_impale_the_enemy_desc:0 "A true Khan warrior is one that does not cower when directly in the face of his enemy, event when outgunned and outnumbered. They instead pull together and destroy anyone who opposes them against all odds—well, and the thermic lance they wield sure helps."

  KHA_focus_deal_with_gun_runners:0 "A Deal with the Gun Runners"
  KHA_focus_deal_with_gun_runners_desc:0 "A loosely-knit band of Boneyard dwellers, the Gun Runners have had a long past in the business that bears its name. They take pride in constructing only the finest, and highest-quality weapons. Although located primarily in the Boneyard the Gun Runners operate several small factories on the outskirts of New Vegas, and like every other dirty merchant they would be willing to supply us with arms for caps."

  KHA_focus_the_khan_arena:0 "The Khan Arena"
  KHA_focus_the_khan_arena_desc:0 "A large arena resides in the canyon where multiple Khans hone their melee fighting abilities. Inside the arena, Khans fight in great competitions to determine the ultimate warriors—and the winners of these competitions are usually snapped up to become leaders of warbands."

  KHA_focus_weapon_manafacturing_quantity:0 "Mass Production"
  KHA_focus_weapon_manafacturing_quantity_desc:0 "Whilst every Khan can fight well unarmed, this is not always feasible—especially when facing down NCR troopers armed to the teeth with guns. We should focus on making weapons!"

  KHA_focus_new_tactics:0 "New Tactics"
  KHA_focus_new_tactics_desc:0 "Whilst our clashes with the NCR have meant we know a thing or two about how they fight, it also means they know a thing or two about how we fight. We need to stay unpredictable!"

  KHA_focus_iron_steeds:0 "Iron Steeds"
  KHA_focus_iron_steeds_desc:0 "Genghis Khan led his warriors across the vast steppes on the backs of grand warhorses. We will lead ours on the backs of something much faster, and much sexier—the motorbike."

  KHA_focus_build_a_weapons_stockpile:0 "Create a Stockpile"
  KHA_focus_build_a_weapons_stockpile_desc:0 "While the going is easy, we must always be preparing for time when the going gets tough. Stockpiling weapons will at least give us something to fall back on..."

  KHA_focus_old_world_civilization:0 "Old World Civilization"
  KHA_focus_old_world_civilization_desc:0 "Raiding is not the only way to make ends meet in the wasteland—indeed, farming, hunting and gathering can be just as lucrative."

  KHA_focus_one_community:0 "Tribal Spirit"
  KHA_focus_one_community_desc:0 "The Great Khans are one big family—everyone cares for each other, and someone is always there to catch you if you fall. We have our fights, but we always work out our differences. This is perhaps our greatest asset."

  KHA_focus_fire_support:0 "Fire Support"

  KHA_focus_military_planning:0 "Careful Planning"
  KHA_focus_military_planning_desc:0 "Total war was never a viable strategy for the Khans—we were too few and stretched too far. Instead, we should plan our assaults so that each attack deals maximum damage."

  KHA_focus_medical_advancements:0 "Medical Advancements"
  KHA_focus_medical_advancements_desc:0 "When the Followers first came to us they aided us in the form of technological advancements—one of the most important lessons they taught us was how to make our own medication, helping us tend to the battle-wounded."

  KHA_focus_electronic_technology:0 "Electronic Technology"
  KHA_focus_electronic_technology_desc:0 "While the knowledge the Followers of the Apocalypse granted to us is extensive, it lacks the knowledge on how to reproduce technology in significant quantities or how to introduce improvements. That's where we come in..."

  KHA_focus_industrial_aid:0 "Industrial Aid"

Oscar managed to survive due to his unique sniper abilities, allowing him to cut down the NCR troopers who attempted to follow him up the narrow mountain passes.

  KHA_focus_expand_northwards_desc:0 "The Sky Reavers to our north currently occupy Area 51, a highly prized pre-war military facility that seems to have so far remained immune to marauding raider bands.

He will guide us to our vengeance across the wastes."

  nf_tmb.1.t:0 "Wait! This isn't Mongolia!"
  nf_tmb.1.d:0 "While our saviour saved us from that deranged courier, some things he mentions do not make sense at all. He claims that there are animal steeds that can match the ferocity of our metal steeds, called horses. He also has no memories about the history of our people, outside of claiming we lived in the fabled lands of Mongolia. He did not took it well when we told him the man named 'Roman von Ungern Sternberg' died 354 years ago at the hands of the Soviet Union."

He calmly tried to explain the situation to the Mister House using his endless charisma. 'People of Vegas want, no, demand communism with Elvis characteristics.' Mr. House was shocked, but the King did not allow him to speak. 'You, me, we're all kings. Here king you dropped this, lemme open this chamber and give it to you.' As he struggled to open the antechamber, Mr. House went into a tangent about Ayn Rand and moochers and looters and other sort of capitalist propaganda. King successfully managed to disable his neural interface stating 'Comrade House, I'm disabling your access to the neural interface. Now it is OUR interface."

I saw movies and I was the revolutionary in the movie. So every dream I ever dreamed has come true a hundred times...I learned very early in life that: ‘Without communism, the workday would never end; without communism, a man ain’t got a comrade; without communism, the road would never bend - without communism.' So I keep crushing capitalism. Goodnight. Thank you.."
