  MOJ_the_wastelands_last_great_mind_desc:0 "Why am I even talking to you? I have more important things to be doing then explaining my plans to an imbecile."
  MOJ_journey_to_the_mojave:0 "Journey to the Mojave"
  MOJ_journey_to_the_mojave_desc:0 "The Elders at Lost Hills probably thought that this assignment was my banishment, a way to keep me from "corrupting" their ideals.\nLittle did they know that this is what, in the end, I have always wanted."
  MOJ_children_playing_with_bombs:0 "Like "Children Playing With Bombs""
  MOJ_children_playing_with_bombs_desc:0 "It would have been a perfect assignment, a playground of pre-war wonders for me to plunder and claim for my own ends.\nThere is only one thing keeping me from what I deserve, and its name is "NCR"."
  moj_power_armor_blueprints:0 "Power Armour Blueprints"
  moj_power_armor_blueprints_desc:0 "When I arrived here from Lost Hills my detachment was hardly equipped to deal with the threats we would face - I imagine not even Lost Hills would have predicted that the NCR would have arrived before us.\nI need to see if I can write up some improvements to the old power armor blueprints, find ways to make more use of the stock we brought over."
  moj_prep_optimising_helios_one:0 "Optimising HELIOS One"
  moj_prep_optimising_helios_one_desc:0 "I may have lost the Dam to the NCR, but at least I have HELIOS. Maybe I can spend some time with the systems of HELIOS to improve its output.."
  moj_prep_realign_the_panels:0 "Realign Solar Panels"
  moj_prep_realign_the_panels_desc:0 "While Poseidon engineers were able to account for much they didn't seem capable of accounting for the slight shifts to Earth's orbital axis that would occur after the Great War.\nIdiots.\nI can update the alignment program and shift it to match Earth's new orbit, should improve the output by at least two decimal points."

  moj_prep_improving_the_codebase_desc:0 "They forgot a bracket."
  moj_prep_raw_poseidon_energy:0 "Raw Poseidon Energy"
  moj_prep_raw_poseidon_energy_desc:0 "HELIOS One will be the heart of the Brotherhood, energy beating from its veins and giving me the strength to do what lesser minds may find impossible."
  moj_prep_overlock_hidden_valley_generators:0 "Overclock Hidden Valley Generators"
  moj_prep_overlock_hidden_valley_generators_desc:0 "I don't have time to be doing that renovation work, for the purposes of energy core recharging we can just use the energy stockpiles located at Hidden Valley."
  moj_prep_work_with_the_gun_runners:0 "Work With the Gun Runners"
  moj_prep_work_with_the_gun_runners_desc:0 "I respect the Gun Runners more than the rest of the children merrily dancing around post apocalyptia. Rather then just acting as scavengers shifting through the garbage they actually take the effort to make their own weapons.\nIt's something that Lost Hills would never do but I could cut a deal with them to allow them to act as our arms supplier."
  moj_prep_refurbish_our_stockpile:0 "Refurbish Derelict Stockpile"
  moj_prep_refurbish_our_stockpile_desc:0 "Only one in ten suits of power armor have working pilot lights.\nOnly one in twenty of our microfusion cells come in full charge.\nOnly one in fifty of our power armour servos are to code.\nObviously this is a problem!"
  moj_prep_microfusion_cell_replacement:0 "Microfusion Cell Refurbishing"
  moj_prep_microfusion_cell_replacement_desc:0 "Turns out that most of our MF-Cells aren't even real MF, just energy shells re-fitted to fit to Plasma Rifle chambers. This is ridiculous - was Lost Hills trying to get me killed?"
  moj_prep_heavy_duty_ballistic_barrels:0 "Heavy Duty Ballistic Barrels"
  moj_prep_heavy_duty_ballistic_barrels_desc:0 "A paladin approached me the other day, telling me that the barrel of their AVENGER Minigun literally melted off the weapons chassis after thirty seconds of sustained test fire.\nGuess that means I need to sign off on replacement work to have our entire weapon barrel stock replaced."
  moj_prep_walking_artillery:0 "Walking Artillery"
  moj_prep_walking_artillery_desc:0 "Paladins are essentially walking artillery, capable of both taking and dealing sustained damage in a way unalike a regular soldier. It is why the Brotherhood has been able to prosper where others have failed."
  moj_simulation_training:0 "Simulation Training"
  moj_simulation_training_desc:0 "I always hated VR Training, sitting in a chair while a computer gives you delusions is no way to learn how the world really works, how it ticks and bends to your actions at the slightest touch. Still, some of our expedition is so inexperienced that a few rounds in a simulation ring might get them better ready for war."
  MOJ_preparing_for_sunburst:0 "Testing the Bear"
  MOJ_preparing_for_sunburst_desc:0 "The NCR swarms like ants over Old World relics, its only a matter of time before they come after HELIOS to try to take what is mine.\nI need to break the NCR before they have that chance, and for that I need a plan."
  MOJ_mysteries_of_helios:0 "That Lucky Old Sun"
  MOJ_mysteries_of_helios_desc:0 "Hardin, McNamara and even Veronica find it foolish how much time I would invest into HELIOS One. Where they and I are different is that I can see what lies behind my sight. Out there, in orbit above the Earth is a weapon that can win the battle entirely if I was to bring it under my control.\nThat weapon is ARCHIMEDES, and I will prove that it really exists."
  moj_poseidon_relic_circuitry:0 "Poseidon Relic Circuitry"
  moj_poseidon_relic_circuitry_desc:0 "In order to get ARCHIMEDES operational I will need to find new circuit boards to replace those in the transmission equipment that have rotted away over the years. Wont be too hard to ask Brotherhood scouts to try to find this for me."
  moj_assigning_power:0 "Assigning Power"
  moj_assigning_power_desc:0 "ARCHIMEDES is an orbital weapon array that takes power from HELIOS, then uses it and sends it back to Earth in the form of a fiery, destructive beam. In order to do so I will need to ensure that power is properly being redirected to ARCHIMEDES."
  moj_petro_chico_military_encryption:0 "Petro Chico Military Encryption"
  moj_petro_chico_military_encryption_desc:0 "It seems that Poseidon brought on a few Petro Chico employees to work on ARCHIMEDES. It's strange, the encryption technology seeming to change and fight back against me as I try to break it - as if it had a personality of its own?\nNo matter, will be relatively simple to make it kneel with a few more tries..."
  MOJ_spears_from_the_sun:0 "Spears from the Sun"
  MOJ_spears_from_the_sun_desc:0 "A bit of bargaining has finally allowed one of my scouts to attain the last piece needed for activation of the ARCHIMEDES station, the "Euclid's C-Finder" as it is known is a trigger mechanism to allow ARCHIMEDES to attain a firing position.\nWould have been easier if they just let you code in the firing position manually - but I can't complain with these results."
  MOJ_open_hostility:0 "Tend to Your Business"
  MOJ_open_hostility_desc:0 "Hardin, my head Paladin is advising that I save the ARCHIMEDES project for later. Instead? He thinks that a surprise offensive will stall the NCR and give us the push we need to drive them out of the Mojave for good. Perhaps I should listen to him?"
  moj_caravan_raids:0 "Caravan Raids"
  moj_caravan_raids_desc:0 "The NCR relies on long caravans coming from the Long 15 to supply its forces. Hardin recommends to strike at the NCR early here so we might be able to gain an early advantage.\nIt will be a bloody fight - after all, the caravanners heading up through the Long 15 are often simple couriers and small Brahmin convoys."
  moj_searchlight_strike_force:0 "Searchlight Strike Force"
  moj_searchlight_strike_force_desc:0 "Camp Searchlight will be the main supply depot the NCR uses to push from the south. By striking at the NCR here we can ensure that they will be bleeding even before the battle starts."
  moj_van_graff_supply_runs:0 "Van Graff Supply Runs"
  moj_van_graff_supply_runs_desc:0 "The Van Graffs, if they were to side with the NCR put us at risk. Lets remove them from the picture and hurt their bottom line."
  moj_death_and_glory:0 "Death and Glory"
  moj_death_and_glory_desc:0 "Hardin and I have built a small "friendship" during the period of these raids. When he isn't here arguing with me and instead out there killing my enemies he can be a useful tool."
  moj_accept_veronicas_help:0 "I Could Make You Care"
  moj_accept_veronicas_help_desc:0 "Veronica was always the person I was closest to. Its why I had her come with me to the Mojave - I had to show her what could be accomplished if you know how to put the Old World to use in the right ways.\nNow though? She has a.. strange plan she has brought to my attention, she feels that if I was to get the denizens of the Mojave on my side, victory against the NCR would be assured."
  moj_ally_with_tabitha:0 "Using the Super Mutants"
  moj_ally_with_tabitha_desc:0 "Near Black Mountain lives a group of Super Mutants that are particularly.. strange. They are led by one calling themselves "Tabitha", a super mutant who uses radio broadcasts to tell other mutants of her nation of "Utobitha". According to Veronica could be easily swayed to our side if we were to simply jam their broadcasts, then tell them that its the NCR that is keeping their broadcasts from playing."
  moj_work_with_the_bright:0 "Work with the Bright"
  moj_work_with_the_bright_desc:0 "The "Brotherhood of the Bright" as it is known is a collection of ghouls that believe in space there is a home out there that would be the perfect home for them. By using a REPCONN rocket they hope to travel there - they just need assistance. Veronica says that if we were to promise to help them get their rocket operational they would be willing to help us fight the NCR."
  moj_sway_the_star_chasers:0 "Sway the Star Chasers"
  moj_sway_the_star_chasers_desc:0 "Out there in the wasteland are a group known as "Star Chasers". unorganized, but experienced wastelanders trying to find Sunset Sarsaparilla Star Bottlecaps and an Old World treasure connected to them.\nVeronica has a plan in mind. If we were to simply spread the rumour that the NCR is here to hunt the caps they would join our side!"
  moj_support_of_the_mojave:0 "Paladins of the Mojave"
  moj_support_of_the_mojave_desc:0 "Veronica has been taking my advice to heart, it seems - but in her own way. She understands that people can be pushed and used to accomplish your goals if you merely give them a little incentive, yet still wishes to try for results that lead to every ones betterment, rather then just herself.\nShe still has some ways to go, but I like her progress so far."
  moj_emergency_ammunition:0 "Emergency Ammunition"

  moj_helios_citadel:0 "Establish Helios Citadel"
  moj_helios_citadel_desc:0 "With our Chapter no longer having to hide at Helios its time I guide the Brotherhood and show them where to establish their new base of operations.\nHelios might not have been a defensible location before - but I will make it into the Citadel it was always meant to be and prove them wrong. The Brotherhood will base their operations here!"
  moj_neck_of_the_colorado:0 "Neck of the Colorado"
  moj_neck_of_the_colorado_desc:0 "With our Chapter no longer having to hide at Helios its time I guide the Brotherhood and show them where to establish their new base of operations.\nThe Hoover Dam was always what I wanted out of the Mojave and its what I will get. The Brotherhood will base their operations there!"
  moj_fortify_hidden_valley:0 "Fortify Hidden Valley"
  moj_fortify_hidden_valley_desc:0 "With our Chapter no longer having to hide at Helios its time I guide the Brotherhood and show them where to establish their new base of operations.\nI can't have the Brotherhood advertising its victory - we will move to Hidden Valley and rebuild, fortify and prepare to ensure our victory is a long one."
  moj_integrating_the_mojave:0 "Integrating the Mojave"
  moj_integrating_the_mojave_desc:0 "Now that we have conquered the Mojave I need to ensure that the NCR can't simply come back here. I need to make it "mine"."
  moj_expand_the_188:0 "Expand the '188"
  moj_expand_the_188_desc:0 "The '188 Trade Station has always been Veronica's little hotspot for gossip and trading with wastelanders before the victory at sunburst. It may prove useful to expand our presence there."
  moj_controlling_nipton_through_fear:0 "Controlling Nipton Through Fear"
  moj_controlling_nipton_through_fear_desc:0 "Joseph Steyn, the mayor of Nipton is a tool unalike any other. The moment we beat the NCR he submitted to us and acknowledged Brotherhood leadership over Nipton - likely as a means by which he could ensure his own life.\nSmart."
  moj_offer_power_for_compliance:0 "Offer Power for Compliance"
  moj_offer_power_for_compliance_desc:0 "The Brotherhood's rule over the Mojave will be a simple one - they will turn over scientific and notable material and offer food and labour services when asked. In return? We will direct power from HELIOS to the hardest working and most loyal of townships, granting them luxury in exchange for their obedience."
  moj_mandatory_service_for_all:0 "Mandatory Service for All"
  moj_mandatory_service_for_all_desc:0 "I am not a monster.\nWe will simply require that all denizens of the southern Mojave move from their homes, travel to [MOJ.Capital.GetName] and attempt to go through a rigorous test to join as a initiate. Finding as many suitable initiates as possible needs to be my priority in the Mojave."

  moj_rend_the_mojave_dry:0 "Rend the Mojave Dry"
  moj_rend_the_mojave_dry_desc:0 "Technology cannot remain in the hands of wastelanders any longer. Everything that could be a threat should be considered a threat. It's not enough to follow up sightings of technology in the wasteland, rather it's time to proactively search for it. Kick down every door, pull open every closet. We won't stop looking until the house is empty, or until the occupants are dead: or both."

  moj_post_sunburst_helios_research:0 "Post-Sunburst Helios Research"
  moj_post_sunburst_helios_research_desc:0 "Now that I don't have to worry about the bear breathing down my neck I can give HELIOS the time it needs."

  moj_to_the_great_beyond:0 "To the Great Beyond"
  moj_to_the_great_beyond_desc:0 "Veronica, for some reason is insisting that I actually go through and try to help these groups with the Brotherhood's resources. While a purely humanitarian effort would be a waste of my time no reason I can't find some useful information in the interim. The Ghouls travelling to the "Great Beyond" actually have a fair knowledge of REPCONN rocket systems. Perhaps they can share that information when we help them?"
  moj_hunt_the_stars_for_the_seekers:0 "Hunt the Stars for the Seekers"
  moj_hunt_the_stars_for_the_seekers_desc:0 "Admittedly, the devotion that these star seekers have to finding Festus's treasure is impressive. Lets send a few scouts out and follow them, see if any of them ever actually uncover something of importance for the Brotherhood."
  moj_black_mountain_radio_broadcasts:0 "The Black Mountain Trap"
  moj_black_mountain_radio_broadcasts_desc:0 "Surprisingly, keeping Utobitha around and allowing them to continue their broadcasts is very useful. It effectively acts as a "lure", bringing Super Mutants out of hiding and into our territory - from there allowing us to gun them down and keep their numbers low."
  moj_elijahs_ambitions:0 "Elijah's Ambition"
  moj_elijahs_ambitions_desc:0 "This is my moment! My chance to gain what I have always deserved."

  moj_houses_schematics_desc:0 "The Lucky 38 is a treasure trove. Now? It is "my" treasure trove.\nI'll send in a few paladins to rip apart the casino, find out what made House's industry tick. I would love to figure out what made his life sustaining technology work..."
  moj_jewel_of_the_mojave:0 "Jewel of the Mojave"
  moj_jewel_of_the_mojave_desc:0 "Its a wonder that House has lived as long as he did. I am not a superstitious man - but he got lucky.\nIts time my soldiers take a vacation to Vegas, enjoy the night life of the city of sin before they bring in a management shift.\nNo monopoly rules forever, after all."
  moj_work_with_benny:0 "Work With Benny"
  moj_work_with_benny_desc:0 "Benny, the leader of the Tops has made it a point to approach us and offer his aid. Its clear that Benny is the type of man to respect power, aligning himself with whoever he thinks is the best bet to win.\nHe has bet well this time, at least."
  moj_scavenge_vault_21:0 "Scavenge Vault 21"
  moj_scavenge_vault_21_desc:0 "Vault 21 has been - regretfully - mostly filled in by this point. A empty hole in the ground lined with Vault-Tec steel. After my scouts tear it down it will just be a hole in the ground, won't even recognise it as a vault anymore."
  moj_steward_of_vegas:0 "Steward of Vegas"
  moj_steward_of_vegas_desc:0 "In truth? I never wanted to deal with Vegas on my own. It was too much work - more interested in the technological relics there then the reformed tribals and hopeless gamblers. Benny has offered a solution! Before, he was plotting to take over Vegas with the aid of a specialized AI uploaded to the Lucky 38 to replace House.\nI like this "Yes Man" already.."
  moj_enlist_the_families:0 "Enlist the Families"
  moj_enlist_the_families_desc:0 "In truth? I never wanted to deal with Vegas on my own. It was too much work - more interested in the technological relics there then the reformed tribals and hopeless gamblers. No reason to break something that was working - we can simply have the reformed tribals that were there submit to us and grant us tribute in return for us mostly leaving them alone."
  moj_houses_ultimate_treasure:0 "Houses Ultimate Treasure"
  moj_houses_ultimate_treasure_desc:0 "My policy toward ruling Vegas - of benign dictatorship has really paid off. A member of the Tops has given us a rather.. particular little thing. They say its the "Platinum Chip", a little piece of technology that is the key to upgrading Securitron AI. While we don't use House's Securitrons outside of the Strip we can take advantage of the knowledge in this marvellous little chip."

  moj_preparing_against_the_legion:0 "Preparing Against the Legion"
  moj_preparing_against_the_legion_desc:0 "Idiots! Idiots all of them!\nThese paladins can't even fight faux classical age soldiers. They have a two thousand year technological and tactical advantage over them! This shouldn't be happening! Everyone needs to prepare for the Legion, we can't be made fools of again!"
  moj_reserve_power_in_archimedes:0 "Reserve Power in ARCHIMEDES"
  moj_reserve_power_in_archimedes_desc:0 "If I am going to defeat the Legion I need to ensure that the ARCHIMEDES satellite is fully operational. Should be trivial to store a small pocket of backup power in HELIOS for the day the Legion arrives."
  moj_rescue_legion_slaves:0 "Rescue Legion Slaves"
  moj_rescue_legion_slaves_desc:0 "Slavery is a efficient system if used right - yet often it is used by true idiots who can't do the work themselves.\nLets steal the Legion's slaves, bring them to the Mojave and deprive the Legion of the workers they rely so."
  moj_fortifying_the_dam:0 "Fortifying the Dam"
  moj_fortifying_the_dam_desc:0 "The Dam is a heavily defensible location. I'll have McNamara fortify it for me and manage the defences against the Legion proper."
  moj_smelt_down_legion_currency:0 "Smelt Down Legion Currency"
  moj_smelt_down_legion_currency_desc:0 "The Legion's currency is gold, a rare medal in the Old World. Lets smelt it down and use it as replacement circuitry wires."
  moj_reward_veterans_of_the_legion_campaign:0 "Rewarding Veterans of the Legion Campaign"
  moj_reward_veterans_of_the_legion_campaign_desc:0 "While I don't normally hand out baubles for a job well done this campaign was a difficult one. I will ensure - at least - that the hardest working of those soldiers who battled in this campaign are aware of their contribution."
  moj_soldiers_of_helios:0 "Soldiers of Helios"
  moj_soldiers_of_helios_desc:0 "The Soldiers of Helios is the name given to the battalions that fought and served in both Operation Sunburst and the First Battle of the Hoover Dam. A little propaganda never hurt to inspire the troops and weaken the enemy, even if I was never one for such things."

  moj_repconn_development:0 "REPCONN Development"
  moj_repconn_development_desc:0 "Rocketry technology is something that is so hard to test in practice - its reliance on the infrastructure of the United States bringing in fuel, metal and scientists something that is entirely not possible in the Wasteland. Still, I am lucky to have found this site. By studying the rockets in this place - and the mistakes they have made - I can build something even better then what was available back then."
  moj_study_primm_slimm:0 "Study Primm Slim"
  moj_study_primm_slimm_desc:0 "In the town of Primm there is a rather strange Old World robot by the name of "Primm Slim". Robots that have had personalities installed and been active this long always have useful little bits of knowledge. Lets have that robot go on a field trip across the Mojave - I might learn something from its old memory banks."
  moj_follow_the_navarro_survivors:0 "Chasing "Devil's Brigade""
  moj_follow_the_navarro_survivors_desc:0 "Hardin has heard rumours that a Navarro Remnants cell exists somewhere in the Mojave. Lets have them build a task force to try to locate and eliminate these enemies to the Brotherhood."
  moj_the_cipher_expedition:0 "The Cipher Expedition"
  moj_the_cipher_expedition_desc:0 "My top choice of expedition target was always to come here, to the Mojave.\nMy second choice? Definitely the Ciphers. The Ciphers of the West have been mythologised as great protectors of technology! I think sending a few scouts out east will serve well to learn more of this group."

  moj_design_cloud_walker_power_armor_desc:0 "It turns out that the filtration units on the suits of those beasts living near the Sierra Madre was never working correctly, working to seal the Cloud in their suits more then give them safety from it. In order for our paladins to strike into the Sierra Madre they will need new filtration suits on their Power Armour... At the same time I could also include a few upgrades here and there."
  moj_brotherhood_teams:0 "Brotherhood Scouting Teams"
  moj_brotherhood_teams_desc:0 "The Gala Event is the way in which we will open the Sierra Madre, and for it I need different people at different places acting in unison - like a machine\nA more central, focused Brotherhood offensive will be what we need to trigger the Gala event.

  moj_wastelander_teams:0 "Wastelander Scouting Teams"
  moj_wastelander_teams_desc:0 "The Gala Event is the way in which we will open the Sierra Madre, and for it I need different people at different places acting in unison - like a machine\nThe fact that this treasure is so tempting is exactly "why" I need to use outsiders of the Brotherhood.

  MOJ_port_expansion:0 "Port Expansion"
  MOJ_port_expansion_desc:0 "In order to host a fleet of operational size we require numerous facilities, such as dry docks, maintenance yards, piers, etc. In order to accomplish our goals we'll need to invest heavily in the expansion of our existing naval infrastructure."

  MOJ_supporting_vessels:0 "Sea Raiders"
  MOJ_supporting_vessels_desc:0 "Smaller and lighter craft make up the bulk of modern wasteland navies. To keep our edge in the seas we must invest in the production of simple, robust crafts, who can harass enemy vessels with ease."

  MOJ_larger_vessels:0 "Siege Ships"
  MOJ_larger_vessels_desc:0 "In order to make any kind of dent in an enemy navy, and to effectively support our troops on the shore, we need to be capable of building large ships capable of mounting large weaponry. Focusing on this will bring us closer to naval domination."

  MOJ_reclaim_a_flagship:0 "Reclaim a Flagship"
  MOJ_reclaim_a_flagship_desc:0 "Power projection is everything. In order to truly make our mark on the seas we cannot simply have an effective navy: we must also have an impressive one. A refitted flagship of the Old World would suit our needs nicely."

  MOJ_aerial_operations:0 "Aerial Operations"
  MOJ_aerial_operations_desc:0 "Flexibility is something our organisation often lacks. In order to account for our weaknesses we must turn them into strengths. In the past, vast expeditions have been undertaken with the aid of aerial equipment. We can learn from this."

  MOJ_from_the_skies:0 "From The Skies"
  MOJ_from_the_skies_desc:0 "Although we possess the knowledge to retrofit the most basic of aircraft, we have no knowledge on how to pilot them in combat, or how to utilise them tactically. We should turn to our databases and adapt as much information on pre-war air tactics as we can."

  MOJ_staging_bases:0 "Staging Bases"
  MOJ_staging_bases_desc:0 "Aircraft are oversized paperweights without the proper facilities to maintain and arm them, and enough open space to take off and land. If we want to develop an effective air force we need to scout for ideal locations to create airfields, and do just that."

  MOJ_aerial_supremacy:0 "Aerial Supremacy"
  MOJ_aerial_supremacy_desc:0 "With our newfound understanding of ariel combat, we can begin to redesign our planes with the wasteland in mind. Cutting corners where possible will save us a lot of production time and valuable resources, both of which are things in scarce supply currently."

  MOJ_flight_academy_desc:0 "Pilots are the lifeblood of an air force, and our pilots need to make effective use of our limited supply of planes, ammunition, and equipment.

  MOJ_our_right:0 "Our Right"
  MOJ_our_right_desc:0 "As a technocratic organisation, every piece of tech is rightfully ours. We do not steal technology out of malice or spite, we take it away to protect the innocents who will inevitably misuse it. Although people don't always understand, everything we do is ultimately to keep the wasteland safe. Our understanding of technology is second to none."

  MOJ_salvaged_metal:0 "Salvaged Metal"
  MOJ_salvaged_metal_desc:0 "Metal salvage is easy to come by. Twisted scraps of metal are as common as dirt in the wasteland, protruding from buildings, buried in the Earth like weeds, and strewn across streets like rubbish. Salvaging the metal in our immediate area will provide us with more resources for our equipment."

  MOJ_increase_power_production:0 "Increase Power Production"
  MOJ_increase_power_production_desc:0 "Generators are both a blessing and a curse. They create large amounts of power for relatively low maintenance cost, but they often require specific fuel cells and are difficult to redesign to run off of corn fuel. Investing in power generation will always benefit our equipment output."

  MOJ_salvaged_electronics:0 "Salvaged Electronics"
  MOJ_salvaged_electronics_desc:0 "Salvaging electronics is much more difficult than salvaging metal, in part due to the delicate nature of most electronics. At best, pulling the wiring and circuitry from radios, robots, and broken energy weapons will provide us with more scrap electronics for future projects."

  MOJ_advanced_tech:0 "Advanced Tech"
  MOJ_advanced_tech_desc:0 "Gathering rare technology is not only difficult, but dangerous. Often, the locations where rare pre-war technology can be found are also filled with killer robots, deadly radiation, or other hazards. Still, gathering advanced tech will allow us to create numerous high-end pieces of equipment, so it must be done."

  MOJ_fueling_our_rise:0 "Fuelling Our Rise"
  MOJ_fueling_our_rise_desc:0 "Fuel comes in all forms, but often our scavenging parties search for the nuclear variety. Unspent fuel cells are incredibly valuable to everyone in the wasteland, but especially to us. They power our power armour, our gatling lasers, and our generators. Securing them is a high priority for all scouts."

  MOJ_arm_foundries:0 "Arms Foundries"
  MOJ_arm_foundries_desc:0 "We cannot spread and uphold our doctrine without force, and we cannot apply force effectively if our men are undersupplied. If the Brotherhood is to continue its operations, we must not only take technology from the hands of settlers, but produce it ourselves."

  MOJ_civilian_workshops:0 "Civilian Workshops"
  MOJ_civilian_workshops_desc:0 "Many of the bunkers and bases we seek to occupy were not left untouched by the Great War, and they require extensive repairs and excavation efforts to become fully usable. To ensure that we're prepared for future construction efforts, we should begin to develop a small industrial base of our own."

  MOJ_heavy_production:0 "Heavy Production"
  MOJ_heavy_production_desc:0 "With our civilian and military industry projects finished we're seeing our efforts pay off hand over fist. In order to continue to foster success and fuel our growth, we should launch a second, smaller construction effort, focusing on a mixture of both branches. Alongside this, we can set up infrastructure for future efforts, also."

  MOJ_our_might:0 "Our Might"
  MOJ_our_might_desc:0 "The Brotherhood of Steel is feared and respected throughout the wasteland for our military might. In terms of combat effectiveness, we are high above the dregs the wasteland has to offer. One man in power armour is worth ten unarmoured soldiers, if not more. Studying previous engagements will help us improve our future combat doctrine."

  MOJ_steel_legions:0 "Steel Legions"
  MOJ_steel_legions_desc:0 "Standing side by side our men form a wall of unbreakable strength. The Brotherhood is like one long chain, spread out across the continent, with many, many links throughout its length. No part of the Brotherhood is weak, every man and woman is trained to a level of proficiency other groups can only dream of."

  MOJ_new_initiates:0 "New Initiates"
  MOJ_new_initiates_desc:0 "We're more than just a military organisation, the Brotherhood is one large family. Our knights, paladins, and scribes are all free to pursue relationships, marry, and have children. This is how the Brotherhood survives. When these children come of age, they become initiates, and start their training for their respective discipline."

  MOJ_t45d_production:0 "T-45d Production"
  MOJ_t45d_production_desc:0 "T-45d was the first model of power armour produced by America, and it shows. A simple frame, lacklustre servos, exposed weak points and a less than impressive helmet design. Still, any power armour is better than none, and its simplicity makes it faster to fix and produce."

  MOJ_t51b_production:0 "T-51b Production"
  MOJ_t51b_production_desc:0 "The pinnacle of pre-war power armour design, the T-51b model is a favourite among the Brotherhood of Steel for its robust design, shaped ceramic armour, lack of clear weak points, and expertly crafted helmet and filters. Although harder to maintain and produce, there's no doubt that T-51b is superior to T-45d in every way."

  MOJ_wastelander_conscripts:0 "Wastelander Conscripts"
  MOJ_wastelander_conscripts_desc:0 "Wastelanders are a dime a dozen, with little special or unique about them. Often short sighted, brutish, and too simple to understand the danger of technology: we often avoid them like the plague. Still, sometimes, new blood is required. At times like these, we hunt the population for worthy candidates, often accepting proven and friendly wastelanders into our ranks."

  MOJ_flesh_before_steel:0 "Flesh Before Steel"
  MOJ_flesh_before_steel_desc:0 "\"The flesh is weak,\" a common phrase with a vastly different meaning to others than to us. In the Brotherhood, this phrase is said to express and accept that the human body is frail. Even with our power armour we are still human, and unless the body inside the armour has been trained properly, it will die off long before the armour breaks. All initiates are trained to understand this: weakness is human."

  MOJ_basic_arms_for_basic_people:0 "Basic Arms for Basic People"
  MOJ_basic_arms_for_basic_people_desc:0 "Even wastelanders recruited into our ranks cannot be expected to understand technology as well as we do. In order to prevent any unfortunate accidents, we provide wasteland recruits with simpler energy weapons until they've proven themselves capable. Naturally, this means we produce and salvage many weapons ahead of time for new recruits."

  MOJ_doctrinal_thought:0 "Doctrinal Thought"
  MOJ_doctrinal_thought_desc:0 "With new blood comes new ideas. Wastelanders think and fight a different way to the Brotherhood, and this experience often proves valuable for the Brotherhood as a whole. By making our wasteland initiates compose reports of their previous battles, we can examine them to gauge the state of the wasteland, and prepare accordingly."

  MOJ_combined_operations:0 "Combined Operations"
  MOJ_combined_operations_desc:0 "Learning to fight alongside former wastelanders can be difficult. Their wild, survivalist minded style of combat can often be hectic and unpredictable. This is precisely why recruiting them can be so valuable, and why fitting them into our command structure is so beneficial. That wild, unpredictable nature only makes our squads more effective than before."

  MOJ_our_goal:0 "Our Goal"
  MOJ_our_goal_desc:0 "The Brotherhood's ideology is straight forward. We desire a world in which the recklessness of man cannot be enabled by the tools he wields, a world in which atrocities aren't committed for the sake of \"scientific progress.\" This is why we confiscate technology, and destroy that which we cannot confiscate. All of our duties are for the good of mankind as a whole."

  MOJ_seek_technology:0 "Technological Study"
  MOJ_seek_technology_desc:0 "Replicating the electronics of the pre-war is a difficult task, even for the simplest of designs. If we want to have any hope of reliably recreating somewhat advanced designs, we need to dissect our precious few working pre-war models and examine their inner workings. It's painful, but unless we can figure out the secret behind these things, we'll forever be in the dark."

  MOJ_scribe_research:0 "Scribe Research"
  MOJ_scribe_research_desc:0 "Pushing our scribes towards longer research projects will inevitably reward us. Prioritising long term study and self reflection should make our results more accurate, and having scribes accompany scouting squads should make them much more capable of investigating pre-war sites. Scribes are the backbone of the Brotherhood, we must continue to hone their skills."

  MOJ_old_developments:0 "Old Developments"
  MOJ_old_developments_desc:0 "Pre-war technology is inherently valuable, even if it's broken and only pure scrap. Scouring pre-war ruins for undiscovered rare technology, whether broken or somewhat working, is an important part of the Brotherhood's operations in the wasteland."

  MOJ_robotic_advancements:0 "Robotic Advancements"
  MOJ_robotic_advancements_desc:0 "Robotics was one of America's largest industries before the Great War, and it was considered a world leader in the field of robotics. As a result of this the wasteland is scattered with the shells of broken robots, as well as the roaming figures of those still following outdated programming. Taking both apart will aid us in building robots for our own ends."

  MOJ_vertibird_schematics:0 "Vertibird Schematics"
  MOJ_vertibird_schematics_desc:0 "The most prized of all pre-war schematics, the schematics for Vertibirds are rare and difficult to come across. All known copies have only ever come from the Enclave, and with their demise this precious supply has dried up. Still, former Enclave technicians who escaped their demise often take many tools with them... and sometimes, a schematic or two."

  MOJ_bunker_thought:0 "Bunker Mindset"
  MOJ_bunker_thought_desc:0 "Almost all members of the Brotherhood were born in a bunker, and most of us spent our lives growing up in and around them. For us, the safety of a bunker is reassuring and comforting. As a result, Brotherhood fortifications are built to a higher standard than most others, due to our familiarity with reinforced structures."

  MOJ_surface_outposts:0 "Surface Outposts"
  MOJ_surface_outposts_desc:0 "In order to expand our operations farther and farther, we require secure facilities to store supplies and rest between expeditions. Establishing a construction corps specifically for the purpose of building surface fortifications would benefit us greatly."

  MOJ_underground_workshops:0 "Underground Workshops"
  MOJ_underground_workshops_desc:0 "Expanding our industrial base inside of our bunker network is our next priority. Setting up industry within fortified positions will allow us to continue to create a respectable output even while on the back foot, effectively creating a layer of industry that our enemy cannot take until the very end."

  MOJ_new_technology:0 "Technological Breakthrough"
  MOJ_new_technology_desc:0 "Our scribes have made a series of significant scientific discoveries in rapid succession, broadening our horizons and impacting all of our current research projects from the ground up. This is truly incredible, as these teachings will allow us to pursue our research and restoration projects faster than ever before."

  MOJ_tesla_theory:0 "Tesla Theory"
  MOJ_tesla_theory_desc:0 "With our new breakthroughs in the field of science, our scribes have been able to recreate a pre-war schematic we found long ago. Formerly, we were incapable of reproducing its effects without disastrous results. Now, however, we've finally managed to stabilise the design enough for combat use. Tesla weaponry has been added to our armouries!"

  MOJ_chapter_leadership:0 "Chapter Leadership"
  MOJ_chapter_leadership_desc:0 "Within the innermost part of Hidden Valley, a great debate is taking place between Elijah and McNamara over the future of the Mojave Chapter itself. The core of the debate is centred around Elijah's obsession with the Old World, and how it negatively impacts the chapter. The outcome of the debate remains uncertain."

  MOJ_elijah:0 "Elijah"
  MOJ_elijah_desc:0 "After the debate, Elijah managed to retain control of his chapter, even with tensions still high. However, seeing his determination to follow his ambitions has created as much awe as ire, and his position remains absolute. Elijah is the undisputed leader of the Mojave Chapter."

  MOJ_scribal_thought:0 "Scribal Thought"
  MOJ_scribal_thought_desc:0 "Elijah, unlike all other elders, is a scribe: not a paladin. His background has had an effect on his style of leadership, which puts greater emphasis on research and the study of pre-war technology. Although many in the Brotherhood have doubted his approach, none can deny that he obtains results other Elders simply cannot."

  MOJ_old_world_rumours:0 "Rumours of the Old World"
  MOJ_old_world_rumours_desc:0 "Elijah has heard many stories about the mysterious Sierra Madre, and he spends the beginning of every expedition staring at the ominous figure of Helios One in the distance. Both of these places have dark secrets waiting to be uncovered, their roots dig deep into Old World conspiracy. Elijah believes he has the key to unlocking those secrets."

  MOJ_helios_one:0 "Retaking Helios One"
  MOJ_helios_one_desc:0 "The NCR has robbed us of Helios One, a key part of Elijah's greater ambitions. Its energy output is essential to the future of the chapter itself, and Elijah insists that there's more to the facility than meets the eye. Whether or not his delusions will prove true, the fact remains that we cannot allow the NCR to control such advanced and dangerous technology."

  MOJ_energy_boom:0 "Energy Boom"
  MOJ_energy_boom_desc:0 "Helios One is a miracle of pre-war science, highly advanced even for its day, and completely irreplaceable in the modern wasteland. Elijah, however, is undaunted by these issues facing him. His mind works in mysterious ways, and he's assured us that he will be able to repair the facility, given time. Considering the output has recently increased, he might just be worth believing."

  MOJ_sierra_madre:0 "Sierra Madre"
  MOJ_sierra_madre_desc:0 "An invitation left unanswered for 200 years calls the wasteland to a grand opening unlike any other, where friends and freedom await. You can begin again, the sultry voice promises, and who doesn't want that? Many a desperate fool has followed that forgotten voice, and now, the Brotherhood is going to do the same."

  MOJ_a_forgotten_hellscape:0 "A Forgotten Hellscape"
  MOJ_a_forgotten_hellscape_desc:0 "The air smells like Old World gold, rust, and blood. The Sierra Madre has all of these in spades, indeed, its streets are lined with gold, choked by rust, and slick with blood. The rumours were all true, this is paradise on Earth: but a nuclear holocaust, 200 years of neglect, a parasitic cloud that devours men in their armour, and mysterious ghost people have turned it into a forgotten Hellscape."

  MOJ_what_remains:0 "What Remains"
  MOJ_what_remains_desc:0 "Death incarnate: that is the Sierra Madre's true form. In a place filled with nothing but death and despair, little remains, but those few dregs are like liquid starlight. Unkillable men who stalk the heart of the casino and vending machines capable of making something from almost nothing: these are the gifts left to us by the ghosts of the Sierra Madre."

  MOJ_a_forgotten_weapon:0 "A Forgotten Weapon"
  MOJ_a_forgotten_weapon_desc:0 "Elijah's promises have come true. Even after his genius brought Helios One back to a quarter of its total output, we were sceptical of his claims. Today, however, we were proven deeply wrong in our estimation of his promise. White light that splits the sky with a scream, leaving nothing but charred remains in its wake: this is the weapon Elijah has delivered to us."

  MOJ_hardin:0 "Hardin"
  MOJ_hardin_desc:0 "Hardin has emerged the victor of the debate, although he wielded a weapon instead of words. Standing tall over Elijah's still warm ashes in the gloom of that bunker, McNamara simply stood aside and let Hardin have his way. For better or worse, this West Coast loyalist now leads the Mojave Chapter."

  MOJ_paladin_thought:0 "Paladin Thought"
  MOJ_paladin_thought_desc:0 "Hardin is a true believer in the doctrine put forward by the Western Brotherhood, having been somewhat loathe to leave the heart of the Brotherhood behind. With his newfound power as the Elder of the Mojave Chapter, Hardin will focus on what he knows best: combat."

  MOJ_know_our_name:0 "Know Our Name"
  MOJ_know_our_name_desc:0 "For too long the Brotherhood has been considered weak by the population of the Mojave. They do not talk of us in hushed tones anymore, rather, they speak openly about how free of our influence they are. They call us \"tin cans\" and joke about our doctrine of tech reclamation. No longer! Soon, the day of reckoning will come for the Mojave, and they will know our name."

  MOJ_closedown_van_graffs_desc:0 "The Van Graff family is well known throughout California, their name is often whispered in seedy bars and back alleys. Their influence throughout Redding and North California is immense, but it wanes the farther away you go. It's time to teach the Van Graffs a stern lesson: selling pre-war tech in Brotherhood territory drastically shortens your lifespan."

  MOJ_gun_runner_caravan_raids:0 "Gun Runners Caravan Raids"
  MOJ_gun_runner_caravan_raids_desc:0 "The Gun Runners are one of the only organisations in the post-war that can be considered master craftsmen. Working off of tightly guarded pre-war gun schematics, the Gun Runners produce and sell top of the line weapons for a high price. Their operations in the Mojave aren't nearly as well guarded as they should be, and killing is easier than scavenging..."

  MOJ_ncr_raids:0 "NCR Raids"
  MOJ_ncr_raids_desc:0 "The NCR disgraced the Brotherhood decades ago. They've never been friendly towards the Mojave Chapter, often firing upon our patrols, and now the time has come to repay them for their lack of hospitality. Mojave Outpost will be left in ruins, Camp Golf will burn. This is what happens when you fuck with the Brotherhood."

  MOJ_contact_the_west:0 "Contact The West"
  MOJ_contact_the_west_desc:0 "Finally the day has come for the Mojave Chapter to reunite with the Western Brotherhood. Hardin's campaign of death and destruction has seen many spoils transferred to Hidden Valley's armoury, and his results are sure to please the West. Now all we can do is wait to hear back from him."

  MOJ_aggressive_policy:0 "Aggressive Policy"
  MOJ_aggressive_policy_desc:0 "Shoot first and ask questions later: that's what Hardin has drilled into the minds of his soldiers. The Mojave Chapter is hanging on by a thread, surrounded by enemies, it simply cannot afford mercy any longer. In Hardin's quest to scorch the Mojave with laser burns, kindness and mercy are relics of the past. All that matters is whether you can shoot straight, and how high your daily kill-count is."

  MOJ_mcnamara:0 "McNamara"
  MOJ_mcnamara_desc:0 "With control wrested from Elijah, McNamara had a hard road ahead of him. Lacking the support of the West, and with the NCR and Legion both heading on an impact course centred on the Mojave, The Mojave Brotherhood needed to open up to the world at large."

  MOJ_progressive_thought:0 "Progressive Thought"
  MOJ_progressive_thought_desc:0 "Opening our doors to the Mojave also means opening our doors to the troubles of the wastes. Not only that, but the emergence of a highly militarized, power armour wearing warriors makes the locals nervous and distrustful of us. A possible solution would be to arm and train local peacekeeping and militia forces in the lands under our protection, bringing them into the fold."
