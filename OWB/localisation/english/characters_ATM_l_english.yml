  ATM_SISTER_ROSE_DESC:0 "Sister Rose is an intense woman, with little tolerance for doubt or failure, but that fervor has become a source of strength for those around her. While many of her brothers and sisters under Atom still hold the trials and exhaustion of the journey west forefront in their hearts, Rose’s gaze is firmly fixed upon the future.There are many sacred silos dotted around the Dakotas and out into further lands, and it is her sincere wish to dedicate each and every one as a new temple to Glorious Atom. Then may he come and bring the Day of Division!"
