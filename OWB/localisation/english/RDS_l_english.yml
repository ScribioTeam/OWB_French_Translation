  ncr_red_begin_the_talks_desc:0 "Tandi-era regulations have kept the best of Redding's industry buried in red tape. Coming up with a new deal between us and the barons will uncap our potential."
  ncr_red_trade_situation:0 "Restore the Trade"
  ncr_red_trade_situation_desc:0 "The constant talk of war and bloodbaths in California has dried up our caravan routes and now the constant stream of pack brahmin are a distant memory. \n\nLet's reassure the merchant companies that Redding is a safe haven from the war so the waters of trade can flow once more."

  ncr_red_shake_dragon_hand_desc:0 "Everyone in the wasteland knows the Shi are not to be crossed, hell, even the NCR couldn't pacify them! \n\nWe should carefully approach San Francisco and see if we can't strike a deal regarding our docking rights and future trade."

  ncr_red_redding_calling_desc:0 "§4Redding Calling!§! \n\nVault City has long stood as a beacon of the technological future. We should send a smooth talking messenger and see if we can't strike a trade deal in return for some of their computing power."

  ncr_red_mercs_desc:0 "Due to our newfound immense wealth we can be a bit more liberal when it comes to spending our vast pile of cash. \n\nIf Redding were to ever have a conflict it is actively participating in then it would be wise to approach the Eurekan mercenaries to see if they'll serve us for a great sum of cash."
  ncr_red_yakuza:0 "§tRed Dragons§!"
  ncr_red_yakuza_desc:0 "The primitive raider folk in the Yakuza Territories may not have enough brain cells to rub together to screw in a lightbulb but they are still good fighters. Setting aside some funds to hire Naga and his Red Dragons would make brute force possible."

  ncr_red_vlt_protectrons_desc:0 "The big brains at Vault City can't provide their own men and weapons in our purchase but they can provide a heap of decommissioned protectrons. Having our machines in our back lines would destroy any sabotage the enemy attempts."

  #Political
  ncr_red_support_calhoun:0 "A Good Man Needs Guns"
  ncr_red_support_calhoun_desc:0 "Calhoun holds on to morality and justice as the pillars of his movement but desperate times call for desperate measures. \n\nA good man's speech can't stop the dead from dying and the soldiers from marching, he must now take action against his rivals.

  ncr_red_support_moore_desc:0 "§gClever tyrants are never punished.§! \n\nThe highly decorated Colonel Moore has cut out her own place in the power struggles that are ruining California.

  ncr_red_congress_in_exile_desc:0 "While the former New Californian Congress was plagued with corruption and deceit there are still a few good Senators that seek exile from their tyrannical hunters. With enough of these politicians in exile we could form our own congress from the ground up."
  ncr_red_welcome_refuges:0 "Northern Oasis"
  ncr_red_welcome_refuges_desc:0 "As it turns out playing both sides of the war means you'll have double the amount of people seeking refuge... \n\nRedding's place as an oasis amongst the flames makes it ideal for all those refugees trying to escape the conflict that bring wads of cash that could quickly be ours."
  ncr_red_direct_aid:0 "Sending the Sheriffs?"
  ncr_red_direct_aid_desc:0 "Moore is asking that we send our Sheriffs to fight side by side with their raging infantry battalions... \n\nThe burning question at the Baron roundtables is whether we should show our direct support or stay in the shadows until the conflict's fate is decided."
  ncr_red_maxwell_initiative:0 "Maxwell Initiative"
  ncr_red_maxwell_initiative_desc:0 "Maxwell, the Redding union boss, has proposed that we spend our time and funds on revitalizing the abandoned workshops that once produced jackhammers and dynamite to produce weapons. The Unions give us an endless headache so maybe a little bit of investment in this initiative will appease their thirst for what they call "basic human rights"."
  ncr_red_flynn_economic_plan:0 "Flynn Economic Plan"
  ncr_red_flynn_economic_plan_desc:0 "The brain that Anton Flynn hides under his massive hat has come up with an economic plan that will satisfy the poor and jobless by giving them the opportunity to work. \n\nWe could send out some of these newly hired underlings to bonify the desert surroundings for a future industrial zone."
  ncr_red_lawrence_sheriffs:0 "Lawrence Sheriffs"
  ncr_red_lawrence_sheriffs_desc:0 "While we aren't necessarily in need of more law enforcement the Sheriffs seem to be unappeased with their current number of patrolmen. Lawrence has come forward with a list of 500 citizens willing to sign their lives off to the Sheriffs for a minimum wage, do we take his deal or reap the consequences of messing with the Sheriffs?"
  ncr_red_pacify_sheriffs:0 "Big Jim Goes to the Sheriffs"
  ncr_red_pacify_sheriffs_desc:0 "Big Jim is a respected figure in Redding, both by its people and by the organizations that run it. The Sheriffs have recently been growing rather tired with Baron rule as they run into more and more trouble with them. Who better to solve this than Big Jim himself? He'll go on behalf of Flynn and give a patriotic speech about Redding's roots and potential future with the Barons. Surely that'll keep them calm?"
  ncr_red_pacify_people:0 "Flynn And R.W.C."
  ncr_red_pacify_people_desc:0 "Flynn has decided to pull a stunt to appease the poor and hungry that crowd the areas where the Sheriffs don't patrol. He's now directly cooperating with the Unions in an attempt to gather support from the voting lower class. Whether this will cut all his ties with the Barons or simply disappoint them remains to be seen."
  ncr_red_flynn_address:0 "Anton Flynn's Address"
  ncr_red_flynn_address_desc:0 "§Y"We all make choices, but in the end our choices make us".§! \n\nAnton Flynn somehow managed to gather a crowd of street goers that numbered in the thousands, whether it was out of curiosity or support was unknown to him. All walks of life were attracted to the commotion that Flynn's popularity had created."

  ncr_rpr_only_people:0 "...Only People"
  ncr_rpr_only_people_desc:0 "The Barons were a group of thinly veiled modern day noblemen that controlled the city streets of Redding as if they were puppet masters. \n\nWe cut the head of the capitalist beast but in return lost hundreds of our brave revolutionaries in the process that shall forever be remembered and mourned as martyrs..."
  ncr_rpr_sheriff_support:0 "Servants of the People"
  ncr_rpr_sheriff_support_desc:0 "The old tyrants held their Sheriffs and Lawmen as agents of their societal destruction. Our initial march on Redding's streets was halted by their lead projectiles flying overhead, now they must face trial. \n\nIf we are to ever reform the public image of the law into something benevolent it should serve the people, not their masters."
  ncr_rpr_took_baron_stuff:0 "People's Ranches"
  ncr_rpr_took_baron_stuff_desc:0 "The Brahmin Barons held on to their property as if it were their own flesh and blood and were physically repulsed at the idea of giving a single cent of their profits to taxes. Their greed never paid off. \n\nThose selfish bastards will have all their land stripped and handed out equally between any farmers that wish to own part of it."
  ncr_rpr_support_calhoun:0 "The Good Fight"
  ncr_rpr_support_calhoun_desc:0 "The Californian Way is similar in vein to our revolution but they do not wish to take drastic measures to ensure their victory. \n\nHowever Calhoun has seen our struggle, he rallies support for our cause and wishes to send hundreds of volunteers to our doorstep. \nShall we fight the good fight together?"
  ncr_rpr_future_of_redding:0 "Roundtable Debate"
  ncr_rpr_future_of_redding_desc:0 "The time has come to decide how the revolution will guide itself into the future. Despite us being brothers in arms schisms have already started forming... \n\nThe Farmers are great supporters of Calhoun's dogma and believe in a decentralized government. The opposing Miners are headed by Daniel Maxwell and wish to establish an independent Redding."
  ncr_rpr_support_farmers:0 "§GFarmer Majority§!"
  ncr_rpr_support_farmers_desc:0 "The Farmers have won the debate about the future of the nation, thousands poured out into the streets to support the main tenets of the movement. \n\nGoing on Redding will not be seen as a place to exploit workers and acquire cheap metals, it shall instead be known for its freedom from tyranny and moral justice."
  ncr_rpr_peoples_militia:0 "§GPeople's Militia§!"
  ncr_rpr_peoples_militia_desc:0 "The final decision on the fate of the Sheriffs has been made.

  ncr_rpr_people_of_california:0 "§GArise, Workers of California§!"
  ncr_rpr_people_of_california_desc:0 "§GArise, Workers of California!§! The downtrodden and betrayed of California deserve better than some fascist demagogue! March away from the tyrannical oppressors to the safety of Redding! We'll show Moore what it's like to be at the end of a rifle instead of sitting all day in a government building ruining the lives of men and women alike!"
  ncr_rpr_redding_tunnels_hide:0 "§GTunnel Warfare§!"
  ncr_rpr_redding_tunnels_hide_desc:0 "The tyrants in California may be infringing on our land and salting the earth behind them but there is one thing they won't expect! The subterranean freedom fighters we'll employ to dig their way across the wasteland to subvert enemy operations!"
  ncr_rpr_invite_followers:0 "Bearers of the Dharma Ideals"
  ncr_rpr_invite_followers_desc:0 "The Followers are a benevolent force that have aided the wasteland, subsisting on nothing but donations; they are truly some of the only good souls on this scorched earth. They come to Redding to aid us and spread the teachings of Dharma that Aradesh once spread."
  ncr_rpr_ranch_2_hospital:0 "The First Dharma Hospital"
  ncr_rpr_ranch_2_hospital_desc:0 "The Followers have decided they wish to set up a hospital in the outskirts of Redding where Anton Flynn's old ranch once resided. Let's tear apart the Baron's estate and rebuild it into something that saves lives and doesn't profit off them."
  ncr_rpr_support_miners:0 "§gPresident Maxwell§!"
  ncr_rpr_support_miners_desc:0 "President Maxwell arose amongst the chaos of the riots as a mediator. Being the leader of the Redding Mines Labour Union rendered him protected from the criticisms of the radicals as he had fought for their cause for years. The Miners looked to him for guidance and he bestowed upon them a bulletproof plan to take over the Presidential position without bloodshed."
  ncr_rpr_wanamingo_mine:0 "§gThe Legacy of Wanamingo Mines§!"
  ncr_rpr_wanamingo_mine_desc:0 "The Mines of Redding have always been inhabited by a slew of problems. One of the most memorable was the invasion of the Great Wanamingo Mine from foreign creatures. It was then that Mayor Ascorti decided it was wiser to sell off the mine and forget about the workers that had died there than deal with the problem and get it operational again. Let's remember the fallen miners by carrying rifles against our enemies."
  ncr_rpr_our_protectors:0 "§gProtectors of the Common Folk§!"
  ncr_rpr_our_protectors_desc:0 "The Sheriffs may have sparked the conflict leading to the deaths in the Redding Riots, however they were simply following orders.

  ncr_rpr_redding_tunnels_build_desc:0 "A pile of outdated and unuseable mining equipment was found in one of the old abandoned mines. How about instead of throwing away degraded  nitro and metal machinery we just repurpose them for makeshift explosives? \n\n§7These tools were made for boomin' and that's just what they'll do.§!"
  ncr_rpr_good_man:0 "A Good Man..."
  ncr_rpr_good_man_desc:0 "Calhoun has continued his fight against those in California that wish to see California in chains. Some believe that we should drop our differences and join them in a united struggle. \nOthers believe we should simply aid them however we can and decide their fate after the civil war is over. The final decision is up to the council."
  ncr_rpr_good_man_needs_us:0 "...Needs Us"
  ncr_rpr_good_man_needs_us_desc:0 "Calhoun can not fight his moral war alone! We must send our men and women to fight side by side with his saintly revolutionaries! Starting today we will no longer be separate entities, we will be one with each other!"
  ncr_rpr_good_man_needs_help:0 "...Needs Our Help"
  ncr_rpr_good_man_needs_help_desc:0 "Calhoun was a good soul and leader but sadly lost to the fascist demagogues that proclaim they want peace. We'll fight for our own peace by ending the existence of Moore's thinly veiled dictatorship! Long live Calhoun! Long live the Californian Way!"

  ncr_srf_baron_trials:0 "Baron Trials"
  ncr_srf_baron_trials_desc:0 "The Barons were the sole cause of Redding's deeply seeded corruption. \nTradition dictates we serve them without question, but a long run of enforcing tyranny under their rule has left many of us jaded regarding their claimed innocence. We'll simply do away with the Barons and hunker down for the oncoming factions that wish to end Redding in the civil war."
  ncr_srf_people_for_sheriffs:0 "The Sheriffs and The People"
  ncr_srf_people_for_sheriffs_desc:0 "The needs of the Sheriffs and their cooperators are more vital to the success of Redding than the needs of the people. Without proper munitions we could be attacked and find it impossible to retaliate with our current equipment."
  ncr_srf_the_old_guard:0 "Old But Gold"
  ncr_srf_the_old_guard_desc:0 "The new blood amongst the Sheriffs may disagree but the old ways are best. To hell with throwing away our traditions and being more lenient, this is how it's always been done. Our veterans will show the recruits what it truly means to be a Sheriff."
  ncr_srf_strong_redding:0 "The Path to Strong Redding"
  ncr_srf_strong_redding_desc:0 "Redding will never be a technological marvel in the wastes, we may as well live in reality. We need more guns and tools, not fancy new radios that cost a fortune. What matters in a war isn't how advanced your rifles are, but how many of them you carry."
  ncr_srf_old_dog:0 "Old Dog..."
  ncr_srf_old_dog_desc:0 "An old dog isn't exactly going to be the one developing the cutting tactics of the wasteland, but sometimes reliability is more important than innovation. Our veterans are going to drill our recruits with everything their instructors taught them decades ago and carry on our tried and true traditions."
  ncr_srf_and_new_tricks:0 "...And New Tricks"
  ncr_srf_and_new_tricks_desc:0 "They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks... But you can give him a shiny new laser rifle that'll do just as good as any new trick. The Van Graffs have maintained their hostility with us but none the less they still like the monthly caps we deliver to their doorstep for their cutting edge weaponry."
  ncr_srf_welcome_weaponsmiths:0 "Welcome Gunrunners"
  ncr_srf_welcome_weaponsmiths_desc:0 "The Gunrunners are lovely to do business with, they always carry the spectacular weapons they manufacture from their blueprints. Why don't we try and entice them to come do business in Redding by giving them a free plot of land and reduced tariffs?"
  ncr_srf_protected_not_isolated:0 "Protected, Not Isolated"
  ncr_srf_protected_not_isolated_desc:0 "The factionalism that rages in California has reached Redding's doorstep, instead of simply bowing to some other leader why don't we form our own pact? After all, who wouldn't want to fight side by side with the men who delivered the demise of the Barons?"
  ncr_srf_baron_stashes:0 "Blessed Are The Peacemakers"
  ncr_srf_baron_stashes_desc:0 "Six Shooters, Cowboy Repeaters and Single Shotguns. They've long been a staple of the Redding way of life, every citizen has a family firearm heirloom or two resting in their gun cabinet. However with threats looming on the horizon we can't afford to enter battles without the proper equipment. The Barons hid thousands of guns in secret stashes all along their ranches, why don't we find them and dig them up?"
  ncr_srf_ranches_2_workshops:0 "A Better Use"
  ncr_srf_ranches_2_workshops_desc:0 "After the Barons were arrested their property was left vacant and collected dust while we dealt with them. Why don't we reclaim this land to help the future of Redding with a task of utmost importance: gunsmithing."
  ncr_srf_redding_stronghold:0 "Stand Unshaken"
  ncr_srf_redding_stronghold_desc:0 "Redding may be a fledgling state but we've always known how to hold a border. Ever since the days where Ascorti ran the town every red blooded Redding citizen has known how to hold a rifle against tyrants. Why don't we show our enemies what we're made of by holding our lines harder than they could ever imagine."
  #New Outlook
  ncr_srf_pardon_some_barons:0 "We Need Them"
  ncr_srf_pardon_some_barons_desc:0 "A majority of the Barons are cold hearted criminals, however there are a few good hearted ones that Redding could use to strengthen its independence. The old blood in the Sheriffs wants to hunker down and prepare for the oncoming wars but surely we can't survive without funds from the Barons willing to cooperate."
  ncr_srf_sheriffs_for_people:0 "The People and The Sheriffs"
  ncr_srf_sheriffs_for_people_desc:0 "The folks of Redding have been filled with unrest in these troubling times. We need to instill some form of confidence in our government if we want the factory floors and mines operational once more. If the unrest isn't dealt with we'll lose the opportunity to use our factories so we can prepare for oncoming troubles."
  ncr_srf_new_outlook:0 "Redding Must Change"
  ncr_srf_new_outlook_desc:0 "For too long have the Sheriffs been governed by old and wretched souls. The fate of Redding will go down the same decadent destiny if we don't change the deck of cards we play with. Our future will not be as independent crooks but as cooperating authorities."
  ncr_srf_cooperative_redding:0 "The Path to New Redding"
  ncr_srf_cooperative_redding_desc:0 "A majority of the Barons were wasteland aristocrats and vane idiots. However some of them were true bona fide businessmen. A few of them have made propositions involving a land contract surrounding the former Kokoweef mines"
  ncr_srf_use_baron_connection:0 "Baron Connections"

  ncr_srf_thinking_big:0 "Thinking Big"
  ncr_srf_thinking_big_desc:0 "We can no longer uphold our former flawed alliances out of principle. These new age Barons have proved to us that we can rely on the good hearts of Redding and its independent neighbours."

  ncr_srf_coop_economy_desc:0 "The Big Circle Economic Deal will go down in the annals of history as the greatest and widespread contract to ever reach the eyes of the wasteland. All our neighbours will benefit from this and there aren't even any downsides!"
  ncr_srf_calm_old_guard:0 "Deal With the Old Guard"
  ncr_srf_calm_old_guard_desc:0 "While the old guard were once our brothers we must deal with them before this gets out of hand. A simple retirement notice should do for most of them hopefully. Let's hope old habits die young."

Today we finally achieved a triumph that shall be written down in the ages to come."
  ncr_srf_redding_calhoun:0 "Good Man Needs a Big Iron"
  ncr_srf_redding_calhoun_desc:0 "Calhoun holds on to fair justice very dearly but these desperate times call for us to come packin' with our big irons. \n\nA good man's speech can't incarcerate war criminals or ensure the law is fairly executed in this Californian bloodbath. He may be a hippie but he's our best shot for a future where Redding is free."
  ncr_srf_redding_moore:0 "Soldiers Like Us"
  ncr_srf_redding_moore_desc:0 "§gIt is better to be feared than loved.§! \n\nColonel Moore has carved her way through the civil war without batting an eye, she leads true soldiers with true ideals.

  # Redding Events
  ncr_red.1.t:0 "Join or Die!"
  ncr_red.1.d:0 "Anton Flynn silently remarked on the absurdity of what he was about to do. On an average day, the Malamute Saloon saw little more than drunken fighting and a thriving prostitution industry. Today, perhaps, it may see a place in the history books. Taking a small sip of whiskey, the Governor would begin.\n\n“The Republic was at one time, a beautiful dream of men and women working together, building a better future. Redding was a proud member of that union, despite the sacrifices we had to make to get there.”\n\nA few nods from the crowd and murmurs of agreement pushed Flynn to continue.\n\n“Nowadays though, I wouldn’t blame some folks for believing Redding would’ve been better off on it’s own. Sometimes I wonder about such things myself. Yet watching the Republic bleed brings me no joy. Perhaps that dream long gone still lives inside of me.”\n\nThe Lawmen in the crowd nodded along.\n\n“It’s clear to me though, Moore and her ilk never shared our dream. Burning congress, this permanent state of emergency, I think we all know the road to which this leads. We are not slaves to the flag of the Republic, but a servant of her principles.”\n\nA few miners in the crowd let out a cheer.\n\n“And Calhoun is little better. His Republic would steal from those who toil the land to feed those who have never toiled over anything in their lives. He would tax the men and women who feed the Republic into starvation themselves.”\n\nThe farmers piped up in agreement.\n\n“But I see a different path for Redding, and the Republic. The true patriots of this country have not forgotten the dreams of yesteryear and long to hear it’s song sung again. Not just in the north, but from Dayglow to the Boneyard, to Shady Sands the simple man truly hates those who seek to steer the Republic from her destiny.”\n\nHoots and hollering came from all sides of the room now. Anton even let a small smile come across his face before continuing.\n\n“Redding will not sit idly by. I call upon you, men and women of the whole north, rise. Sing of our dream and sing it so loud that even Moore can hear you, so that Calhoun can’t possibly ignore you, so that the whole of California may join us in seeking a rebirth of the true republic!”\n\nFlynn raised his glass above his head and knocked back all of the whiskey inside."

  ncr_red.5.d:0 "Anton Flynn read with visible irritation the piece of paper on which the Barons had written a speech intended for tonight's meeting. "What a bore," thought Flynn, "Tonight we gather here- blah blah get -overcame this tough situation- blah blah -look to the future. And I'm supposed to say this nonsense in front of a crowd?" Anton sighed heavily. Many considered Anton a puppet of the barons, a "talking head," and Anton didn't mind being in that position as long as it benefited him.\nOne thought, however, slipped through Flynn's mind more and more often. "They didn't do anything. It was my planning and work that helped raise Redding after the crisis, don't I deserve what I and so many others worked in sweat for?" Flynn used to chase that thought away, but in the hours before the meeting, he latched onto it. "I have an opportunity," Flynn thought, "Big Jim and O'Connell have already indicated to me that they will support me. Should I take my chances, or should the status quo be maintained?""

  ncr_red.7.d:0 "We've welcomed all walks of life, we were eventually going to wind up with some important political refugees. Mossman arrived with a band of hardcore loyalists seeking exile from his enemies. He has a storied past with all of California, the former poster child turned into an unaware terrorist as he performed acts that could hardly be considered sane. \n\nThe question lingering on everyone's minds is whether to risk the wrath of Moore or to hand him in. Can he reform into a better man and come join us in battle? Or will he fade away into obscurity like so many before him?"
  ncr_red.7.a:0 "Welcome, Mossman..."

One will cost us lives while the other will make the pockets of our citizens significantly shallower. Both arguments have foundation but are we truly ready to pledge ourselves to Moore? What of the mothers and fathers of the Sheriffs who will inevitably die, do they deserve peace knowing that their sons and daughters won't die in this senseless war?"

  ncr_red.9.t:0 "Roundtable Debate"
  ncr_red.9.d:0 "The question about the future of Redding was lingering on every patriot's mind. A great war had been fought against the tyrant Barons and it had ended in a victory for the people. But no one was prepared to fully replace them, they had truly been ingrained into every aspect of Redding! \n\nIn this divide two parties formed: the Miners and the Farmers. The former was a coalition of union members that had fought for the rights of the Redding miners for years, lead by a charismatic figure called Maxwell. The latter was a loose but large group of disgruntled farm hands and unemployed citizens. Maxwell debated with dozens of members of the Farmers for hours as he tried to convince them of the advantages of a less radical government. The debates raged on for days and were constantly filibustered but alas it was up to the people to decide. Who would they vote?"

  ncr_red.10.d:0 "The political party known as the Farmers has taken over in Redding, so far they have done nothing to indicate they aren't kind souls. They sent an emissary to the Boneyard to try and convince us to assimilate them into our cause. \n\nSurely more fighters on the frontlines against Moore's tyranny wouldn't be bad?"

  ncr_red.12.d:0 "A group of lawmen with fancily decorated Stetsons have come to our doorstep beckoning our attention for a simple question: will Redding be recognized as an independent state or simply as a territory we will eventually fight for? Who knows what actually recognizing Redding will lead to... But at the moment the decision is fairly important to our future. Do we want another future enemy or a possible friend?"
  ncr_red.12.a:0 "I like the sounds of their spurs."

  ncr_red.13.t:0 "Calhoun Agrees"
  ncr_red.13.d:0 "Calhoun has reached us with an answer about the proposition! He has agreed to sign a declaration that indicates Redding is a free territory unbound from its former relation to the New California Republic. He may not completely align with our ideals but he can surely see some sense in diplomacy, good enough for now."
  ncr_red.13.a:0 "Finally!"
  ncr_red.14.t:0 "Moore Agrees"
  ncr_red.14.d:0 "It seems our proposal has fallen upon deaf ears after being sent to Calhoun, is he plotting against us?! Thankfully the ever reliable Moore has answered our call for independence and has given us a firm agreement over the status of Redding's independence. While her terms were more strict than originally proposed I think we can all agree this is for the best. Tomorrow the sun will shine on a free and independent Redding!"

We knew the road to independence would be tough but we never thought we'd have to walk it alone! In fact, who needs a wise guy or a despotic woman to approve of our independence?

The people were fed up with all the tax cuts and deals that solely favoured the elite of Redding and pretended that it would all trickle down to the poor and beaten down. \n\nIt all started with a single brick thrown from a barbershop window, striking a Sheriff on the shoulder and startling the whole neighbourhood. As the lawmen went to investigate a barely audible noise was approaching, as they turned their heads to the horizon they saw a mighty herd of red eyed rioters. \n\nArmed with pitchforks, nailguns, baseball bats and streetsigns they quickly began rushing the officers with all the force they could muster. The sound of glass shattering and indistinguishable screams quickly became the temporary norm for the quiet street."

Card carrying members of the R.W.C. made up a majority of the crowd that now carried torches and gasoline to the mansions where their oppressors rested softly under their silk and satin covers. \n\nThe Union leader Maxwell wished it wouldn't have to come to this, but alas he had tried to deal with it peacefully in the past and that landed nowhere. But alas the Baron's aversion to negotiations was what led the workers of Redding to see them as the same type of thugs that suppressed Harlan county centuries ago."

Lawrence had tried the reasonable and diplomatic approach but a final solution to their problems was proposed in a roundtable meeting by an anonymous voice: "Arrest them all, what are they gonna do? Call the Sheriffs? Hahahaha!". \n\nWhile it may have seemed like a laughable proposition to most, the hard-headed Sheriffs had enough of the Baron's problems. They could collect their salary from the pockets of the Barons once they were in jail cells. \n\nIt was a strangely quick affair, a handful of enforcers sent to every mansion to collect their local Baron only to reveal they were being arrested once they had a pair of guns pointed at their cranium."
