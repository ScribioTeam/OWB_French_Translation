  PIPBOY_PLUS_REGION_TITLE_CASCADIA: "Cascadia"
  PIPBOY_PLUS_REGION_TEXT_CASCADIA: "Named for a failed independence movement and dead bioregion, the mountainous wilderness of §YCascadia§! is teeming with cannibals, raiders, and honest folk trying to eke out a living. To the south, savage tribals roam freely, playing games of war with each-other and devouring their human spoils. In the far north, the chilling grasp of §YAlaska§! begins to creep south, and the freezing waters are filled with vicious sea raiders. Caught between these two hells, the snow coated streets of §YSeattle§! teem with something distinctly unsettling. Post-war, §YCascadia§! is defined by brutality, not unity."
  PIPBOY_PLUS_REGION_TITLE_WEST_COAST: "The West Coast"
  PIPBOY_PLUS_REGION_TEXT_WEST_COAST: "§YThe West Coast§!, dubbed the §YCore Region§! by its denizens, commonly refers to a vast strip of land extending from §YBaja§! to §YArroyo§!. It encompasses the western coastline of the defunct §YUnited States of America§!, and is largely inhospitable. §YThe West§! has been witness to numerous important events throughout history, such as: the rise and fall of §YUnity§!, the arrival of the §YEnclave§!, the birth of the §YN.C.R.§!, and the emergence of the §YVault Dweller§!—and their descendant—the §YChosen One§!. With its glory days long passed, §YThe West Coast§! now faces an uncertain future fraught with insurrection and bloodshed."
  PIPBOY_PLUS_REGION_TITLE_THE_BIG_CIRCLE: "The Big Circle"
  PIPBOY_PLUS_REGION_TEXT_THE_BIG_CIRCLE: "Occupying the western portion of what was once §YNevada§!, §YThe Big Circle§! is the beating economic heart of §YThe West Coast§!, drawing in trade goods, raw resources, and capital from across the §YWasteland§!. Filled to bursting with crime lords, authoritarian intellects, despots, and a few rare heroic fools—it is a crucible for conflicts driven by blood, money, and revenge. Although previously dominated economically by §YNew Reno§!, and technologically by §YVault City§!, the recent emergence of §YNew Vegas§! has greatly disturbed the balance of power. Once more, the old guard must prove their worth through blood."
  PIPBOY_PLUS_REGION_TITLE_FAITHS_HEART: "Faith's Heart"
  PIPBOY_PLUS_REGION_TEXT_FAITHS_HEART: "Stretching from the very north of what was once §YArizona§!, to the vast mountainous territory of former §YIdaho§!, §YFaith's Heart§! is a slice of the §YWasteland§! filled with the faithful, their flocks, and savages who care little for questions of divinity. The vast southern expanse of the region is home to tribal communities who hunt endlessly, spilling blood and carving their own paths in this new, dead world. Overlooking these lost sheep, the shepherds arm themselves, guns aimed at each-other as they fight over who will save the souls of the §YWasteland§!—all the while damning themselves to §YHell§!."
  PIPBOY_PLUS_REGION_TITLE_THE_BULLS_DEMESNE: "The Bull's Demesne"
  PIPBOY_PLUS_REGION_TEXT_THE_BULLS_DEMESNE: "Formerly a rich tapestry of diverse tribal cultures and settler frontier towns, §YThe Bull's Demesne§! is now the stomping grounds of the most fearsome empire the §YWasteland§! has ever witnessed. In its southern domain, the population of §YNorth Mexico§! watches §YThe Bull's§! every move with caution. To the north-east, a vast frontier carves up the landscape, hosting a veritable buffet of expansion routes for a hungry conqueror. Beyond the §YArkansas River§!, the free men of §YColorado§! wait with bated breath, clutching their weapons tightly, as they prepare for the inevitable."
  PIPBOY_PLUS_REGION_TITLE_THE_MUTSLA_GULF: "The Mutant Gulf"
  PIPBOY_PLUS_REGION_TEXT_THE_MUTSLA_GULF: "The Mutant Gulf Description."
  PIPBOY_PLUS_REGION_TITLE_THE_LAND_OF_TITANS: "The Land of Titans"
  PIPBOY_PLUS_REGION_TEXT_THE_LAND_OF_TITANS: "§YMexico§! is colloquially known as §YThe Land of Titans§! due to its seeming proclivity for fostering large, ambitious nations in a crucible of unrest and mutant fauna. Its heartland is filled with the harrowing cries of dying warriors, whilst its north paradoxically fosters a beacon of democracy alongside a rich variety of criminal organisations, and all manner of hardened settler communities. With its lasting legacy of §YU.S.§! occupation omnipresent in the form of the region's dying lord and master, §YTlaloc§!, the shadow of the §YOld World§! chokes all who live beyond the §YRio Grande§!."
