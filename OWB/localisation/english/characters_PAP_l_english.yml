  PAP_FARDEEN_GUERRERO_NAME:0 "Prince Albert"
  PAP_FARDEEN_GUERRERO_DESC:0 "The Prince is never happier than when they’re sailing down the open river, but opportunities for such joy have been few and far between in recent days. Instead of searching for plunder on the water he must turn his eyes towards the mutinous dogs of the Brigade. Batford’s betrayal has soured the Prince’s normally good humor and he struggles to trust even his most loyal lieutenants now. Perhaps once Batford is dead Albert’s mood will brighten once more."
