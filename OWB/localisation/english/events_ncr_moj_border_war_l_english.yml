  NCR_MOJ_border_war.1.t:0 "Campaign Against the Brotherhood in the Mojave"
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.1.d:0 "After having cleared out the raiders the Mojave seemed to be in the republic's hands. The Brotherhood however will likely resist the republic's attempts to seize further control of the Mojave."
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.1.a:0 "Hire local Caravans for the offensive."
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.1.b:0 "Recruit local militias to fight for us."
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.1.c:0 "Rely solely on our Troops."
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.1_tt:0 "§YIf the Mojave Brotherhood chooses to confront the attack:§!\n"
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.1_tt_2:0 "§YIf the Mojave Brotherhood chooses to retreat:§!\n"

  NCR_MOJ_border_war.2.t:0 "NCR Launch Offensive"
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.2.d:0 "The NCR are not planning to let us grow stronger without more confrontations. Our Scouts have spotted large concentrations of NCR troops inside the Mojave and they seem posed to commit a campaign against us imminently."
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.2.a:0 "Confront the attack with whatever means we can afford!"
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.2.b:0 "Retreat into isolation."

  NCR_MOJ_border_war.3.t:0 "Brotherhood Retreat"
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.3.d:0 "Discovering our planned offensive through reports from their scouts, the Mojave Brotherhood have withdrawn their Troops further into Hidden Valley. Although they have avoided facing battle with us their cowardly withdrawal shows the Mojave that the republic is now the real force in charge of the area."
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.3.a:0 "Cowards!"

  NCR_MOJ_border_war.4.t:0 "Victory Against Brotherhood"
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.4.d:0 "Our commitment to routing the Brotherhood Troops has been successful, at least for now. Despite gaining information about the attack, the Brotherhood decided to confront our forces and were destroyed in our crossfire. This will likely lower their morale to fight in the future."
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.4.a:0 "And rightly so!"

  NCR_MOJ_border_war.5.t:0 "Brotherhood Repel Attack"
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.5.d:0 "Having gained information about our plans to launch an offensive beforehand, the Brotherhood Troops were prepared and confronted our attack. The troops we had managed to assemble in this area, where our power base is weak, were insufficient to defeat the Brotherhood forces. \nSadly, the attack has been turned against us and seen as a sign of the Brotherhood Troops recovery after their long retreat."
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.5.a:0 "It won't help them in the long run."

  NCR_MOJ_border_war.6.t:0 "Defeat Against the NCR"
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.6.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to repel the attack of locally assembled troops supporting the NCR government, our preparations were insufficient to stop it. With significant losses, we have been forced into a new retreat, albeit shorter.\n\nConfronting the outsiders before we had fully recovered may have been a mistake. Our magnificent recovery in the Long March instilled hope in our supporters, but now, seeds of doubt have been sown."
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.6.a:0 "We will recover and win the faith of the people again."

  NCR_MOJ_border_war.7.t:0 "Victory Against the NCR"
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.7.d:0 "Challenging the NCR offensive has worked in our favour. The locally assembled troops sent to confront the Brotherhood Troops were not prepared for our knowledge of the impending attack and were defeated, all serving as a warning to nearby warlords that attacking us can be costly.\n\nThe outsiders have only proved that they underestimate us as a foe, and that the People's Republic is once again on the rise."
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.7.a:0 "Political Power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

  NCR_MOJ_border_war.8.t:0 "Clash with Brotherhood Guerrillas"
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.8.d:0 "With both us and the Brotherhood Troops barely having recovered from our previous offensive, our mutual troop presence close to the border has reignited the conflict. In addition to the local warlords and militias, we have considered moving in more troops from elsewhere.\n\nAlthough this may not give us opportunity to crush the Brotherhood menace once and for all, it would be an important ideological victory to show that they will not be allowed to expand further."
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.8.a:0 "We must draw the line now!"
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.8.b:0 "We can't afford another confrontation."

  NCR_MOJ_border_war.9.t:0 "Defeat in [From.GetName]"
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.9.d:0 "Despite our efforts to push show that the Brotherhood will not be allowed to expand their influence outside of where they have currently taken refuge, we could not afford to commit enough resources to win the conflict along the [From.GetName] border.\n\nThe sporadic conflicts with Brotherhood militias slowly turned out more and more in their favour, which in the end made the campaign a failure in demonstrating that we have the situation under control. If their strength keeps increasing, the Brotherhood could turn out to be a genuine threat."
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.9.a:0 "Troubling."

  NCR_MOJ_border_war.10.t:0 "Victory in [From.From.GetName]"
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.10.d:0 "After a number of smaller encounters in the outskirts of our controlled territory, the conflict with the NCR appears to have turned to our advantage. Although maintaining constant pressure has been taxing on our troops and supplies, the effort has been worthwhile.\n\nNo decisive battles have been fought, we have won a slow victory this time, which has strengthened the faith in our cause and fanned the flames of the revolution once again."
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.10.a:0 "This will not be soon forgotten!"

  NCR_MOJ_border_war.11.t:0 "Defeat in [From.GetName]"
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.11.d:0 "Our efforts to wage an indirect war against the increased NCR presence has proven disastrous. The outsiders were simply more dedicated to pushing us back than we thought, perhaps expecting the impact this failure would have on our reputation. Although our army is once again safe to recover, for now, the losses have not gone unnoticed by other chapters and tales of our failure have been widely spread."
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.11.a:0 "The revolution is far from dead!"

  NCR_MOJ_border_war.12.t:0 "Victory in [From.From.GetName]"
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.12.d:0 "Our efforts to draw the line against the threat of the Brotherhood have been successful. The Mojave Brotherhoods guerrilla campaigns in response to our increased troop presence in regions surrounding their power base failed to anticipate our dedication to stopping them. This show of strength has ruined the reputation of the Brotherhood in the Mojave and improved ours."
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.12.a:0 "Let us hope they remember."

  NCR_MOJ_border_war.13.t:0 "Clash with NCR Army"
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.13.d:0 "While we have still barely recovered from their previous offensive, the outsiders appear to be increasing their troop presence in the areas close to our border. Clearly, they are trying to show that they once again have us contained and that our attempts to fight the NCR have only delayed their final strike against the Mojave Brotherhood. We cannot let the people think this is true."
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.13.a:0 "We cannot afford to spend our time recovering."

  NCR_MOJ_border_war.14.t:0 "Victory in the Mojave"
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.14.d:0 "Although it was a hard fought campaign, we have finally driven the Mojave Brotherhood back into Hidden Valley and firmly control a substantial portion of the Mojave. This is a great victory for the republic."
  NCR_MOJ_border_war.14.a:0 "Victory is ours!"

  NCR_MOJ_border_conflict_initiate_incident:0 "Stage Incident at [From.From.GetName] Border"
  NCR_mojave_campaign:0 "The Mojave Campaign"
  NCR_mojave_campaign_desc:0 "After the massacre of 38 NCR citizens at the hands of Mojave raiders in the same year, we must move to protect our people in the dangerous wasteland that is the Mojave. From intel gathered by our scout parties, not only raiders occupy this land. It appears the great war city of Vegas is remarkably intact, being relatively untouched by the great war. A chapter of the Brotherhood also appears to control a pre-war power plant called \"Helios One\". To say the least, they do not appear eager to share it with us. Defeating them will not be easy, we've been unable to discover their home bases, forcing us to push them back one battle at a time."
