  shi_origin:0 "The Journey to the East"
  shi_origin_desc:0 "Shih-Huang-Ti was the first Emperor of China, and the sacred vessel that carried us through the East.  But the Great War was not kind—the winds and waves relentless in the air that brewed nothing but chaos—and then when we hit shore all was quiet.  The Emperor would rise from the wreckage."
  shi_chosen_one:0 "Outlaws of the Desert Margin"
  shi_chosen_one_desc:0 "In the wake of unruly bandits from the sea, of enemies and strife, a tribal from Arroyo once graced our lands.  His legacy is sustained by inspiring stories, limericks and songs.  Would you care to listen?"
  shi_dream_of_the_bear_chamber:0 "Dream of the Bear's Chamber"
  shi_dream_of_the_bear_chamber_desc:0 "Since the Chosen One's departure, one of our greatest challenges is what to do with the NCR. The Bear is on our doorstep, a mighty trading partner and friend. But their expansion into Navarro and Redding means we are an island in the sea. If we are to survive, what shall we do?"
  shi_fuel_seaweed:0 "The Sea's Bounty"
  shi_fuel_seaweed_desc:0 "Decades ago our ancestors gandered at the shores of San Francisco and wondered: “How do we move forward from here?”  The answer was simple.  Nature is here to give, and for years we’ve cultivated the technique of turning seaweed and fruits into fuel.  Let us continue to hone this technique!"
  SHI_ncr_banking:0 "Loans to the NCR"
  SHI_ncr_banking_desc:0 "Our accrued political and financial stability has been noticed by the citizens of the NCR.  Some gaze at us with surprise, others with envy.  Tradition is sacred, but it has been shackling to keep to ourselves.  Should the Bear reach out to us, it would be in our benefit to accept any extended hands."
  shi_schools_debate:0 "The War's Unrest"
  shi_schools_debate_desc:0 "Tensions have begun to boil in the streets of San Francisco between the supporters of the Dragon and those of Lo Pan.  Debates about the direction of our future vary in opinion, and when words fail to strike, many turn to their fists.  In their palms their counterarguments, in their knuckles their thesis.  Who will triumph?"
  SHI_brotherhood_bunker:0 "Expand the Brotherhod Delegation"
  SHI_brotherhood_bunker_desc:0 "Despite the Brotherhood’s hostility to the NCR, we’ve tolerated them and their outposts around San Francisco.  Balance moves us forward, and we can do much more than act as the back channel for talks between these two factions. Shall we weave our fates closer?"
  shi_lessons_war:0 "Home From the War"
  shi_lessons_war_desc:0 "The Navarro Conflict has left our bones weary.  Seeds of doubt have been planted, and slowly some have begun to bloom.  Who was in the right?  Who should we follow now?  Outsiders?  Honour?  Emperor?  We must evaluate what lies ahead!"
  shi_thinking_of_future:0 "Thinking of the Future"
  shi_thinking_of_future_desc:0 "While we’ve honed our strength, our research plans have been left neglected for too long; we’ve forgotten about the future.  Much debate surrounds how we move forward.  Let us gather all these voices into consideration."
  shi_navarro_farms:0 "Navarro's Farms"
  shi_navarro_farms_desc:0 "While the new direction of the Shi has been inclined to break tradition, old cultivation techniques have remained.  Many have experimented with these ancient techniques and new ones, advocating for a hybrid technique—a unification of different cultures from observing our neighbours."
  shi_legalist_debate:0 "Legalist Debate"
  shi_legalist_debate_desc:0 "Legalism, legalism... ah, yes, legalism.  May morals bind us and guide us to the path of all things good.  Or is that a problem?  Does the new world render these values obsolete?  Though many would prefer to sow justice with their fists, words could hold merit beyond strikes and fires."
  shi_resolve_power_struggle:0 "Big Trouble in Little California"
  shi_resolve_power_struggle_desc:0 "The NCR are arrogant at best, an annoyance at worst.  While we’ve kept peace with the NCR for some time, we’ve accrued enough power to change the way we interact with our neighbours.  Debate surrounds the idea; shall we approach with an open palm or a closed fist?"

shi_ncr_golden_circle_trade:0 "The Golden Circle"
shi_ncr_golden_circle_trade_desc:0 "Our first contacts with the NCR have bore fruit.  They’ve struck a trade proposition; The Golden Circle.  Fortune favours the bold, and though many hold doubts in binding ourselves further with the NCR, it stands that to make honey, a bee needs a budding flower."
shi_fund_engineering:0 "Engineers Of Our Time"
shi_fund_engineering_desc:0 "“I must say, seeing these two factions work together through our mediation is interesting.  I have a plan to bring engineers from us and them together—a team of the greatest minds and tinkerers.  Old grudges aside, better to light a candle than to curse the darkness, isn’t that right?” —Doctor Xian"
shi_vertibirds:0 "Vertibirds At Dawn"
shi_vertibirds_desc:0 "The sky once again compels us.  Vertibird schematics line our collection, but Navarro is rumoured to have more that could accelerate our progress in air technology.  Our brightest can move quickly once Navarro is ours to claim these schematics, and our brightest engineers can piece them together in no time.  If only the Dragon could see us now."
shi_brotherhood_armor_advice:0 "An Armoured Fist, An Armoured Stance"
shi_brotherhood_armor_advice_desc:0 "Power Armour has been at every corner of our lives, but never has it been ours.  A cache of armour was found within the Navarro Territories.  Our researchers are thrilled to pick it apart and optimise the suits for our needs.  And our fighters?  They’re dreaming of what martial arts techniques can be translated with the suit."
shi_open_lo_pan_temple:0 "Gates To The Lo Pan Temple"
shi_open_lo_pan_temple_desc:0 "A bell tolls in the distance, announcing each new hour... \n\n Lo Pan sets his sights on nurturing the Shi to be the strongest they can; kings of kings.  A temple to train and pass these values is the path to strength."
shi_kill_hubologists:0 "Spin The Wheel"
shi_kill_hubologists_desc:0 "For too long have the children of the Star Father spoiled our achievements with their nonsensical dreams.  They’ve mistaken us for simple butterflies.  Let our string remind them of the bees."
shi_debate_over_social_heierarchy:0 "Lower The Walls Of Steel"
shi_debate_over_social_heierarchy_desc:0 "Feudalism was a product of honouring the traditions and customs of our ancestors.  But this has enabled figures to lurk and watch from the shadows.  This is no order of strength.  It is of cowards who cannot defend their positions themselves.  Let us write a new chapter."
shi_conquer_california:0 "What The Heart Knows, The Head Forgets"
shi_conquer_california_desc:0 "But like all animals, the Bear is nothing more than a beast to implode on itself.  It knows no friends.  Everything is food in its mind.  An alliance would be a wasted effort, their lands would fare better under us."
shi_ncr_friendship:0 "Beside Us, Brother Bear"
shi_ncr_friendship_desc:0 "Outdated moral traditions have been the bane of the Shi.  What came after the fall of the Dragon has proven the merits of cooperation.  The NCR is our friend, if not another hand to pave a way for our prosperity."
shi_contact_lost_hills:0 "Contact Lost Hills"
shi_contact_lost_hills_desc:0 "The elders at Lost Hills were impressed with how much our chapter had grown. Our growth might tip the scales in a possible conflict with NCR. And in order to ensure that growth continues to benefit the Brotherhood, they are sending us power armor blueprints."

  nf_shi.8.t:0 "Honour To Us All"
  nf_shi.8.d:0 "Some peasants claim the Emperor ruled since time immemorial, but the sages know we came on an ancient submarine during the Great War. Abandoned by the Mao Dynasty, we settled in the city of San Francisco, rebuilding what survived the war. \n\n We build a palace worthy of the Emperor from the submarine'sr ruins, the heart of Shi-Town."
  nf_shi.8.a:0 "The First Emperor brought knowledge of the sea."
  nf_shi.8.b:0 "The Emperor's wisdom guided our settlement."

  nf_shi.9.t:0 "When the Good Meet, Evil Keep Their Distance"
  nf_shi.9.d:0 "There was a time when bandits from the sea menaced all California. It fell to the least of us to journey across the waves to their prison on the water and destroy it. He battled our ancient foes, the Hubologists, and petitioned the Emperor for an audience. His victory lit up the sky, and he returned without a word. To this day there are those who light a candle in his name. For did he not provide us the secret of vertibirds?"
  nf_shi.9.a:0 "Seek knowledge, even from tribals."
  nf_shi.9.b:0 "And without coincidence there would be no stories."

  nf_shi.10.t:0 "Open Palm or Closed Fist?"
  nf_shi.10.d:0 "They called Lo Pen a bully, a gangster - but he was the one who welcomed the Chosen One to San Francisco. It was he who trained the hero of Navarro, not the Dragon. For both he and the Chosen One recognized that might makes right; not honour, not duty, not glory. Strength and skill are what matters. And that strength brought prosperity and comfort to the Shi.  Bandits are replaced by brahmin, and wanamingos by washing machines. Indeed, we prosper as bankers for much of the Republic, a place where few questions are asked and every service is provided. \n\nUnder Lo Pan and the Emperor, the Shi prospered. But there are those who mock our comfort. Shrines to ancestors fall into disarray; the new years' parade is an excuse for intoxication. And some even wonder if we need an emperor at all. The Dragon's disciplies still menace our people. They claim to fight injustice, but they harass the landlord, the merchant, the businessman. They mock our guests and menace foreign customers. Call them heroes? If they wish to be heroes, let them go fight the Legion. Under Lo Pen, all who wish for greatness, no matter their custom or country, have a chance."
  nf_shi.10.a:0 "Within the bounds of the four seas, all men are brothers."
  nf_shi.10.b:0 "But when the fence is strong, no men get in."

  nf_shi.11.t:0 "The First Round of Debate"
  nf_shi.11.d:0 "The Dragon and Lo Pan fought with words and deeds over the future of the Shi. To Lo Pan, the conflict shows the truth — people are submissive to power, and few of them can be influenced by righteousness. And with those words he slashed his katana into a Dragon School acolyte. \n\n "Not so," said Dr. Sheng as she roundhouse kicked a foe. “When the master governs, the people forget he exists. Next best is one who is loved. Then one who is feared. Worst is you, one who is despised.” \n\n "What victories will we gain through fear? What friends shall we make to keep us safe?" As she slammed another brigand with her bo staff the Doctor cried, "When we lack the people's faith, we resort to oaths. But when the best lead, the people will cry, we did it all ourselves." \n\n As the chaos raged, the Emperor's advisor, Ken Lee, watched the battle. Surely the Emperor would find this most interesting."
  nf_shi.11.a:0 "The state is strong when the leaders are strong."
  nf_shi.11.b:0 "The more you give, the wealthier you are."
  nf_shi.11.c:0 "The Emperor's calculations proceed."

  nf_shi.12.t:0 "The Greatest Gift is Friendship. The Next Greatest Is A Laser Gun."
  nf_shi.12.d:0 "It appears that the Shi wish to expand the Brotherhood's facility in San Francisco. Although generally we are opposed to working with outsiders with advanced technology, the Shi have a common interest in checking the Republic and we would be fools to say no. Perhaps they will serve us if the worst were to ever happen?"
  nf_shi.12.a:0 "The Codex will accomodate this, surely."

  nf_shi.13.t:0 "A Humble Request."
  nf_shi.13.d:0 "An envoy from the Shi has arrived with a request; caps for their endeavours.  It surprised many.  Seldom few opportunities have arisen where we’d brush paths with the Shi, no less have one of their own approach us.  Rumours and stories speak of their technological prowess—a force to be reckoned with had they bothered to step beyond their palace—and of the mystical vines that seemingly cleanse the air.  These legacies strike interest in many and fear in others.  Perhaps the Shi can make greater friends than foes?"
  nf_shi.13.a:0 "Fortune favours the generous!"

  #Home From The War
  nf_shi.14.t:0 "Leading The Homestead"
  nf_shi.14.d:0 "Once the outcome of the Navarro conflict seeped into the bones of the weary, the Shi raised existential questions.  How would they proceed from here?  What did they learn? \n\n Akigahai, with The Dragon’s teachings heavy in her heart, suggested they return to tradition.  Their older way of life had brought them here to begin with.  “These grounds are our home.  We fought for them, we bled for them.  Outsiders be damned.  This victory has proven our singular strength; that which was found under The Dragon.” \n\n Lo Pan took this as an opportunity to reinforce his beliefs once more.  Navarro’s fall reignited his passion to expand the Shi’s directions outwards—hand in hand with like minded factions of the wasteland.  “This victory has turned heads.  If people do not fear us, they admire us.  Let them know our name!” \n\n Ken Lee remained poised, as the Emperor’s advisor he denounced both oppositional forces.  “The both of you are getting too ahead of yourselves,” he remarked. “Must I remind you both, had Elder Francais not offered his wisdom to the Emperor, this victory would be nowhere glorious?  A soldier who forsakes his leader is but a walking weapon.”"
  nf_shi.14.a:0 "Lo Pan's conviction was unmatched."
  nf_shi.14.b:0 "Akigahai stood her ground, unrelenting."
  nf_shi.14.c:0 "The Emeperor remained in everyone's thoughts"

  #Thinking Of The Future
  nf_shi.15.t:0 "What Lies Ahead"
  nf_shi.15.d:0 "Ken Lee had a single argument he led the debate with; “So long as the Emperor rules, he will know what to do.  All his decisions are in the best interest of the Shi.  Always.  As such, he should continue to oversee our research operations.”  The fact that Ken held out for as long as he did with that point angered Lo Pan \n\n But Lo Pan would continue to argue his case, even if a flurry of fists would be thrice as effective.  “But should we let the Emperor make decisions without our say?  How is that fair?  Why must we follow a man in the shadows, hobbling to ourselves like the outside world doesn’t exist, when we can take that throne and do more?”  He rebuked, and his rage-laced arguments riled the people around him.  He bathed in smug satisfaction; heads were turning his way, nodding along. \n\n And in the heat of their debate a woman stepped in.  Akigahai—one of the last disciples of The Dragon.  After The Dragon’s fall, many of his disciples were shunned or had cast themselves away, but Akigahai remained, and she made sure people knew that fact.  Like her outstretched hands, her words reached out to the crowd—to the beliefs that were instilled, now lay dormant.  “Our honour and future can only be sustained by ourselves.  Should we forsake our traditions, then we can no longer call ourselves the Shi.”"
  nf_shi.15.a:0 "Lo Pan silenced the argument with his fist."
  nf_shi.15.b:0 "Akigahai swayed the crowd."
  nf_shi.15.c:0 "The Emperor could not be disputed"

  #Lower The Walls of Steel
  nf_shi.16.t:0 "Even Merchants Have Merit"
  nf_shi.16.d:0 "Under a canopy of sprawling vines that thrummed with absorbed radiation, the air was cleaner.  Rows of debates would acquaint the trio as rivals, if not fond enemies.  Another topic of debate arose, that of the Shi’s hierarchical society \n\n Lo Pan wanted nothing more to do with emperors or kings.  Akigahai, by rare feat, agreed with Lo Pan, but to herself she pondered what adjustments could be made to the preexisting system that would satisfy her vision.  Ken Lee opposed them, proposing that their hierarchical society kept everyone safe and productive.  Akighai wondered if the Brotherhood’s influences had caught up with Ken.  Lo pan was convinced that they had. \n\n  But instead of violent words and shouting, their debate was calm—a product of the jaded and strange familiarity built among the three.  They spoke over mahjong and bitter tea, and when it was over, a silent resolution loomed over them."
  nf_shi.16.a:0 "Lo Pan's won both the game and the debate."
  nf_shi.16.b:0 "Akigahai left the table with a smile."
  nf_shi.16.c:0 "Ken remained prominent and the last to leave."

  #The Legalist Debate
  nf_shi.18.t:0 "Conscious Be Damned"
  nf_shi.18.d:0 "The influx of legalism debates baffled Lo Pan.  Not that constructing law around moral belief was confounding, but now?  When they had greater things to work for upon the horizon?  Lo Pan figured his rule on the streets would set minds straight, but it seemed one fallen Dragon was not enough. \n\n Ken Lee, who had been seen frequenting the Brotherhood outposts in San Francisco,  was fascinated by the idea of constructing a special set of laws—honourable and just—for the Shi to follow.  Eerily, the laws he proposes were similar to that of the Brotherhood codex, though they were sensible and, by acclaim, Emperor-approved. \n\n Akigahai shared equal interest in officializing a set of moral laws for the Shi.  She vowed to uphold honour  and goodness in every aspect of her laws.  That of which transitioned their old cultural traditions to better fit the new world.  Her words struck the right tune to those who had missed the way things used to be and to others who were looking for comfortable change."
  nf_shi.18.a:0 "The strong rule.  End of story."
  nf_shi.18.b:0 "Humanity is built upon morals from our origins."
  nf_shi.18.c:0 "Trust in the Emperor."


  nf_shi.17.t:0 "Falling Star"
  nf_shi.17.d:0 "What to do with the powerhouse that neighboured the Shi was finally brought up to the pedestal.  The Shi had briefly brushed with the NCR before, but the topic of ‘dealing’ with them, whatever that entailed was up for debate, rose to popularity in tea-time chatter with a side of ‘friend-or-foe?’ osmanthus jelly.  But over the years of debates, trivials, and triumphs, the Shi people had but one person in mind who could lead the Shi through their dilemma. \n\n Would it be Lo Pan?  The king of the streets and the orchestrator of the Dragon’s fall?  He had been waiting for a chance to secure his position as the true leader of the Shi. \n\n Or Akigahai?  Rumour had it that she planned to challenge Lo Pan in singular combat.  For The Dragon, for the Shi. \n\n Perhaps it would be Ken Lee?  He had many ideas and had promised many things.  Beside him was both the Emperor and the Brotherhood in San Francisco, after all."
  nf_shi.17.a:0 "And then, after one final debate, came the answer."
