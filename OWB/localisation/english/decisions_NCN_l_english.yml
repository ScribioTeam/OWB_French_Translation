  farfield_revolt_mission:0 "Farfield Revolts!"
  farfield_revolt_mission_desc:0 "The tribes and misfits that reside in Farfield and the surrounding area have grown disenfranchised with our leadership. If we don't do something soon, we risk them launching an open revolt!"
  brigham_revolt_mission:0 "Brigham Revolts!"
  brigham_revolt_mission_desc:0 "Brigham and our northern settlements are composed of an eclectic mix of scavengers, entrepreneurs and traders. Whilst the settlements are nominally part of our domain, they are not Mormons. Recently, they have grown dissatisfied with our leadership, and if we don't address the issue soon we may face all-out revolt!"
  farfield_build_dwellings_wtt:0 "Build Dwellings in Farfield"
  farfield_build_dwellings_wtt_desc:0 "Farfield suffers from cramped conditions. Things are so bad many people are living in the ruined husks of pre-war dwellings or in tents under the starlight. If we put some of our consumer industry towards building reasonable dwellings, we could surely swing around some residents."
  farfield_build_dwellings_no_wtt:0 "Build Dwellings in Farfield"
  farfield_build_dwellings_no_wtt_desc:0 "Farfield suffers from cramped conditions. Things are so bad many people are living in the ruined husks of pre-war dwellings or in tents under the starlight.

  farfield_build_up_consumer_industry:0 "Build up Consumer Industry in Farfield"
  farfield_build_up_consumer_industry_desc:0 "If we were to divert some of our natural resources to the Farfield area, we could encourage production of civilian goods. It would probably even benefit us in the long run!"
  farfield_supply_local_markets:0 "Supply Southern Markets"
  farfield_supply_local_markets_desc:0 "Whilst most settlements are able to get everything they need to survive from the multitude of trader caravans that visit our lands, some luxury goods are all but unavailable outside of the capital. If we divert some of these goods to the south, we could surely heal some divisions between ourselves and them."
  brigham_provoke_war_scare:0 "Provoke a War Scare in Brigham"
  brigham_provoke_war_scare_desc:0 "If we were to conveniently forget about a naval landing exercise near to Brigham, we could frame it as a White Legs invasion. Surely Brigham wouldn't dare revolt if the White Legs might strike at them..."
  brigham_expand_garrisons:0 "Expand Northern Garrisons"
  brigham_expand_garrisons_desc:0 "One obvious way to show we still very much remain in control of the Northern borderlands is to expand the garrisons we have in local settlements and on the roadways. This will tie up men, but will certainly help discourage any ideas Brigham may be getting."
  brigham_build_up_industry:0 "Build Military Industry in Brigham"
  brigham_build_up_industry_desc:0 "A good way to show our military might and ensure Brigham stays loyal would be to build a new military workshop in Brigham. Let them be reminded of our power!"

  brigham_conduct_training_exercises_desc:0 "If we were to drill some of our tribal militias in our northern border regions, we could surely show off how well trained and equipped our military is."
  # Corruption

  ncn_corrupt_our_neighbors_desc:0 "Although obviously we want to save the souls of the other people of Utah, they will only open their hearts if they open their wallets to our fine good. The faith can go hand in hand with selling the finest pots and pans from New Canaan."
  corrupt_south:0 "Corrupt [FROM.GetNameWithFlag]"

  corrupt_south_tt:0 "[From.GETName] will become vulnerable to further influences..."

  ncn_conversion_daniel_sack_of_new_canaan_desc:0 "Persecution has not stopped the progress of truth, but has only added fuel to the flame. It has spread with increasing rapidity. Proud of the cause which they have espoused and conscious of our innocence and of the truth of their system, amidst calumny and reproach, have the elders of this Church gone forth and planted the gospel."
  convert_tribes_daniel_sack_1:0 "Convert [From.GetName]"
  convert_tribes_daniel_sack_ally:0 "Welcome [From.GetName] into the faith."
