  nf_oly.1.t:0 "The Boy Who Ran"
  nf_oly.1.d:0 "Two shadows raked the walls of the ruined acropolis. Carried by a decayed hand of skin and bones, a disk of oil-lit fire illuminated their path. Kept in pens were animals; would-be offerings for the Gods. \n\n"The Fates saw a lonely path in my string," the Shaman said to Hermes, his voice akin to nails against a chalkboard. "But it is my destiny to wait for the anointed. And for the few who arrive, there is always a story to tell." \n\nThey had called him the Soothsayer. The Harbinger of the Stars. He who burned for just a glimpse of the Gods and Goddesses beyond Elysium. But to Hermes the Shaman was a wayward scribe with an inkwell of sorrow and a world of canvas—a soul teetering between the mortal realm and Lethean fields. \n\n"I heard of you only through whispers," Hermes said, squaring his shoulders. "Apologies if I entertain skepticism." \n\n"No offense taken. I suppose we are different in that regard," chuckled the Shaman. "For the choir of the universe sings tales about you. I know much about you." \n\nHermes bristled, "That's far from flattering." \n\n"A child to a scrap worker. Who once was an ewe— Artemis-born— found his call with the wind. You were the boy who ran, and though your feet forget about the days of yore, your hands that had once slung arrows cannot," said the Shaman. He turned to Hermes, shining the fire to the wall adjacent. Scrawled on the stone were illustrations of wings and arrows in chalk. "But pray tell. Who are you now?""

  northern_league_bellingham_desc:0 "The Winterborn and his confidantes in Koover have always been neutral towards us, if not friendly. They were no friends of the Immortal themselves; perhaps they would hear our offering?"

  northern_league_syn_desc:0 "The Syilx have long-been oppressed by the monsters of Kamlo and what other darknesses lay in the north. Though they are strong in heart, mind, and body, we could achieve so much more together."
