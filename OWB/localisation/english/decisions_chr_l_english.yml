  chr_pestilent_breath_decision:0 "Unleash Pestilent Breath"
  chr_pestilent_breath_decision_desc:0 "Releases an extremely poisonous gas among our enemies that kills in about a minute. I think stuff like this used to be outlawed by someone?"

  chr_uktenas_gaze_decision_desc:0 "The enhanced mesmetron, codename Uktena's Gaze will overload our enemies brain and send subliminal messages at the same time.

  chr_ulusunti_bots_decision:0 "Use Ulun'suti Bots for Public Works"
  chr_ulusunti_bots_decision_desc:0 "Gaining some good will by improving the living standards of our citizens with our builder bots will go a long way in not having our nation implode around us the next time we release some scientific abomination."
