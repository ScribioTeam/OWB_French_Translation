  nf_genericbos.1.d:0 "While High Elder Maxson was the founder of the Brotherhood as a whole, each chapter has had its own founders, those that spread the word of the dangers of technology further into the Wasteland. Who were our founders?"
  nf_genericbos.1.d.mxc:0 "In the year 2231, Jeremy Maxson - the leader of the Western Brotherhood of Steel - decided to expand Brotherhood operations into the east to explore the Colorado region and assist the Midwestern Chapter's operations near Vault Zero. He sent an expeditionary force composed of five paladins to confirm the location of a rumoured bunker built by United States Senator Todd Peterson. The expedition leader, Andrea Brixley, discovered the bunker, disabled its security, and opened it for habitation. For over a decade she and her fellow paladins explored the east and forged relationships with many of the tribes that inhabited the area.\nIn the year 2242, Jeremy Maxson renamed the bunker after his famous ancestor, Roger Maxson. He then sent a full compliment of troops for occupation. Andrea Brixley was promoted to Elder, given the rank of General, and placed in charge. The remainder of her exploratory team was given the title of Elder as well.\nOf the original five founders of the Maxson Chapter which group of founders was the most prominent?."

  nf_genericbos.2.t:0 "Our Interim"
  nf_genericbos.2.d:0 "Each chapter of the Brotherhood has its own priorities. Some focus on collecting the powerful weapons of the Old World, while some prioritise the industrial machinery and tools. What did we focus on?"
  nf_genericbos.2.d.mxc:0 "It was not long after that fighting between the Maxson chapter and a resurgent Hangdogs began.\nThe Hangdogs are a group of tribal raiders stemming from Denver - "Dog City" as they call it.\nFor years the war waged on and was considered at advantage for the Maxson Chapter. However, no matter how many troops fell to the Brotherhood's superior technology, the Hangdogs always seemed to have more replacements available. The Brotherhood, however, was not so fortunate. Being an elitist group, replacements were short in arriving. It soon became obvious that the Brotherhood was doomed to lose the war to the Hangdogs greater numbers. Moral at the bunker began to falter as the war seemed more and more hopeless. Eventually the inevitable happened. Lower ranking members of the Brotherhood began to desert their posts!\nIt was only with the timely arrival of the Scorpion's Bite raiders from the south that the Maxson Chapter was sparred total annihilation. We have had a few decades to recover from that all-time low, and in the interim we have managed to learn from our losses and rebuild. What did we focus on during this period following this conflict?"
