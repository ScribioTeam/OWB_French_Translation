  BIG_CRYSTAL_BETH_DESC:0 "The Stampede is big, but we’re Biggar! If you asked Crystal Beth if things look bad for the gang she’d assure you that she understands the meta of warfare and is confident that you can win in any scenario if you maximize your strengths and minimize your weaknesses. She’d go on to tell you that her opponents are basically just a group of dumb robots that can barely provide her a challenge. Then she’d spend the next three days berating the rest of the gang on a violent chem binge."
