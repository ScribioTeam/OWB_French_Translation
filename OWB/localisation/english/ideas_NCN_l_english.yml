The caps they pay us in exchange for our services does go far..."
  ncn_idea_rapid_mobalisation:0 "Rapid Mobilisation"
  ncn_idea_rapid_mobalisation_desc:0 "The [WHT.GetName] threat is growing, and we are woefully unprepared for it. Without any real army, we stand little chance against the tribal hordes the [WHT.GetName] can field. We need to train our own units: and fast."

  ncn_idea_monetary_apathy:0 "Monetary Apathy"
  ncn_idea_monetary_apathy_desc:0 "Thanks to the constant preaching of Daniel, the congregation of New Canaan have become widely apathetic to money.

  ncn_idea_disrupted_economy:0 "Shattered Economy"
  ncn_idea_disrupted_economy_desc:0 "The war with the White Legs has shattered our economy into pieces. Every workshop was straining to deliver the demands of war, and now they seem unable to do much but produce weapons of war. The economy will take work to recover its past efficiency."

  ncn_idea_warmongering_disposition:0 "Warmongering Disposition"
  ncn_idea_warmongering_disposition_desc:0 "Our conquest of the White Legs has gained us vast swathes of territory, and a sour relationship with the tribes we preach amongst.

  ncn_idea_old_world_blues_desc:0 "Through the persistence of Daniel and the power of his reforms, a hybrid version of the old Church has been restored to New Canaan. Taking the best parts of the pre-war Church and combining it with our wasteland experience has made a Church for all people."
  ncn_idea_legal_drug_shipments:0 "Legal Drug Shipments"
  ncn_idea_legal_drug_shipments_desc:0 "Whilst it would never be palatable to the congregation to legalise drugs themselves, if drugs are kept in sealed containers there's surely no harm in them passing through our borders. The trade brings good money, after all..."

  ncn_decadence_dynamic_modifier:0 "Decadence's Clutches"
  ncn_decadence_dynamic_modifier_desc:0 "Slowly but surely, the Church has been taken over by caps and dirty secrets. Congregations are extravagant, and the clergy are wearing ever more opulent clothing. In time, it may hurt..."
