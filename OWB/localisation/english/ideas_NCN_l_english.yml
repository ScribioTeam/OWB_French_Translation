  ncn_idea_monetary_apathy:0 "Monetary Apathy"
  ncn_idea_monetary_apathy_desc:0 "Thanks to the constant preaching of Daniel, the congregation of New Canaan have become widely apathetic to money.

  ncn_idea_warmongering_disposition_desc:0 "Our conquest of the White Legs has gained us vast swathes of territory, and a sour relationship with the tribes we preach amongst.

  ncn_idea_legal_drug_shipments_desc:0 "Whilst it would never be palatable to the congregation to legalise drugs themselves, if drugs are kept in sealed containers there's surely no harm in them passing through our borders. The trade brings good money, after all..."

  ncn_decadence_dynamic_modifier:0 "Decadence's Clutches"
  ncn_decadence_dynamic_modifier_desc:0 "Slowly but surely, the Church has been taken over by caps and dirty secrets. Congregations are extravagant, and the clergy are wearing ever more opulent clothing. In time, it may hurt..."
