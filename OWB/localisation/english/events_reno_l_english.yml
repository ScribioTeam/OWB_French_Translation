  nf_reno.1.t:0 "The Biggest Little City in the Wasteland."
  nf_reno.1.d:0 "Before the atomic fire rained from on high? Reno was the biggest little city in the world! But now? Now it might just be the biggest city in the wasteland. To this day, the works and structures that survived the end of the world benefit us."
  nf_reno.1.a:0 "The sprawl survived, giving plenty of people a place to lay low!"
  nf_reno.1.b:0 "The Casinos Survived in a perfect Condition, good for business!"
  nf_reno.1.c:0 "The old military outposts survived, firearms for everyone!"

  nf_reno.2.t:0 "Pick a side?"
  nf_reno.2.d:0 "The world has become far more dangerous in the last few years! It's time for the bosses of New Reno to consider picking a side, if only for the sake of their business and safety. Many resist this notion however, as Reno has historically remained neutral."
  nf_reno.2.a:0 "Join the Nevada Pact?"
  nf_reno.2.b:0 "Reno remains neutral"
  nf_reno.2.c:0 "The NCR can protect our interests, and fuel our economy"

  nf_reno.3.t:0 "Rise of the remnants!"
  nf_reno.3.d:0 "Mason Salvatore's plans have finally come to fruition! In a night of supreme violence and bloodshed, hundreds of former Enclave Personal slaughtered his rivals in New Reno, butchering each of the great families. Unfortunately for Salvatore, the Enclave never intended to keep him around past this point, and his own organization also found itself on the firing line. Sergeant Dornan, the meanest man to grace the wasteland, has taken control of Reno. Time will tell as to whether or not this is part of a bigger plot..."
  nf_reno.3.a:0 "Sergeant Dornan takes control! For the Enclave, for Navarro!"

  nf_reno.4.t:0 "Rise of the Warlord!"
  nf_reno.4.d:0 "The bumbling criminal lords of Reno are no more! Thradd Reigns supreme here, as do his brothers! Hundreds of mutants, if not thousands, have flocked to New Reno in the past months, and the night before last, they rose up in an act of supreme and overwhelming violence, slaughtering all who would challenge them, while also stringing up and publicly executing each of the family heads. Wright was the last to die, horrified with what he had spawned. It is now the Warlord Thradd that rules Reno! Dozens of citizens are dragged away each hour and forcibly dunked in FEV, even as more and more mutants from across the wasteland rally to his call. His goal is simple, his words true. Thradd will avenge the Master! He will rekindle his project and save the Mutant Race! Any who stand between him and Mariposa have surrendered their lives."
  nf_reno.4.a:0 "All hail the Warlord! For the Master!"

  nf_reno.5.t:0 "Small Time Crime"
  nf_reno.5.d:0 "Not everything that happens in Reno happens because the men and women on top want it to. It's a free thinking place filled with entrepreneurs who are willing to do just about anything for a handful of caps. Some do better than others, and some? Some are legacies, minor institutions that have changed hands a dozen times, but still operate."
  nf_reno.5.a:0 "The Chop Shop is legendary for its stolen machines."
  nf_reno.5.b:0 "Who could forget the Cat's Paw? Oh, you only go for the ads?"
  nf_reno.5.c:0 "New Reno Arms! Spreading firepower to raiders for decades!"

  nf_reno.6.t:0 "Sex, Drugs or Rock and Roll!"
  nf_reno.6.d:0 "Our deal? Hell you know our deal. Living the life, living the dream, doing what you want, when you want, for as long as you can get away with it. Sex, Drugs, Rock'n'Roll! What else is there that you can want in a wasteland like this? Come on, forget who you are, forget where you are, and enjoy the party."
  nf_reno.6.a:0 "Sex!"
  nf_reno.6.b:0 "Drugs!"
  nf_reno.6.c:0 "Rock'n'Roll!"

  nf_reno.7.t:0 "The Top Dog?"
  nf_reno.7.d:0 "Everyone in Reno has been fighting for a piece of the pie for decades. Every one of the big families is looking to get a leg up on the others, to find a way to take control? But these days, only one of the families rules the streets. And you'd better fucking remember it, or you're in for one hell of a vacation? Aye bud?"
  nf_reno.7.a:0 "Mason Salvatore has regained power with outside help."
  nf_reno.7.b:0 "The Wrights have come far in the last few decades."
  nf_reno.7.c:0 "As if it were a question? The Bishops still rule the streets."
  nf_reno.7.e:0 "The Mordinos control the Jet, and they control the City."

  nf_reno.8.t:0 "New Klamath Agreements"
  nf_reno.8.d:0 "New Reno has been pursuing a more lucrative, but possibly more dangerous partnership. They wish to restore some of our production infrastructure in exchange for control of our civilian government."
  nf_reno.8.a:0 "We accept their offer."
  nf_reno.8.b:0 "Klamath will remain free."

  nf_reno.9.t:0 "An offer from the Warlord!"
  nf_reno.9.d:0 "The Warlord Thradd, who has recently claimed complete control over the city of New Reno, seeks our aid in his conquest of California. My Immortal, do we dare fall in line behind such a madman? This may be our only chance to fight mankind as a unified front, yet many within the tribe are uncertain if Thradd is a trustworthy ally."
  nf_reno.9.a:0 "We can't pass up this opportunity! The age mutants is here!"
  nf_reno.9.b:0 "I would never kneel to Thradd's will!"

  nf_reno.10.t:0 "Troll Warren Joins the Master's New Army"
  nf_reno.10.d:0 "We have received word from our tribal brothers in the north! The First shall join the Master's new army, in order to secure the future of our race! Their Strength shall be added to our own!"
  nf_reno.10.a:0 "Wonderful! The Master shall be avenged!"

  nf_reno.11.t:0 "Troll Warren Rejects us!"
  nf_reno.11.d:0 "My Lord! The First, in his supreme arrogance, has rejected our offers! He stands against mutant kind! Against the will of the Master! He must be crushed!"
  nf_reno.11.a:0 "And crush him we shall! None defy Thradd!"

  nf_reno.12.t:0 "An offer from the Warlord!"
  nf_reno.12.d:0 "Oh illustriously intelligent and all knowing Brain! The Warlord Thradd has come to us, and offered us a place in his new army! He seeks to crusade against Mankind, reclaiming the remains of his former Master's pathetic domain!"
  nf_reno.12.a:0 "An unexpected opportunity! We shall accept!"
  nf_reno.12.b:0 "Bah? His army shall share the same fate as the original."

  nf_reno.13.t:0 "The Brain Joins the Master's New Army!"
  nf_reno.13.d:0 "The Monstrous Lord of Vault City has accept our offer! Even now, his most capable warriors scramble to join our forces, and he begins the mass production of war machines for our efforts! He shall be a glorious ally indeed!"
  nf_reno.13.a:0 "The half breed made the right choice! Let him earn his place."

  nf_reno.14.t:0 "The Brain rejects our offer!"
  nf_reno.14.d:0 "The sniveling half breed cowards to the north have rejected our offers! Truly they are a foolish and selfish lot, unworthy of the title of mutant! We should teach the half breeds their place my warlord! We should crush them!"
  nf_reno.14.a:0 "Crush them? No! We'll enslave them!"

  nf_reno.15.t:0 "The Cult of Unity!"
  nf_reno.15.d:0 "Many within the army believe that bringing back the Cult of Unity will increase our odds of survival, and give purpose to the humies who are too weak or young to survive the transformation into super mutants! The advantages are clear, but those among the younger generation of mutant consider it a waste."
  nf_reno.15.a:0 "The Master would want this!"
  nf_reno.15.b:0 "Bah! Some of the weak survive!"

  nf_reno.16.t:0 "Accept Vault City into the Nevada Enclave?"
  nf_reno.16.d:0 "Vault City has expressed interest in joining our organization, and would certainly prove to be reasonable allies. Their technology and pure blooded nature make them the closest thing to acceptable citizens this wasteland has to offer the Enclave."
  nf_reno.16.a:0 "We accept their application!"
  nf_reno.16.b:0 "We reject their application!"

  nf_reno.17.t:0 "Vault City joins the Nevada Enclave!"
  nf_reno.17.d:0 "The men and women of Vault City have joined our cause, and now serve the Enclave and America! Let them be the first of many!"
  nf_reno.17.a:0 "America shall live again!"

  nf_reno.18.t:0 "Vault City earns our ire!"
  nf_reno.18.d:0 "The Men and Women of Vault City are unworthy of our cause! Their technology and people would better serve us!"
  nf_reno.18.a:0 "They are unworthy!"

  nf_reno.19.t:0 "Bunch of dumb-dumbs in New Reno!"
  nf_reno.19.d:0 "RHONDA: You're listening to UNC, the Utobithian News Channel, with breaking news! With us in the studio special guest star, Best Friend Tabitha!\nTABITHA: Apparently first-generation super mutants and a bunch of dumb-dumbs have taken over the city of New Reno!\nRHONDA: Ooh, how strange! But why would they do that instead of enjoying the safety and comfort that State of Utobitha provides?\nTABITHA: That's a good question, Rhonda!\nRHONDA: Thank you!\nTABITHA: Honestly, I think those dumb-dumbs are trying to imitate the ideal society we've built here, Rhonda! And I can't blame them! The State of Utobitha is free, safe, secure and centaur pet friendly!\nRHONDA: Ooh, I love the centaurs! They're just so cute!\nTABITHA: Exactly, Rhonda! Who could resist those sweet little faces, and that cute way they shuffle around on all those hands they have! Haha!\nRHONDA: You heard her, Utobitha! Let's go to the music..."
  nf_reno.19.a:0 "Huh?"

  nf_reno.20.t:0 "New Reno is overrun!"
  nf_reno.20.d:0 "After numerous reports of sudden disappearances, pillaging, and sightings of towering monstrosities on the horizon, our scouting party returns with only one man standing. Covered from head to toe in sweat, dirt, and blood; he mumbles breathlessly about his friends being reduced to bloody carcasses and ash. Worse still, the lone survivor delivers grim news. The capital of sin, New Reno, has been overrun by super mutants. Before falling unconscious, the scout repeats the words spoken to him as his life was spared. \"Reno is the land of giants now. Any and all who stand in our way shall either join Unity, or die.\""
  nf_reno.20.a:0 "Unity?!"
