  SLN_REL_OSSIN_NAME: "Rel-Ossin"
  SLN_REL_OSSIN_DESCRIPTION: "Son of Minishen and brother to the previous leader of S'Lanter, Rel-Ossin has been a leader marked with tragedy and controversy. The same illness that killed his sister claws at him, and many see it as a punishment by The Masters for breaking the line of succession. His steady personality and hopeful outlook make him a fair leader, but as his frame grows more frail, many wonder what the future holds for S'Lanter."
  SLN_TOP_LEADER_NAME: "Mayor Aeyr"
  SLN_TOP_LEADER_DESCRIPTION: "Nobody elected Aeyr the mayor of anything, but his charm and wit made him a charming presence amongst the Top Dwellers. He was seen as a refreshing spot of hope between the paranoid Den Dwellers and withering leadership. With Rel-Ossin's suffering at an end, Aeyr is ready to move S'Lanter into the future."
  SLN_DEN_LEADER_NAME: "Foreman Tok-Ar-Tok"
  SLN_DEN_LEADER_DESCRIPTION: "Tok-Ar-Tok has been the de facto leader of the Den Dwellers since before Rel-Ossin took over. He was a calm and steady presence during the reign of Rinar, but after her death he has grown more fearful and paranoid of the wraith of The Masters. Tok-Ar-Tok now sees the wasteland as a sea of threats and is prepared to dig S'Lanter into a fortification in order to survive."

  sln_an_escape: "Departure / Odyssey"
  sln_an_escape_desc: "The Masters created us. Elevated us from simple animals. The purpose of that act is unknown to us. Known is only that the Old Ones needed to leave the Masters' Glow. The journey lasted many lifetimes of our animal ancestors. It shaped us. Gave us insights into the world outside the Masters' Glow. It also almost killed us with it's harshness. Until we found the place that would become the Burrows."
  sln_an_encounter: "Encounter / Divide"
  sln_an_encounter_desc: "The first encounter with humans happened not long after we settled down. Now we know that is was pure chance that we encountered so few before. Maybe it was for the better. The humans, calling themselves \"Vipers\" gave credit to their name, behaving as if descended from animals themselves. Killing our kin, trying to enslave us. We fought, we prevailed. But the scars run deep."
  sln_a_draught: "Draught / Faith"
  sln_a_draught_desc: "After we lost the last of the Old Ones, it was as if the world grew angry at us about something out of our control. The trees we called our home grew sick, the river granting them and us life ran dry. We lost many to starvation and sickness. Minishen, son of the last Old One to leave us, told us about the Masters. How they created us strong and cunning, to survive the harsh world outside. We prevailed again."
  sln_a_question: "Question / No Answer"
  sln_a_question_desc: "Minishen's story rang true among many S'lanter. Especially the Den-Dwellers felt reassured in their beliefs. That they were created not to mimic the humans, but to be beyond them in body and mind. But some of the Top-Dwellers needed something more. They wanted to find the glowing place that Minishen told them off. To find the Masters and ask them: \"Why?\". What they found was not an answer."
  sln_a_death: "Death / Illness"
  sln_a_death_desc: "Rinar, daughter of Minishen, led us for many seasons. Then she fell ill. We were not able to cure her and she eventually succumbed to the disease. Having no children of her own, it was the first time that the mantle of leadership was not passed on from parent to child. Instead it passed to her brother, amidst growing discontent about this choice.\nThen he fell ill as well."

  sln_topdweller_1:0 "Trinkets"
  sln_topdweller_1_desc:0 "The tools we build to fit our hands are far too small for human use, but some humans find them to be amusing trinkets. We could sell our extra wares at local markets in exchange for the metal disks they use for currency."
  sln_topdweller_2:0 "Cobble"
  sln_topdweller_2_desc:0 "Our Den Dwellers just finished 2 new burrows, but they could pretty easily be converted to new workshops."
  sln_topdweller_3:0 "Control"
  sln_topdweller_3_desc:0 "Our Top Dwellers and Den Dwellers often spend hours negotiating the price of their raw goods. By allowing the Top Dwellers to set prices, we can increase our workload efficiency significantly."
 
  sln_dendweller_1:0 "Barricade"
  sln_dendweller_1_desc:0 "Our burrows and tunnels have made excellent traps in the past, so building more of these defensive structures should be a high priority."
  sln_dendweller_2:0 "Prepare"

  sln_dendweller_3_desc:0 "The Den Dwellers have a bold plan to convert some of the Top Dweller's buildings into bunkers by reinforcing them with soil and mud. Besides, why do the Top Dwellers need all those buildings anyway?"

  sln_dying_1:0 "Decay / Rebirth"
  sln_dying_1_desc:0 "Although there are days when Rel-Ossin can barely rise from bed, he knows that S'Lanter must continue to grow and prosper. With a stirring speech and a show of strength, a new construction effort begins."

  sln_dying_2_desc:0 "The small hands of the S'Lanter aren't built for the specialized tools humans use, but making new tools that fit our own strengths can make us more efficient tinkerers."
  sln_dying_3:0 "Foresight / Hope"
  sln_dying_3_desc:0 "Rel-Ossin's visions grow stronger everyday, but his journey will be impossible without the right tools. It is time to rally around our leader and build him the tools he needs to survive."

  sln_top_final_2:0 "Profits"
  sln_top_final_2_desc:0 "While the Den Dwellers toil away, Mayor Aeyr has found new markets for their goods. If caps buy the humans respect and peace, then S'Lanter needs the profits too!"

Tok-Ar-Tok now sees the wasteland as a sea of threats and is prepared to dig S'Lanter into a fortification in order to survive."
  sln_den_final_1:0 "Support"
