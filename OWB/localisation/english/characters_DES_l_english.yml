  DES_hell_razor_army_chief:0 "Hell Razor"
  DES_hell_razor_army_chief_desc:0 "Hell Razor hasn't changed much since ascending to the position of Ranger General; his tactics are still recklessly aggressive, and tend to garner the same results; massive casualties on both sides."

  DES_snake_vargas_high_command:0 "'Snake' Vargas"

  DES_jack_hidalgo:0 "Jack Hidalgo"
  DES_jack_hidalgo_desc:0 "Hidalgo was the leader of the Jackals, and like the starving scavengers they named themselves for, the jackals know how to survive with no resupply, no back up, and no reinforcements.

  DES_hell_razor_high_command:0 "Hell Razor"

  DES_Supplier:0 "Rusty"
  DES_Supplier_desc:0 "Known by a nickname of Rusty, his reputation as a fixer was legendary in northern Nevada for years.
