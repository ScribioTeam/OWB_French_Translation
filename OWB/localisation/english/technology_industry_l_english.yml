  tool_engineering:0 "Tool Procurement"
  tool_engineering_desc:0 "Our production facilities need tools — urgently. In order to maintain high production rates and supply our soldiers on time, our leaders have proposed two solutions: salvaging and simplification. Prioritising our salvaging teams would enable us to find and equip our workforce with the best tools available, whilst concentrating on simplifications in tool design would enable mass production of necessary equipment."

  maketool_engineering_1:0 "Improvised Tools"
  maketool_engineering_1_desc:0 "Using our basic understanding of toolmaking, we can use the materials in the immediate environment of our workshops to improvise basic tools on the fly. While the results are hardly impressive; using scrap metal knives, rebar clubs, and other basic tools is much more effective than simply using our hands for everything.\n\n"
  maketool_engineering_2:0 "Basic Tools"
  maketool_engineering_2_desc:0 "Stone is the bedrock of the world — literally. Stone tools are the crucial first step towards civilisation, or in our case, greater production efficiency. Improving on our primitive, improvised designs by incorporating ergonomics and greater reliability will make our tools easier to use and maintain."
  maketool_engineering_3:0 "Standardised Tools"
  maketool_engineering_3_desc:0 "Standardised tool designs can be quickly manufactured with widespread blueprints, and used interchangeably between labourers. Gone are the days of individual tool designs with their quirks and advantages. What we lose in personalised ergonomic design we gain in nation-wide, standardised equipment, designed to perform its role as effectively as possible in anyone’s hands."
  maketool_engineering_4:0 "Refined Tools"
  maketool_engineering_4_desc:0 "As our equipment becomes more advanced, so too must the tools which produce it. Refining our designs to assuage the need for precise tools our workforce now faces, while keeping the basic mechanisms as simple as possible, will allow us to increase efficiency without inflating production times."
  maketool_engineering_5:0 "Advanced Tools"
  maketool_engineering_5_desc:0 "The time has come to modernise the armoury of our nation’s labourers. Controlled bolting tools such as torque wrenches, bolting pumps, and tensioners will form the backbone of our armour production industry. New stamping tools will enable rapid mass production of small arms on an unprecedented scale. These tools, and many more like them, will bring our factory workers one step closer to the old-world."
  maketool_engineering_6:0 "Pre-war Tools"
  maketool_engineering_6_desc:0 "With the aid of our nation’s finest, we have been able to restore, rebuild, and replicate tools of the pre-war. Our labourers carry tools that other nations would idolise as standardised equipment: the atom powering their efforts to create the finest equipment known to man. From fusion powered plasma cutters, to Saturnite drills — our workers use science to give our soldiers the best equipment possible."

  scavtool_engineering_1:0 "Scavenged Tools"
  scavtool_engineering_1_desc:0 "Prospectors and armed guards can be sent out in search of salvageable pre-war factories, bags in hand, to strip their interiors of any and all useful equipment. Dead men need no tools. With these tarnished pre-war implements at their disposal, our craftsmen can make superior equipment out of more durable materials.\n\n"
  scavtool_engineering_2:0 "Tracking Dogs"
  scavtool_engineering_2_desc:0 "Hounds can be trained for a number of purposes: chief among them hunting and tracking. By raising and training dogs to recognise the scents of industrial chemicals, oil, tool steel, etc; we can more easily find and explore pre-war deposits likely to contain undiscovered equipment."
  scavtool_engineering_3:0 "Quadrant Searching"
  scavtool_engineering_3_desc:0 "Rather than searching sites of interest as they please, our prospectors can instead adopt a search tactic used prominently by pre-war investigators. Splitting large areas up into numerous smaller quadrants, each prospector can now search their zone for salvage in an orderly fashion. This turns larger areas into manageable smaller chunks: making for efficient and productive scavenging."

  pre_agriculture_industry_tech:0 "Organised Agriculture"
  pre_agriculture_industry_tech_desc:0 "An organized agricultural system based on more than the need of our people will help a lot if a cataclysm were to happen, and allow us to have reserves and cultivate more varied crops. Such a system is essential to the survival of our people."

  agriculture_industry_tech_1:0 "Seed Selection"
  agriculture_industry_tech_1_desc:0 "Seed selection is the process of selecting which seeds while be planted based on varying self determined criteria. These include, possible yield, resistance against diseases and other environmental threats and nutritional value just to name a few."
  agriculture_industry_tech_2:0 "Plant Cultivation"
  agriculture_industry_tech_2_desc:0 "Cultivation, Loosening and breaking up (tilling) of the soil. The soil around existing plants is cultivated (by hand using a hoe, or by machine using a cultivator) to destroy weeds and promote growth by increasing soil aeration and water infiltration."
  agriculture_industry_tech_3:0 "Crop Rotation"
  agriculture_industry_tech_3_desc:0 "Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of dissimilar or different types of crops in the same area in sequenced seasons. It is done so that the soil of farms is not used for only one set of nutrients. It helps in reducing soil erosion and increases soil fertility and crop yield. "
  agriculture_industry_tech_4:0 "Irrigation"
  agriculture_industry_tech_4_desc:0 "Irrigation is the application of controlled amounts of water to plants at needed intervals. Irrigation helps to grow agricultural crops, maintain landscapes, and revegetate disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of less than average rainfall."
  agriculture_industry_tech_5:0 "Industrial Fertilizer"
  agriculture_industry_tech_5_desc:0 "The Haber process, also called the Haber–Bosch process, is an artificial nitrogen fixation process and is the main industrial procedure for the production of ammonia. Ammonia is a vital component of industrial fertilizers. Though Ammonia can also be gained through Brahmin Dung."
  agriculture_industry_tech_6:0 "Automated Harvesting"
  agriculture_industry_tech_6_desc:0 "The process of harvesting plant produce has always been an arduous, but now with the aid of robotics will this challenge dwindle away, once more giving rise to higher productivity."
  agriculture_industry_tech_7:0 "Genecrops"
  agriculture_industry_tech_7_desc:0 "Genetically modified crops are plants used in agriculture, the DNA of which has been modified using genetic engineering methods. In most cases, the aim is to introduce a new trait to the plant which does not occur naturally in the species."

  basic_industry_tech:0 "Industry Planning"
  basic_industry_tech_desc:0 "Even though scattered workshops have fulfilled our need thus far, we cannot go further into improving our system without industrial planning. While the specifics are not decided yet, regrouping them and encouraging cooperation between each one should already provide us with benefits and pave the way for further reform."

  generalized_industry_tech_1:0 "Work as Needed"
  generalized_industry_tech_1_desc:0 "Working based on demands and not quotas provides numerous advantages. Doing so allows us to react faster to changes from the frontline, as we are more in touch with what our soldiers need, and we can thus more easily switch the required production. It also frees up parts of the workforce to join the battle, if the need is ever present."
  generalized_industry_tech_2:0 "Local Workspaces"
  generalized_industry_tech_2_desc:0 "Instead of pulling populations away from villages, and into our factories, we can set up a system of local workshops, letting our people work without leaving their family and loved ones. Combined with regular supply convoys that also take in any produced goods to a more centralized location, this increases the flexibility of our industry as whole villages can be dedicated to manufacturing a specific equipment, letting them become more skillful in their field of expertise."
  generalized_industry_tech_3:0 "Public Projects"
  generalized_industry_tech_3_desc:0 "Public projects dedicated to improving the lives of the people in cities and villages will let them have better habitations and sanitation systems, while the open access to anyone to work on simple parts of the projects will have them gain basic skills in engineering and instill work discipline as well as appreciation of hard labour into all of our population."
  generalized_industry_tech_4:0 "Backyard Workshops"
  generalized_industry_tech_4_desc:0 "Massive distribution of tools and some materials to all interested individuals lets them form their own backyard workshops, spurring innovation to increasing heights while the close proximity of such workshops will let anyone, even the wounded or elderly, participate in the war machine. Special courses dedicated to teaching children the values of hard work and innovation will spur our future generations to work even harder."
  generalized_industry_tech_5:0 "Rapid Prototyping"
  generalized_industry_tech_5_desc:0 "Studies of pre-war CNC machines and basic electronics allow us to equip every single one of our factories with rapid prototyping sub-sections. Such sub-sections possess intuitive machine tools letting any worker propose and then test any improvements they think could be made to a particular item. It allows unrivaled level of ingenuity and continuous improvement to our manufacturing methods."
  generalized_industry_tech_6:0 "Three Dimensional Printers"
  generalized_industry_tech_6_desc:0 "Three dimensional printers are an extention of our rapid prototyping machines. Sporting a computer interface and easy to use tools, they allow much easier experiments aiming to simplify production. Some larger models are even used to replace entire production lines by themselves!"
  generalized_industry_tech_7:0 "Replicators"
  generalized_industry_tech_7_desc:0 "Replicators are the pinnacle of our manufacturing doctrine. A blueprint is first designed on an industrial workstation before being transfered to the replicator, giving us perfect copies of the intended items. This allows literally no flaws in our system what so ever, extremely fast changes to the desired item production, and efficiency on a level previously thought unthinkable."

  specialized_industry_tech_1:0 "Work Assignments"
  specialized_industry_tech_1_desc:0 "Working via a system of quotas and production targets let us work at a much better pace and manufacture more equipment in a given time, wasting none on simplifications. As it should be, as our equipment engineers should be in charge of that. Our production lines work at maximum capacity in this manners, but are somewhat inefficient when it comes to sudden manufacturing changes."
  specialized_industry_tech_2:0 "Dedicated Workshops"
  specialized_industry_tech_2_desc:0 "Dedicated workshops set up in our industrial centers as well as recruitment drives to staff them improves our capabilities further, as the centralization of supplies, resources and manpower makes it much easier for quantities of weapons and armor to be produced at a rapid pace."
  specialized_industry_tech_3:0 "Artisan Guilds"
  specialized_industry_tech_3_desc:0 "Guilds formed by the most skillful of our workforce can reinforce our current system as well as provide knowledge and training to other members of the factory. Dedicated sections with the purpose of helping the most elite of them tinker with our devices and tools will improve yield."
  specialized_industry_tech_4:0 "Dedicated Factories"
  specialized_industry_tech_4_desc:0 "Purpose-built industrial buildings with high standards in cooling and ventilation will let us provide more staff and machinery in each of them. This will centralize our production further, improve worker health as well as reliability, and even give us manufacturing lines capable of producing dozens of items a day."
  specialized_industry_tech_5:0 "Assembly Lines"
  specialized_industry_tech_5_desc:0 "True assembly lines consist of workers acting as cogs in a well oiled machine. Each device we seek to manufacture is put on a moving belt and staff is scattered a different points of said belt. They each add one element, or inspect one part of the device, thus maximising the efficiency of each and every one of them. Industrial output vastly benefits from such measures."
  specialized_industry_tech_6:0 "Robotic Workers"
  specialized_industry_tech_6_desc:0 "Replacing human hands by mechanical ones can vastly improve the speed and precision of each step of the manufacturing line, insuring no stoppage or waste during the production process. With the staff now reduced to only maintenance personel, this also eliminates most labor requirement."
  specialized_industry_tech_7:0 "Standard Technology Construct"
  specialized_industry_tech_7_desc:0 "Standardized and detailed digital blueprints improved upon by all of our super factory's design teams, and loaded into our robotics assembly lines, allow extremely high quotas to be met with close to no efforts. Vehicles can be manufactured in minutes and weapons in seconds. Bullets and energy cells can be made by the thousands. We will never run out of ammunition, and the enemy will very quickly be aware of that fact."

  extraction_industry_tech_1:0 "Work Camps"
  extraction_industry_tech_1_desc:0 "Much less harsh than it sounds, work camps seek to provide an outpost close to natural resources or salvaging sites from which our workers can rest, plan and work while not under the harsh desert sun or at the mercy of the weather."
  extraction_industry_tech_2:0 "Dedicated Equipment"
  extraction_industry_tech_2_desc:0 "Dedicated mining equipment such as explosives, survey charges and pickaxes will allow our prospectors to work much faster and get more resources out of every work shift."
  extraction_industry_tech_3:0 "Steam Powered Extraction"
  extraction_industry_tech_3_desc:0 "Steam-powered extraction devices, while cumbersome, provide a very good alternative to manual labour. Such machines do not need rest beyond some cooling downtime, and also replace prospectors who have to work harsh jobs in terrible temperatures."
  extraction_industry_tech_4:0 "Electrical Extraction"
  extraction_industry_tech_4_desc:0 "Switching the steam-powered system, demanding specialized training for safe boiler manipulations as well as protective equipment, with electrical machinery simplifies extraction of resources, and allow our machines to be powered by standard energy cells."
  extraction_industry_tech_5:0 "Robotic Extraction"
  extraction_industry_tech_5_desc:0 "Robots with drills and pneumatic hammers instead of arms, as well as specialized digging protocols, can tunnel and smash through obstacles at a rapid pace. This allows resource extraction to reach peak efficiency with minimal material waste."

  pre_construction_industry_tech:0 "Construction Basics"
  pre_construction_industry_tech_desc:0 "The basics of construction go back to the dawn of humankind, but it's good to revisit them from time to time. It would be preposterous to imply we don't know how to build huts, but some inquiries are necessary to know how to properly design the most basic of factories and roads."

  construction_industry_tech_1:0 "Woodworking"
  construction_industry_tech_1_desc:0 "Wood is the simplest material around, and has been used by our population for generations. The main aim of this research project is to get proper layouts for all types of defensive or utilitarian constructs we would want to build. It would be good if the wooden factory producing explosives wouldn't be simply glossed over."
  construction_industry_tech_2:0 "Clayworking"
  construction_industry_tech_2_desc:0 "Clay is a more uniform material, offering better protection against the elements and the heat than wood. It is also slightly more sturdy, and allows us to progress as a people by going from wooden planks used as plates to clay bowls."
  construction_industry_tech_3:0 "Metalworking"
  construction_industry_tech_3_desc:0 "Metalworking was known since a while, but producing metal on a large enough scale to reinforce our buildings with them and make them more sturdy constructs is another matter entirely. Foundry and shaping workshops will be needed, but having armored bunkers and outpost to keep undesirables out will be worth it."
  construction_industry_tech_4:0 "Bricks"
  construction_industry_tech_4_desc:0 "Bricks laid together with mortar form a good foundation for all of our civilian buildings and factories, giving us the opportunity to build our first true buildings and houses."
  construction_industry_tech_5:0 "Cement and Concrete"
  construction_industry_tech_5_desc:0 "Cement and concrete are more resistant to damage and weather than simple bricks. Able to be reinforced with rebar to create a construction material capable of taking tension, pressure or anything else people might throw at it, it is also much easier to mold or shape."
  construction_industry_tech_6:0 "Composites"
  construction_industry_tech_6_desc:0 "Composite materials are the best of both world. Light, easy to lay, simple to work with and yet sturdy, resistant and breathable. Buildings can be constructed in only a couple of months with techniques that even some pre-war nations would be jealous of."

  habitation_industry_tech_1:0 "Tribal Huts"
  habitation_industry_tech_1_desc:0 "Simple huts build on a more numerous scale should let us shelter even the weakest elements of our civilization from the harshes of the waste, which form the basis of any civilization worth of this name."
  habitation_industry_tech_2:0 "Adobe Housing"
  habitation_industry_tech_2_desc:0 "Adobe housings are more suited to the wasteland. Camouflaging with the terrain as well as keeping the scorching heat outside, such dwellings let us provide more comfort to our people and have more sturdy habitations."
  habitation_industry_tech_3:0 "Scrap Shacks"
  habitation_industry_tech_3_desc:0 "Shacks made of bolted scrap metal might not look like much, but it allows us to have more and more luxuries while being protected of outside threats."
  habitation_industry_tech_4:0 "Brick Housing"
  habitation_industry_tech_4_desc:0 "Actual planned and designed housings made of brick, these are the very best we can do currently for our people without needing some serious technological leaps. Still, those habitations are miles above what most wastelanders have, and many would never have thought they would have such luxuries after the bombs fell."
  habitation_industry_tech_5:0 "Pre-War Housing"
  habitation_industry_tech_5_desc:0 "Advances in manufacturing capabilities have allowed us to reach a point no one would have thought possible. We have revived the standard of living of pre-war American and provided it to our people. Already they cannot believe such a feat and marvel at such things as fridges and actually comfortable beds, yet we can go further."
  habitation_industry_tech_6:0 "Home of the Future"
  habitation_industry_tech_6_desc:0 "This is it. The most advanced housing we can ever provide. Every function is automated, every single part of it designed for comfort and protection, and even householding robots are now a thing again. The people cannot thank us enough, and we have the most advanced buildings in the entirety of the wasteland, if not the world!                      I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."

  pre_recycling_industry_tech:0 "Multipurpose Equipment"
  pre_recycling_industry_tech_desc:0 "Equipment designed with interchangeable tool heads or devices in their handle allows us to have all the tools we need with much less efforts both in manufacturing them and working with them."
  recycling_industry_tech_1:0 "Flexible Designs"
  recycling_industry_tech_1_desc:0 "Having our weaponry able to be fed multiple types of ammunition as well as be more resistant to wear will increase the flexibility of our soldiers in the field."
  recycling_industry_tech_2:0 "Part Standardisation"
  recycling_industry_tech_2_desc:0 "Standardising the parts used in our military equipment and making them be easily accessible and switchable will considerably decrease maintenance time for each and every weapon, armor or vehicle we field."
  recycling_industry_tech_3:0 "Recycling"
  recycling_industry_tech_3_desc:0 "Making use of parts in good conditions in our busted military equipment will lessen the strain on our supply systems, while scavenging networks will let soldiers easily have access to replacements."
  recycling_industry_tech_4:0 "Advanced Recycling"
  recycling_industry_tech_4_desc:0 "Making use of every single available part and having extensive dismantling procedures to return products to their basic components allows us to use every equipment to the limit."

  resource_generator_tech:0 "Resource Production"
  resource_generator_tech_desc:0 "While scavenging is a good way to get by, it cannot produce everything we need to supply our nation. We will need to design actual buildings entirely dedicated to resource production and go beyond being just scavengers."

  resource_generator_water_tech_1:0 "Basic Well Pumps"
  resource_generator_water_tech_1_desc:0 "A basic pump connected to underground water sources deep enough to not have been irradiated will let our citizens have access to radiation-free water. Clean water is another thing entirely, sadly."
  resource_generator_water_tech_2:0 "Advanced Well Pumps"
  resource_generator_water_tech_2_desc:0 "More advanced well pumps equipped with bigger pipes, as well as a very simply filtration systems to prevent the biggest impurities to be drank by our citizens, will improve general health and let them gain access to semi-clean water."
  resource_generator_water_tech_3:0 "Basic Aquifer"
  resource_generator_water_tech_3_desc:0 "A powered water pump with better distilling equipment lets us support a larger population, while general health continues to increase as cooking and drinking can be done with somewhat clean and radiation-free water."
  resource_generator_water_tech_4:0 "Advanced Aquifer"
  resource_generator_water_tech_4_desc:0 "A better engine linked to the water pump along with ever more precise water filters and easier repairs for isolated communities let almost our entire population enjoy clean water."
  resource_generator_water_tech_5:0 "Purified Aquifer"
  resource_generator_water_tech_5_desc:0 "A chemical two-stage purification system capable of cleaning even wasteland surface water, all connected to an underground pipeline, allows us to be one of the only nations in the wasteland to have entirely clean water right in our very homes."

  resource_generator_power_tech_1:0 "Basic Generator"
  resource_generator_power_tech_1_desc:0 "Basic wind-driven dynamo with a hand-cranked fall-back system can provide some of our facilities with temporary energy, and allows some of our citizens to even have lighting."
  resource_generator_power_tech_2:0 "Advanced Generator"
  resource_generator_power_tech_2_desc:0 "A more advanced generator linked to a battery and energy capacitor let us store power to use later, and while private use of power is rationed, more and more of our citizens can afford to have a single light on in their homes, bringing some comfort in such troubling times."
  resource_generator_power_tech_3:0 "Basic Power Plant"
  resource_generator_power_tech_3_desc:0 "A power plant running on a chemical two-stage engine allows constant power production as long as fuel is provided, which lets us power ever more demanding machinery and improve the lives of our people."
  resource_generator_power_tech_4:0 "Advanced Power Plant"
  resource_generator_power_tech_4_desc:0 "Better capacitors with less wasted energy and more fuel-efficient generators can now let us use pre-war technology, and even provide everyone with enough power to turn the lights on or have some electrical apparatus."
  resource_generator_power_tech_5:0 "Nuclear Reactor"
  resource_generator_power_tech_5_desc:0 "A nuclear reactor using miniaturized cores as well as a vast power network linked to every home in our cities let our citizens enjoy the very best such marvels can offer, while our factories run at peak efficiency."

  resource_generator_metal_tech_1:0 "Basic Smeltery"
  resource_generator_metal_tech_1_desc:0 "A very basic smeltery consisting of nothing but a crucible and beak let us melt down scraps to their basic components to then be better used for production of various goods."
  resource_generator_metal_tech_2:0 "Advanced Smeltery"
  resource_generator_metal_tech_2_desc:0 "Experience with the art of smelting and careful cleaning of each metal destined to be melted down to remove any impurities or improper alloys let us get higher yield, as well as better quality, out of each production cycle."
  resource_generator_metal_tech_3:0 "Basic Foundry"
  resource_generator_metal_tech_3_desc:0 "A foundry allowing us to manufacture cast pieces for our armor and vehicles, such apparatus are much more effective and can even somewhat clean impurities from the metal by themselves, even if uneven armors and smelting flaws are still present."
  resource_generator_metal_tech_4:0 "Advanced Foundry"
  resource_generator_metal_tech_4_desc:0 "A more advanced foundry, as well as specialized equipment and better training, have allowed us to manufacture rolled homogenous plates, an armor plating with even surface and very little weak spots to talk of. With it also comes advanced casting capabilities, making it much easier to produce large metal plating or advanced devices such as armoured turrets."
  resource_generator_metal_tech_5:0 "Autonomous Foundry"
  resource_generator_metal_tech_5_desc:0 "Entirely autonomous handling of every task from triage to smelting or even casting, done by worker robots, allows unprecedented level of metal and alloy production to fuel our military factories with."

  resource_generator_circuitry_tech_1:0 "Fabrication Laboratory"
  resource_generator_circuitry_tech_1_desc:0 "Relying on salvage operations might be all well and good for some nations, but now we must increase our supply of computing parts beyond what simple scavenging could give. Setting up laboratories entirely dedicated to the construction of all-glass vacuum tube can finally allow us to manufacture a vital resource, distinguishing us from less advanced nations."
  resource_generator_circuitry_tech_2:0 "Compression Chambers"
  resource_generator_circuitry_tech_2_desc:0 "Our previous manufacturing plants have been found to be vastly inefficient. Indeed, their limited production capabilities only allow us to produce clunky, partially vacuumed components, leading to poor manufacturing cycles and even worse reliability. Installing proper compression and absorbtion chambers let us create a new, high-vacuum design, vastly enhancing our computing capabilities."
  resource_generator_circuitry_tech_3:0 "Etching Solutions"
  resource_generator_circuitry_tech_3_desc:0 "Vacuum computing is still to this day an incredibly advanced technology, hard to replicate and harder to use, yet strangely it seems like our scientist have found an alternative method of computing. Crazy experiments and weird ramblings barely understood by our engineers keep mentioning "circuit boards" and "printed computing". While it's clearly crazy talk, we could associate most of the sound concepts into our current manufacturing methods for higher efficiency."

  vault_industry_tech:0 "Vault Tech Infrastructure"
  vault_industry_tech_desc:0 "The vaults are a magnificent example of pre-war engineering, and we would do well to understand all we can about them. By closing some sub-sections and disassembling as much we can from them, we could not only salvage non-critical components to reverse engineer, but also learn more about pre-war construction techniques."
  vault_medical_tech:0 "Vault Healthcare"
  vault_medical_tech_desc:0 "With medical stocks made to last for but a few decades, reserves couldn't have been sufficient for Vaults to insure proper long term healthcare. Closer study of remaining medication has revealed multiple solutions. Diluted liquids, heavy use of passive healing, and low-level chemical manufacturing to name some. Applying theese methods to our own production process will let us make widespread use of medicine, instead of having to save them for extreme cases."
  vault_manufacturing_tech:0 "Vault Manufacturing Equipment"
  vault_manufacturing_tech_desc:0 "Underground production is not a simple affair, owing to the cramped nature of such activities. Yet Vault Tec made fascinating adaptations to available machinery to counter these problems. Passive cooling, miniaturization, reliability upgrades, as well as improved safety measures are all changes observed. In a weird twist of event, these machines are the safest and easiest to use we've ever seen, but we can safely assume as an explanation that a limbless worker is not a very good specimen."
  vault_efficiency_tech:0 "Vault Recyling Methods"
  vault_efficiency_tech_desc:0 "Vault Tec's recycling technology is more advanced than any we've ever seen. Wastes are collected and purified in a close-pipe system, food scraps broken down into snack bars, and all electrical assemblies are made for high-efficiency transmission. Even more astonishing, things as simple as blast furnaces are equipped with top gas recycling devices. Applying only a few of those advancements onto our own infrastructure could massively increase our production efficiency."

  underground_industry_tech:0 "Underground Expansion"
  underground_industry_tech_desc:0 "As the surface becomes more and more occupied, the need for living space rises steadily. While an easy matter in concept, underground construction is no game. Applying our knowledge of Vault Tec bunkers to begin construction of multiple underground facilities could not only increase our overall production, but also simplify supply transport, management, and provide a base upon which we can rely in case of a population boom."

  underground_hydroponics_tech:0 "Underground Hydroponics"
  underground_hydroponics_tech_desc:0 "The installation of hydroponic sub-sections to our underground complex is a very difficult endeavor, but one that is more than worth it. Artifical atmosphere and specialized chemicals provide plants with a perfect environment to grow and produce a steady supply of healthy, fresh food. This would allow us to move some of our workforce underground, and any surplus in production can be shared with the surface! Just don't look too closely at the tomatoes, alright?"
  underground_ventilation_tech:0 "HEPA 20 Cartridge Filter"
  underground_ventilation_tech_desc:0 "Installing high-quality HEPA 20 filters, manufactured from recovered blueprints, can yields huge improvement to our underground complexes's air quality. Some might question why a simple air filter is so important, but they rapidly understand once the stale, thrice-recycled air is replaced by a fresh, cool breeze. This would improve the health of our workers, increasing overall production, and some might even decide to work longer shifts simply to enjoy it before returning to the surface."
  underground_security_tech:0 "Advanced Lockdown Protocols"
  underground_security_tech_desc:0 "Concentric defense lines, mines, machinegun nests, and multiple hidden surface exit points all allow us to wage warfare on our soil with vastly increased capabilities. We can not only stay on the defensive and enjoy the firework whenever the pieces of scrap they call vehicles roll on a mine, but also organize large-scale assault behind their lines at any moment. And if the enemy ever manage to find one of our entrances? They'll enjoy the flamethrower defense posts, no doubt."
