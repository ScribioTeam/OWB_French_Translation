  nf_event_sr.1.t:0 "The Victors of Wounded Knee"
  nf_event_sr.1.d:0 "The Sioux make up seven tribes, who once lived from Wisconsin in the east to Wyoming in the west. Mighty warriors who dominated trade between the Plains and east, the Sioux feared no one. Until the United States Army poured west, taking land as it went. In the 1870s the Sioux tried to save the Black Hills, and stopped Custer at the Battle of Wounded Knee.  But ultimately the weight of numbers told were too much of a burden to carry, and the Sioux signed a series of treaties forcing them into reservations.  The United States government created the Standing Rock reservation by breaking up the Great Sioux Reservation, which dominated Western South Dakota. Standing Rock became home to Dakota and Lakota, members of the Sioux people. But until the bombs fell, Standing Rock had little to boast of. The prewar government lay pipelines through the Reservation over the tribes' consent, and granted mining rights to American corporations.  "
  nf_event_sr.1.a:0 "Some of that mining equipment was salvageable."
  nf_event_sr.1.b:0 "As was experience from protests and resistance."

   nf_event_sr.2.t:0 "The Seven Fires Smouldering"
  nf_event_sr.2.d:0 "In the years before the end, the government's exploitation of Indian land only intensified. A dying empire scoured their lands for potential resources, while pipelines from occupied Canada passed through tribal lands without their consent. Abraxo's chemical spill in the Dakotas finally pushed the tribes to revive the Seven Council Fires, a loose alliance of the Dakota, Nakota, and Lakota peoples. Harassed by the FBI before the Great War, the Seven Fires managed to keep the tribes together and united when the world ended.  For a hundred and fifty years, the Seven Fires kept the peace in the Northern Commonwealth, working with the Historians and others to control the region. That ended twenty years ago. \n\nThe Seven Councils were under pressure even before the Massacre of '63. An outbreak fo the Blue Flu imposed lockdowns, while the First Families and their new allies pushed raiders east. But in 2263, a Storm Monger Raid, in their ancient vertibirds and armor dark as night, fell like the black snake Uncegila upon the council. In the chaos, the tribes blamed each other; and the Fires burned out. Only Standing Rock stayed together."
  nf_event_sr.2.a:0 "We will never forget this tragedy."
  nf_event_sr.2.b:0 "But we will get justice."

  nf_event_sr.3.t:0 "The Daughter of Sitting Bull"
  nf_event_sr.3.d:0 "Shappa is, even for the younger generation, a woman of action. She's led trading expeditions to Great Falls, treated with Crow Creek, and sailed on the Missouri to Crescent City. But she is no pacifist. Shapp rode into the Church of Silo, sabotaging a reactor-shrine as a show of force. Her warriors raided to the walls of Brandon, withdrawing only after the king agreed to a 'foreign aid subsidy.' Shappa's victories made her one of the youngest fighters to ever receive the tribe's badge of honour; a sheepskin shirt decorated with beads and the hair scalps of her enemies.  Some of the scalps even dated back to her first raids."
  nf_event_sr.3.a:0 "Remember when she persuaded the Historians to send more teachers?"
  nf_event_sr.3.b:0 "Or she took down that convoy to Missoula?"

  nf_event_sr.4.t:0 "The Treaty of Fort MacArthur"
  nf_event_sr.4.d:0 "[STR.GetLeader] sent a delegate with a most unusual proposal. Our shipments to Chicago have long been harassed traveling through the Dakotas, hindering MacArthur's contribution to National Reconstruction. And there are some valuable minerals in some of the lands they rule. Should we go forward with this agreement? The only real downside will be that the Sioux will become more powerful, but that will just be a problem for the riff raff between us and the heartland. \n\nWe will gain resource rights providing us with metal and water if we agree to this."
  nf_event_sr.4.a:0 "This is an excellent idea!"
  nf_event_sr.4.b:0 "Won't they shoot us next?"

  nf_event_sr.5.t:0 "A Gift from the Last Americans"
  nf_event_sr.5.d:0 "[MCA.GetLeader] agreed to the terms of our proposal. While some regret dealing with the Enclave, this is only temporary. When we've crushed our enemies, we will avenge ourselves in Missoula, after all."
  nf_event_sr.5.a:0 "They should have remembered Custer."

  nf_event_sr.6.t:0 "Custer's Legacy"
  nf_event_sr.6.d:0 "[MCA.GetLeader] refused our proposal, confirming there can be no peace between the US Army and the Lakota. The good news is we'll get many of the resources we need simply by harassing their convoys."
  nf_event_sr.6.a:0 "Good luck getting back to Chicago, Iya."

  nf_event_sr.7.t:0 "The Other Hunters"
  nf_event_sr.7.d:0 "The tribes of Standing Rock invite us to join an alliance, to carve up the North between us.  Under the terms of this proposal, we shall go west, they shall go north, and together we will forge a mighty empire! Shall we pursue this plan?"
  nf_event_sr.7.a:0 "United we stand..."
  nf_event_sr.7.b:0 "Divided they fall."

  nf_event_sr.8.t:0 "Our New Ancient Enemies"
  nf_event_sr.8.d:0 "[KHA.GetLeader] spurned our offer. I suppose we'll just have to massacre them and drive them to a harsh and desolate land. Hah. Imagine how awful that would be!"
  nf_event_sr.8.a:0 "Honestly it would be kind of funny."
  nf_event_sr.8.b_tt: "§R\nThis will give Standing Rock a war goal on you.  Are you really sure you want to do this?  Really, really sure?§!"


  nf_event_sr.9.t:0 "The Destruction of Mount Rushmore"
  nf_event_sr.9.d:0 "The Lakota long quarreled with the federal government over Mount Rushmore's presence on their lands, but after the Great War they had other priorities. Now [STR.GetLeader] has decided to leave her mark on history and destroy the old monument - a reminder to the world that this land is, and always be, her people's. The bombs knocked Lincoln's nose to the floor of the canyon, gouged out Washington's eye, and fractured Germanotti's jaw. Still, much of the mountain remains. A reminder that men come and go, but earth abides. \n\n"But as the earth abids," cries [STR.GetLeader], "so do we. This is, and will always be, our land.""
  nf_event_sr.9.a:0 "I wonder if we can sell the rubble?"
  nf_event_sr.9.b:0 "You've made a powerful enemy today."
  nf_event_sr.9.c:0 "Oh no, an explosion in a prewar ruin. Anyway."

  STR_standing_rock_desc:0 "The Lakota have always been a fighting people ever since our territory was trampled over by tresspassers as they desecrated and ravaged our lands. Brave warchiefs fell in battle fighting against the European conquerers and for many years they put up a valiant effort fighting off these foreign invaders. \n\nHowever the will of our tribe was subdued by greater force and vast exploitation before the §YGreat Flames§! engulfed the Earth caused our tribe to be weak and dying.

  STR_seven_fires_desc:0 "Once our great peoples were united under the culture of our ancestors, the Lakota. But now the campfire stands split and we must re-unite it to once again decide the future fate of our tribes. To find a §YWakan§! we must achieve unity in our council or the peoples of Lakota will never return into the favour of Inyan and honour his fallen body even after the great fires desecrated his plains and rivers."
  STR_warrior_woman:0 "Come the Hour"
  STR_warrior_woman_desc:0 "For centuries our council has lost all hopes of finding someone to revitalize the spirit of our tribe and be the possible §YWakan§! to bring us in to great prosperity. Now our hopes are rekindled in the spirit of a possible holy one, a daring and battle-ready woman from the §3Blackfoot§! to guide the Lakota to a greater future where Inyan's body is ever-green and under our watchful eyes. "
  STR_economic_growth:0 "The Vast Herds of Brahmin"
  STR_economic_growth_desc:0 "Large swaths of wild Brahmin graze the great plains in search of green pastures, leaving a trail of future fertilizer in their wake. If we begin raising fences around their grazing ground we can begin to herd them and begin constructing a new location for some of our shepherds to specialize in ranching and use it as an area to craft material goods."
  STR_salvage_goods:0 "Salvage the Pipeline"
  STR_salvage_goods_desc:0 "The Dakota Access Pipeline was a key sign of the greed that lead the world to its final conclusion in the great fire. A monument to greed and the exploitation of our lands, however it may have ironically been a blessing in disguise. Centuries after its construction it is now a prime source for raw materials, an endless line of future weapons and goods await at the pipeline."
  STR_windmills:0 "Windmill Development"
  STR_windmills_desc:0 "Swaths of giant monoliths to a cleaner future were shown in the plannings of the developments of pre-fire Dakota. Sadly none of them were built and instead they decided to burn our land and cover it with their devilish pollution. Perhaps we can revitalize their idea with our newly found resources and bring a calm and tranquil way of harvesting the winds of the plains."
  STR_vegetable_bounty:0 "The Bounty of the Dakotas"
  STR_vegetable_bounty_desc:0 "If we wish to return these plains to their once great prosperity under the watchful and ever radiant eye of §YThe Great God Wi§!

With enough time and effort we can begin to support our evergrowing tribe."
  STR_housing_expansion:0 "Return to Our Roots"
  STR_housing_expansion_desc:0 "If we wish to return our peoples to being the primary inhabitants of these once exploited and conquered lands we must erect palisades and tents and begin the construction of a new harmonic housing project that cooperates with the land instead of killing it."
  STR_plowshares_to_swords:0 "Plows Into Guns"
  STR_plowshares_to_swords_desc:0 "A lot of our old and outdated farming equipment could be repurposed into raw materials, in exchange for farmers' tools we can offer an array of barter goods and reforge their old and rickety metal to produce weapons of war."
  STR_riches_of_land:0 "Mother Earth's Riches"
  STR_riches_of_land_desc:0 "It's quite obvious why the old-war enemies of ours that exploited our land knew what they were fighting for, riches beyond the imagination lay hiding under our supple and golden grasses. If we revitalize some of the old scars in the flesh of Mother Earth to use for our own purposes we may cause less harm while supplanting ourselves a more secure future in the region."
  STR_nakota_recruits:0 "Nakota Warriors"
  STR_nakota_recruits_desc:0 "If we wish to survive the oncoming tide of chaos and destruction of our lands we must enlist the help of outsiders from the tribe. In the days of old they were called Nakota, our allies, and today they must return into favour so our lands can be safe once more."
  STR_MLA_contract:0 "MLA Trade Agreement"
  STR_MLA_contract_desc:0 "Great green man-beasts from the East approach us with offerings of peace, claiming their tribe has suffered similar exploitation from the outsiders and that they see a potential agreement between our two tribes to secure us both a future worth fighting for. At the moment they wish to trade great weapons of war that would aid our cause, but perhaps in future we can divert them to more peaceful methods."
  STR_farmer_tribute:0 "Farmers' Tribute"
  STR_farmer_tribute_desc:0 "We must ask a great burden of our farmers to further our nation's well-being, a tribute to our tribe to keep us afloat during times of future famine. While we wish not to use force as the §ROld-World demons§! did we can not simply allow those who do not support the tribe to simply ignore us."
  STR_river_league_ports:0 "Treaty Ports for the River League"
  STR_river_league_ports_desc:0 "The River League controls access to the great flowing rapids at our disposal, if we do not use one of their predetermined ports we can not have consistent access to the river without catastrophe.

  STR_never_again:0 "Never Again"
  STR_never_again_desc:0 "If we wish to avoid being overpowered as we must assert our control of the Skies, as they are the home of Wi and Maka. If we repair some of the taboo technology that lays dormant we can fight the demonic sky machines that once descended and slaughtered our people."

  STR_farm_development_desc:0 "With our ever-growing stockpile of Brahmin dung we can start composting it and turning it into decent fertilizer, helping our cycle continue and the land prosper with this beautiful returning of materials to the Mother Earth."
  STR_MCA_offer: "A Deal With the Devil"
  STR_MCA_offer_desc: "Although we laugh at the pretensions of anyone who pretends to be the United States Army, we can't deny the use of their weapons. Just like Inya once had to sacrifice his body to bring peace and life to the earth it is now time we make a similar sacrifice with our enemies of old, perhaps we can arrange a deal with them in exchange for military aid?"

  STR_supplies_for_war:0 "A Well Stocked Larder"
  STR_supplies_for_war_desc:0 "If we begin stocking our supplies for future war then we may be more prepared when it finally arrives. Accumulating a stockpile ensures we don't have to maintain constant production and allows more effiency in how we use our trading camps across the territories."
  STR_summon_council:0 "Summon the Council"
  STR_summon_council_desc:0 "§3We must summon the seven tribes§! and finally begin our destiny. With §YShappa Wagner§! Leading our helm the gods will surely favour us in the future. We must finally elect her to bring a new era to these decadent but traditional tribes."
  STR_cansasa: "Seek Guidance from Spirits"
  STR_cansasa_desc: "To seek wisdom about her next action, [STR.GetLeader] will make an offering of the smoke of the cansasa to the Spirits of the East, North, and South. On this vision quest, she will find a proper target for her people."
  STR_sun_dance: "Perform the Sun Dance"
  STR_sun_dance_desc: "To show her commitment to the people, [STR.GetLeader] will perform the Sun Dance. For four days, she will fast and dance before the sun, offering her body to please her people. May this commitment reflect [STR.GetLeader]'s devotion to Standing Rock.' "

  STR_historians:0 " An Old History for a New World"
  STR_historians_desc:0 "The Historians to our North propagate lies taught from a time of old, they take the word of greedy demon-influenced men as gospel. It is time to end their lies and see what we will do with the remnants of what is left after our raids."

  STR_wade_into_the_missouri_desc:0 "If we begin scouting the southern flank of the Riverside federation then we perhaps can have an advantage on them due to our advanced planning. We will send out our best Eagle scouts and see what they return with."
  STR_historians_for_us:0 "Learned Servants"
  STR_historians_for_us_desc:0 "The Historians claim to be great keepers of secrets of our ancestral past. Perhaps they can greaten our connection with the land by furthering our knowledge of antiquity and our past chieftains. After all they seem like innocent ignorants that simply wish to collect the knowledge they have available to their §3short-sighted childish eyes§!. We will focus their attention on the lessons of our ancestors."
  STR_reclaim_the_birthright: "Reclaim the Birthright"
  STR_reclaim_the_birthright_desc: "The Black Hills of the Dakotas were ours for centuries, and up until recently we ranged across them. The old United States broke the Treaty of Fort Laramie, and took the land they built their idols on. Now in our absence the cultists of Mount Rushmore claim it as their home and sacred land. Let us remedy our misfortune and retake our rivers and mountains!"
  STR_fate_of_mount_rushmore: "The Fate of Six Fathers Mountain"
  STR_fate_of_mount_rushmore_desc: "The Tunkasila Sakpe Paha were sacred to our people. Named for the six sacred directions, the monuments remain an insult to us. Perhaps it is time to definitely remind the North who rules these lands?"
  STR_shut_down_saloons: "Shut Down the Bars"
  STR_shut_down_saloons_desc: "Ekalaka's a bit of a trading hub, tied to the saloons that cater to ranchers and trappers. But alcohol has no place in our domain as it is a man-made concoction simply meant to cloud the mind, not to enlighten it."
  STR_confiscate_ranches: "Confiscate Ranches"
  STR_confiscate_ranches_desc: "Many of the ranches of the Dakotas are prosperous and well maintained. They are fitting rewards for our most loyal warriors, who will also garrison the region for us as veterans of war."
  STR_sin_bismarck: "Sink Bismarck"
  STR_sin_bismarck_desc: "The River League seeks to dominate the North's economy through the port of Bismarck and horde all of its grand wealth. This land is ours, now and forever, not some money-hungry baron's plain!"
  STR_warrior_lodges: "The Warrior Societies"
  STR_warrior_lodges_desc: "The Lakota have a history of clubs and fraternities for warriors each with their own ritual.  The Strong Heart, the Silent Eaters, and the Kit Fox are only some of them. [STR.Getleader] will encourage their role in the tribe's society."
  STR_counting_coup: "Counting Coup"
  STR_counting_coup_desc: "To defeat an enemy in battle is not enough; true honour comes from crushing their prestige. Counting coup means to disarm or humiliate an opponent without killing them, such as hitting them on the head and running away. A reminder that we could have killed a foe and did not consider him worth the effort."
  STR_rifle_carbines: "Master Marksmen"
  STR_rifle_carbines_desc: "Our people were among the first in the West to adopt firearms, and our skill served us well in the winters after the Great War. Let us ensure our warriors always have the finest weapons."
  STR_song_of_dog: "The Victors' Chants"
  STR_song_of_dog_desc: "'I am going to War, I will slay, I will burn, I will bring away slaves, I will eat men.'  Our warriors are not mindless robots like they have down south, but heroes who risk their lives for honour and glory. We will tame our neighbours as we would a dog."
  STR_hunka: "Normalizing Tribute"
  STR_hunka_desc: "You cannot skin a brahmin and then milk it. Let us regularize our tribute demands, discouraging resistance to our rule and perhaps regularizing a constant sacrifice to the Tribe, it will teach the outsiders well."
  STR_motorcycles: "Our Mounted Warriors"
  STR_motorcycles_desc: "Horses have their advantages, to be sure. But there's something to be said for having the resources to drive an off-road motorcycle and crossing the plains in a fraction of the time."
  STR_lightning_raids: "The Sunkawakan"
  STR_lightning_raids_desc: "A horse is not a tool - they are our faithful friends and allies. We guarded them and kept them alive when the Great War almost destroyed the world, and they repay that debt by protecting the tribe."
  STR_holy_dog: "Tasunka"
  STR_holy_dog_desc: "They say there are peoples to the east who have a deep connection to Deathclaws or other creatures of the waste. What makes them so special?  We understand horses like none in the Wasteland can. Let me tell you the story of how we first met . . . "
  STR_bombs_explosive: "Wakinyan Weapons"
  STR_bombs_explosive_desc: "Wakinyan, the Thunder Spirits, have long protected the Lakota. Our warriors honour them by fighting in their image and casting thundery fury from their souls just like our great ancestors did."

  STR_buffalo_trade: "The Bison Trade"
  STR_buffalo_trade_desc: "Bison furs are exported down the Mnisose and south and east, and are in demand across the Wasteland. The fashionable ladies of Chicago, Brotherhood paladins in their pomp, and priest-merchants in their Memphis pyramid are all glad for a bison robe during the winter. We should exploit our control over the trade for further profit."
  STR_building_slots: "Subject Villages"
  STR_building_slots_desc: "Recognizing the rights of ranchers and farmers to live under protection will let our people focus on their priority - war and ruling. Our people will surely understand the period of great strife we find ourselves under."
  STR_confiscate_guns: "Confiscate Materiel"
  STR_confiscate_guns_desc: "The people under our protection have little need for many of their supplies. We are in dire need of more supplies and they must make a sacrifice just like our soldiers do on our home borders."
  STR_mazawakan: "Modern Mazawakan"
  STR_mazawakan_desc: "Mazawakan, or thunder sticks, were the key to our conquest of the plains in the 19th century. We must ensure that we maintain this cutting edge so that our Gods do not forget our ingenuity in the face of evil."
  STR_fur_trade_expansion: "Control of the Fur Trade"
  STR_fur_trade_expansion_desc: "By imposing a uniform set of rules and customs, we ensure that all who acquire pelts and furs in our lands pay us accordingly. How wonderful for our people to be led by [STR.GetLeader]."
  STR_naval_bases: "Control the River"

  STR_port_benefit_trade: "Welcome the Traders"
  STR_port_benefit_trade_desc: "There is nothing wrong with a merchant who respects our prowess. We like coffee, a Pip boy, and tobacco as much as anyone else. Provided they pay their tribute on time, there is no reason traders cannot be welcome in Bismarck."

  STR_masters_of_the_plains: "Masters of the Plains"

  STR_loot_stores: "Loot the Stores"
  STR_loot_stores_desc: "Most unusual. Some of Marshall's weapons are well beyond what we'd expect. Could MacArthur be supporting our foes, what more could we expect from simple profiteers and exploiters that worship the Old World?"
  STR_energy_weapons_slaves: "New Management"
  STR_energy_weapons_slaves_desc: "The workers of Marshall are free to maintain their employment. It is just that they now work for us under a new tribe that does not value gold over life."
  STR_local_auxiliaries: "Local Auxiliaries"
  STR_local_auxiliaries_desc: "The Lakota have never ridden to war alone. We've often had tribes who were ready and willing to fight with us. Why should that trend stop if we are sacrificing our kin for the safety of their lands?"
  STR_settler_support: "Logistical Support"
  STR_settler_support_desc: "Generally, we never needed to carry support for heavier weaponry. But as our foes increase, so must our firepower and thus we must bring greater destruction into a war of never-ending competition to see who can outmatch the evil of the other."
  STR_mechanized_support: "Our Metal Mounts"
  STR_mechanized_support_desc: "Horses have a lot of advantages over vehicles. They don't need fuel; reproduce on their own; and are a good companion in a way that no machine will ever be. But there are still some uses for vehicles on the surviving roads."
  STR_army_bases: "Salvage Army Bases"
  STR_army_bases_desc: "The US Army didn't maintain large facilities in the Dakotas, but in a way that's to our benefit. There hasn't been anyone to salvage them other than us and it is fitting that our once great enemies now lay decrepit and rusting, waiting for us to salvage their corpses."
  STR_sunkas: "The Sunka"

  STR_warior_ways_desc: "Every family has its servants, its horses, and its caps. Our young train for the skill they excel at - war. Instead of grubbing in the dirt, we can make others do it for it; while we raise our herds and control the Plains. How glorious is life!"
  STR_khan_alliances: "An Alliance of Khanvenience"
  STR_khan_alliances_desc: "The Khans are another tribe in the Wasteland, pushed east by the aggressive government of California. Perhaps we can work together?"
  STR_dakotas: "Dominion over the Dakotas"
  STR_dakotas_desc: "All of the Dakotas once paid us tribute. Why should we bleed on our lands and give our bison up without asking something in return for the great peace and prosperity we carry across Mother Earth's land?"
  STR_montanas: "Mastery of Montana"
  STR_montanas_desc: "Montana, too, was once our domain. Who are the Enclave to think it's theirs? What right does the Brotherhood have to our once great lands now tainted by greed and the abuse of technology?"
  STR_manitoba: "Muster for Manitoba"
  STR_manitoba_desc: "The plains of Manitoba should fall to us as well. Why not? We roamed there once, and could use a buffer against those who carry a red banner claiming to want to share their prosperity equally while oppressing and waging war and funding a despot leader."
  STR_reopen_mines: "Mine for Metal"
  STR_reopen_mines_desc: "We have plenty of subjects who will gladly dig in the dirt for riches. Why not let them try and see what metals we can extract from the great underground that our ancestors lay claim to?"
  STR_timber_lake: "Drink Deep From Timber Lake"
  STR_timber_lake_desc: "Timber Lake is at the heart of our territory, but the land itself is little populated and is filled with evergreen trees and bountiful crops.  What better place to satiate the thirst of our mounts and riders?"
  STR_destroy_mount_rushmore:0 "Destroy Mount Rushmore"
  STR_destroy_mount_rushmore_desc:0 "We were never founds of that old ruin. Now that it's under control, perhaps it's time to settle the debate over it once and for all. This will cement [STR.GetLeader] as the chief of Standing Rock and a role in our people's annals."
  STR_circuitry_salvage:0 "Salvage Circuitry"
  STR_circuitry_salvage_desc:0 "The Northern Commonwealth was never an industrial or technological hub. Our riches were our people, our families, and our vast natural resources. But that meant that more survived the Great War than you might expect."
  STR_fuel_refineries:0 "Coal for the Cold"
  STR_fuel_refineries_desc: "Obviously we will not mine the coal ourselves, but there is great wealth in the land. While the land may become dirtier as a result why shouldn't we profit from the gifts our Great God's body bestowed upon us when he made his sacrifice?"
  MCA_loot:0 "MacArthur's Plunder"
  MCA_loot_desc:0 "The Enclave claims it shall return just as the Lakota returned. We will see. In the interim, the weapons we rightfully took as loot from MacArthur will give us victory in any further conflict with the vermin of the earth."
  STR_naval_bases_2:0 "Journey Down the River"
  STR_naval_bases_2_desc:0 "Now that we have unquestioned access to the Riverside we can begin constructing our own ports to house our canoes and warships for future incursions."
