  itz_ruling_the_waves_desc:0 "The islands of the Caribbean are numerous, and the islands themselves are fertile and defensible. It is, therefore, of the upmost importance that we have the strongest navy around so that we may seize and safeguard the wealth for ourselves."

  itz_cometh_the_hour_cometh_the_man_desc:0 "The day was dark - the Aztecs were on the advance, and the bulk Ejército were in broken retreat from the Aztec forces. However, a young and charismatic general emerged and rallied the few troops he could into battle once more. Through a combination of surprise, brilliant tactical decisions and sheer desperation, the Ejército troops shattered the Aztec vanguard."
  itz_expand_the_factories:0 "Expand the Factories"

  itz_the_kalomtes_adventures_desc:0 "Under Kalomte Sebastián, the Itzan Empire has drastically expanded in size. In most of campaigns under the Kalomte’s leadership, the Kalomte has led the Itzan forces himself. He has no intention of giving this up."
  itz_enlarge_the_forces:0 "Enlarge the Forces"
  itz_enlarge_the_forces_desc:0 "We have many thousands of men under our command, but our borders stretches for many thousands of metres, and is expanding with each new conquest. New regiments are required to fight on the front, and to protect the heartland!"
  itz_encourage_civilian_commerce:0 "Encourage Civilian Commerce"
  itz_encourage_civilian_commerce_desc:0 "A strong coastal trade makes our Empire powerful. By encouraging civilians to trade goods and set up their own businesses, we can ensure goods are widely available around the empire, assisting future construction and trade."
  itz_peninsula_roads:0 "Peninsula Roads"
  itz_peninsula_roads_desc:0 "When it comes to coastal travel, boats are the best call. However, naval travel is dangerous and unpredictable. To counter this, we should expand on roads connecting coastal settlements, allowing coastal communities to safely trade."
  itz_southwards_expansion:0 "Southwards Expansion"
  itz_southwards_expansion_desc:0 "With the war claiming more and more of our land as well as our people, it would do us well to find solace in new allies. To the south lies the nation of Honduras, led by Comandante Luis, and guarding our southern frontier. With some coercion and help, they might be willing to join our cause. We should prioritize our diplomatic efforts with them at once!"
  itz_enlarge_the_raiding_parties:0 "Enlarge the Raiding Parties"
  itz_enlarge_the_raiding_parties_desc:0 "Our naval operations allow us to raid settlements up and down the Gulf Coast, and into the Caribbean, for their riches. This method had allowed our capital, the Chichen Itza, to drastically grow in population and decadence. Surely more men dedicated to this duty can’t have a downside."
  itz_navigate_the_gulf:0 "Map the Gulf"
  itz_navigate_the_gulf_desc:0 "The Itza rule the waves of the Mexican stretch of the Gulf of Mexico, as well as in a sizable chunk of the Caribbean. By navigating and mapping the remainder of the Gulf, we should be able to expand our naval power across the entire region!"
  itz_naval_reform:0 "Naval Reform"
  itz_naval_reform_desc:0 "At the moment, our navy is heavily decentralised, focused around small raiding parties and a larger main fleet. We should strive to integrate the fleets together around a central command structure, to allow strategic control of the Gulf."
  itz_regiment_the_ejercito:0 "Regiment the Ejército"
  itz_regiment_the_ejercito_desc:0 "The Ejército are our elite forces. They consist of recruits from urban areas, and are regularly drilled and are well equipped. However, the size of each group varies according to volunteer willingness and local populations. We should strive to standardise the Ejército entirely – creating a few new divisions in the process."
  itz_dockside_trade:0 "Dockside Trade"
  itz_dockside_trade_desc:0 "Our control of the seas means that our coastal trade flourishes. Our citizens are more than happy taking to the seas to trade goods, and so markets thrive on the docks as boats bring in goods from up and down the Empire."
  itz_peninsula_factories:0 "Peninsula Factories"
  itz_peninsula_factories_desc:0 "Placing new factories in our heartland is a great boon. They will be able to produce munitions for our armies even if the worst shall come and we lose most of our Empire – though that day will never come."
  itz_strike_the_raiders:0 "Support the Southern Front"
  itz_strike_the_raiders_desc:0 "Sending massive amount of guns and ammunition to the southern Guerreros will increase their opinion of us. The fact they might then join our war is, of course, a pure coincidence. And if that would make them willing to give us some territorial claim, then what's the harm?"

  itz_cultural_ties_with_tzotzil_desc:0 "In the early days of the fallout, when our nation was just getting to its feet, a small group of the early Itzan citizens, dissatisfied with the first Kalomte, split from our nation. They travelled south, through the jungle, eventually establishing themselves in deep in the jungle, forging [TDT.GetName] in the process. As a result, we share many cultural links with Tzotzil, which are practically begging to be exploited."
  itz_a_new_foe:0 "A New Foe"
  itz_a_new_foe_desc:0 "Up in the north, past our borderlands, something is afoot. Industry is churning, and resources are being stripped from the landscape. Who, or what, is doing this we do not know – but we must find out."
  itz_island_hopping:0 "Island Hopping"
  itz_island_hopping_desc:0 "The islands of the Caribbean are placed closely together, allowing us to easily invade one island from the last."

  itz_the_grand_gulf_fleet_desc:0 "Whilst the Itzan fleet may rule the waves of the southern Gulf, we do not know enough about the other naval powers of the continent to be able to confidently declare victory. Our fleet must be invincible!"
  itz_new_designs:0 "New Designs"
  itz_new_designs_desc:0 "Refitting pre-war craft and manufacturing simple sea-going craft has been enough to secure naval dominance for now, but we can’t rely on these methods forever. We must create new, innovative designs to ensure we continue to rule the waves."
  itz_expand_the_merodeadores:0 "Expand the Merodeadores"
  itz_expand_the_merodeadores_desc:0 "The Merodeadores are small marine units under separate command from the rest of the army. This makes them perfect for small-scale invasions over rivers or seas, and so should be expanded upon!"

  itz_the_challenge_for_leadership_desc:0 "After years of carful political marriages and clever resources investments, we have managed to elevate a loyalist to a senior position in Tzotzil. All he needs to do now is successfully challenge Tzotzil’s leader to a duel, and Tzotzil will be a loyal puppet!"
  itz_technology_raids:0 "Technology Raids"
  itz_technology_raids_desc:0 "The lands to the north are full of two things – hostile armies and technological riches. Using our tried and tested naval raiding techniques, as well as some central planning, we should be able to effectively ‘liberate’ some of this technology, and bring it back home for our own use."
  itz_bases_here:0 "Bases here..."
  itz_bases_here_desc:0 "To extend our naval dominance in the Caribbean, we need a network of naval bases across the area. These must be secured, one way or the other…"
  itz_promote_admiral_perez:0 "Promote Almirante Perez"
  itz_promote_admiral_perez_desc:0 "Perez, an officer in command of one of our raiding fleets, has done much to reform his group into a fearsome naval force. He should be invited to help reform the whole navy in the same model!"
  itz_begin_integration:0 "Adapt to New Ideas"
  itz_begin_integration_desc:0 "The founders of [TDT.GetNameDef] left the Itza thanks to ideological divisions with our High Priests. Since then, much has changed, and our society has become much more amenable to new ideas. By embracing the reformist ideas being espoused in Tzotzil, we may be able to reform society for the better!"
  itz_clashes_with_the_aztecs:0 "Clashes with the Aztlan"
  itz_clashes_with_the_aztecs_desc:0 "Since our first encounters with the Aztlan, we have been sparring with them on the border. The process has become something of a ritual – each side throws men at the other until forced to back down by sheer losses. Maybe this time we’ll have a breakthrough."
  itz_and_colonies_there:0 "...and colonies there."
  itz_and_colonies_there_desc:0 "Whilst naval bases are all well and good, to exploit the riches of the Caribbean for years to come we must ensure continual access to the local resources."

  itz_rapid_decline_of_society:0 "Rapid Decline of Society"
  itz_rapid_decline_of_society_desc:0 "Without our great Kalomte, things are falling apart. Factions are emerging in the government, leading to departments not working with each other as they should. As a result, the social contract we hold with our citizen – protection for food – is beginning to fall apart, and so society as we knew it is too."
  itz_the_game_is_on:0 "The Game is On"
  itz_the_game_is_on_desc:0 "With the Kalomte’s illness stretching on for weeks now, it has become clear a successor is needed. Two hopefuls outshine the rest – the Ti’huun Clara, and the Ejército’s commander Carlos. Only one can grasp the reigns of the country. The game is on!"
  itz_schemes_and_stability:0 "Schemes and Stability"
  itz_schemes_and_stability_desc:0 "Clara has gained her support on the promise of stability. Once the empire is restored, she promises a focus on the economy and improving living standards, rather than fighting futile wars for little gain. Based on these promises, and a healthy dose of webweaving, she has secured control of the country."
  itz_the_impossible_possible:0 "The Impossible Possible"
  itz_the_impossible_possible_desc:0 "The greatest miracle of the modern age has occurred. The Kalomte is healed! At this rate, it seems he will be able to resume his control of the country within weeks, and his command in the field not long after. Oh, joyous day!"
  itz_guns_and_glory:0 "Guns and Glory"
  itz_guns_and_glory_desc:0 "Carlos made no attempts to hide his agenda. He campaigned on rampant militarism and a drastic expansion of the Empire. His support amongst the Ejército has also undoubtably helped him secure victory in the power struggle."
  itz_expand_the_tihuuns_bodyguard:0 "Expand the Ti'huun's Bodyguard"
  itz_expand_the_tihuuns_bodyguard_desc:0 "Clara may be in control of the country, but her rule is far from secure. By expanding her bodyguard, a fiercely loyal group of elite troops, more and more of the country can be secured."
  itz_deal_with_the_ejercito:0 "Deal with the Ejército"
  itz_deal_with_the_ejercito_desc:0 "The Ejército is a troublesome group. They are our elite land troops, relied on heavily for the defence of our borderlands, but are also fiercely loyal to their leadership – with Carlos at the top. They must be made subservient to us again, one way or the other!"
  itz_the_kalomte_rules_again:0 "The Kalomte Rules Again"
  itz_the_kalomte_rules_again_desc:0 "Whilst news of the Kalomte’s recovery put an effective end to the power struggle, he has yet to return properly to his throne and once again take command of matters of the nation."
  itz_deal_with_the_tihuun:0 "Deal with the Ti'huun"
  itz_deal_with_the_tihuun_desc:0 "Throughout the power struggle, the Ti’huun has been nothing but a nuisance. Her delicate plotting seems to be without end, even now, and as a result she must be dealt with."
  itz_establish_military_rule:0 "Establish Military Rule"
  itz_establish_military_rule_desc:0 "The civilian government is rife with Clara’s loyalists, and can’t be trusted. The only viable option is the military taking direct control."

  itz_build_the_grand_palace_desc:0 "There’s no better way to show off your power than building a grand palace!"
  itz_reduce_the_ejercito_to_border_patrol:0 "Reduce the Ejército to Border Patrol"
  itz_reduce_the_ejercito_to_border_patrol_desc:0 "The Ejército have repeatedly shown profuse disloyalty, and so we must take a severe stance against them. The Ejército should be stripped of its power in its entirety, and relegated to a state of exile in the borderlands."
  itz_purge_the_ambitious_officers:0 "Purge the Ambitious Officers"
  itz_purge_the_ambitious_officers_desc:0 "The Ejército have repeatedly shown profuse disloyalty, but this is only due to their strong sense of discipline – a commendable feature. If we replace those the Ejército answer to with loyalists, they will surely follow."
  itz_reshuffle_the_political_landscape:0 "Reshuffle the Political Landscape"
  itz_reshuffle_the_political_landscape_desc:0 "The old political situation has grown stagnant, and as we have seen just a short while ago, prone to power struggles. A drastic shakeup is needed!"
  itz_establish_the_royal_guard:0 "Establish the Royal Guard"
  itz_establish_the_royal_guard_desc:0 "The Kalomte’s injury was grave, and due to a rouge agitator in the northern borderlands slipping past the Kalomte’s bodyguard. We should expand and formalise this bodyguard to ensure it never happens again!"
  itz_merodeadores_as_marines:0 "Merodeadores as Marines"
  itz_merodeadores_as_marines_desc:0 "The Merodeadores had, before the power struggle, been become more and more active in our land theatres. However, their loyalty to Clara in the struggle has meant that they can no longer be trusted to defend our country. They must be consolidated and restricted to dealing with our naval affairs."
  itz_scrap_the_merodeadores:0 "Scrap the Merodeadores"
  itz_scrap_the_merodeadores_desc:0 "The Merodeadores were loyal to Clara, and for that there can be no defence. They must be scrapped in their entirety!"
  itz_place_all_ejercito_factories:0 "All Military Factories Under the Ejército"
  itz_place_all_ejercito_factories_desc:0 "Previously, our military industry has been in a rather confused state, split between some state-owned and some Ejército-owned factories. To simplify this process, we should place all our factories under Ejército control, as they know best when it comes to the military!"
  itz_the_last_purge:0 "The Last Purge"
  itz_the_last_purge_desc:0 "Following Clara’s rise to power, she has led a series of purges of various factions in the bureaucracy and army to ensure her power is absolute. The purges are almost ending, but one remains…"
  itz_a_popular_populist_monarch:0 "A Popular, Populist Monarch"
  itz_a_popular_populist_monarch_desc:0 "Clara has two things going for her – her popularity, and her populism. Her charisma has earnt her a place in the hearts, and loyalties, of the people, and her populist promises of stability have ensured her the support of the aristocracy and political elite."
  itz_death_or_glory:0 "Death or Glory?"
  itz_death_or_glory_desc:0 "The generals of the Ejército have been nothing but trouble. However, if we purge them, we leave a gaping hole in our command structure – but if we don’t, we risk a coup."
  itz_solidify_succession:0 "Solidify Succession"
  itz_solidify_succession_desc:0 "The reason for our last power struggle was that there was no clear successor to the Kalomte. This should be rectified."
  itz_enforcing_the_cult_of_personality:0 "Enforcing the Cult of Personality"
  itz_enforcing_the_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "The Kalomte has always had an avid cult of personality, thanks to his victories abroad and reforms at home. We should enforce this cult of personality, ensuring all our people realise how great a leader he is!"
  itz_resume_military_duties:0 "Resume Military Duties"
  itz_resume_military_duties_desc:0 "The time has come! The Kalomte is finally well enough to re-join his troops. They have certainly missed his military prowess."
  itz_the_schemers_longevity:0 "The Schemer's Longevity"
  itz_the_schemers_longevity_desc:0 "The schemer, Clara, has been under house arrest for some time, but no decision has been made about her longevity. It can certainly be said she’s a masterful bureaucrat, but she’s also proved to be a master schemer."
  itz_ramp_up_militarism:0 "Ramp Up Militarism"
  itz_ramp_up_militarism_desc:0 "One of the problems facing our nation is that farmers in the fields feel distanced from the wars we wage at the front. We should ramp up militarist sentiment."
  itz_defence_of_the_homeland:0 "Defence of the Homeland"
  itz_defence_of_the_homeland_desc:0 "Now, for the first time since the Kalomte’s ascendance to power, the homeland is under direct threat of invasion. It must be defended – at any cost."
  itz_industrial_modernisation:0 "Industrial Modernisation"
  itz_industrial_modernisation_desc:0 "Our industry is largely bespoke solutions to local problems, and consists of techniques that have been used for hundreds of years. We must change this, and bring ourselves into a modern, post-fallout world."
  itz_expand_the_status_quo:0 "Expand the Status Quo"
  itz_expand_the_status_quo_desc:0 "The economic system employed by us before the Kalomte’s injury worked well enough. There’s no need for drastic reform, or drastic expansion."
  itz_total_mobilisation:0 "Total Mobilisation"
  itz_total_mobilisation_desc:0 "There will never be a day in which the Itza is not under threat of invasion by evil foreign empires. Our economy must be geared around war, war and nothing but war at all times!"
  itz_drastic_military_restructuring:0 "Drastic Military Restructuring"
  itz_drastic_military_restructuring_desc:0 "All aspects of the armed forces have been disloyal in one way or the other, and the only way to rectify this is to reform the service from the ground up, no matter the chaos it might cause."
  itz_changing_roles_around:0 "Changing Roles Around"
  itz_changing_roles_around_desc:0 "Certain elements of the armed forces have been profusely disloyal and in need of a shakeup. The basic structure of the forces, however, does not need much change."
  itz_shaky_status_quo:0 "Shaky Status Quo"
  itz_shaky_status_quo_desc:0 "For the most part, the armed forces work as they are. Some shakeups are needed, but only in a minor capacity."
  itz_open_up_to_the_world:0 "Open Up to the World"
  itz_open_up_to_the_world_desc:0 "One of our economic problems has been our refusal to trade with foreign countries, and only relying on our own resources. Whilst this was not so much of a problem in our early stages, now that our industry is expanding it needs ever more resources to fuel it."
  itz_develop_power_stations:0 "Develop Power Stations"
  itz_develop_power_stations_desc:0 "Power is the lifeblood of our nation. It both drives our machines and pacifies our people. We should expand our distribution stations around the country."
  itz_civilian_construction_brigades:0 "Civilian Construction Brigades"
  itz_civilian_construction_brigades_desc:0 "We both lack industrial capacity and have a large urban unemployment problem. We can kill both these birds with one stone by simply drafting unemployed citizens to construct various things for us."
  itz_empower_the_secret_police:0 "Empower the Secret Police"
  itz_empower_the_secret_police_desc:0 "The Itzan Citizen's Defence Bureau has long ensured that the populace is placated and under our control. We should expand their reach into the aristocracy and factories, to ensure there is no opposition to our rule."
  itz_support_the_merodeadores:0 "Support the Merodeadores"
  itz_support_the_merodeadores_desc:0 "The Merodeadores are a great asset. They are skilled, disciplined and versatile, being the masters of the sea and the land. They supported us through the power struggle, and their loyalty will be well rewarded."
  itz_reform_the_merodeadores:0 "Reform the Merodeadores"
  itz_reform_the_merodeadores_desc:0 "Whilst the Merodeadores isn’t perfect, it’s state does not warrant it total dissolution. Instead, with some careful reform and loyalists in key positions, it can be moulded into a formidable marine force."
  itz_the_destruction_of_the_merodeadores:0 "The Destruction of the Merodeadores"
  itz_the_destruction_of_the_merodeadores_desc:0 "The Merodeadores are truly partisan and obsolete. The only possible solution is to dissolve the Merodeadores in their entirety, and build a new marine corps from the ground up."

  itz_expel_the_ejercito_to_the_borders_desc:0 "Whilst the decision to reduce the Ejército to border control was made soon after the end of the power struggle, it has yet to be implemented. Now is the time to do it, and finally secure our regime against a possible coup."
  itz_recast_the_ejercito:0 "Recast the Ejército"
  itz_recast_the_ejercito_desc:0 "For quite some time, the Ejercito has been a disconcertingly political and insubordinate group. Considering the political strife that has hit Itza in recent years, it has become clear that the partisan elements of the Ejercito must be pressured out and replaced. In removing the traitorous elements of the army, we can finally refine and advance our doctrine, unimpeded by those who stood to gain from the previous arrangement."
  itz_support_the_ejercito:0 "Support the Ejército"
  itz_support_the_ejercito_desc:0 "Contrary to what those in power have at times thought, there is an eminent value to the corrupt and politicized Ejercito. For consolidating our power, there is nothing better than an autonomous, self-sufficient military aligned directly with our party and goals. What’s more, having the right people in power will greatly oil the gears of our war machine when it comes time to act contrary to what seems good and righteous."
  itz_expand_military_production:0 "Expand Military Production"
  itz_expand_military_production_desc:0 "The advent of free trade has proven a boon to the success of our economy. Resources are now beginning to flow freely between Itza and its partners, and these new resources will find good use within our military industrial complex. Militarized workshops dedicated to the state must be constructed and used to create new war material, supported by our growing economy."
  itz_distribution_networks:0 "Distribution Networks"
  itz_distribution_networks_desc:0 "In casting off our yoke of isolationism, we have tested the nation’s infrastructure and found it lacking. If we wish to prove ourselves as valuable trade partners, we must first ensure a reliable flow of goods and materials between our major industrial centres. An expansion of our existing roads and the construction of new ones is in order."
  itz_scavenging_the_wilderness:0 "Scavenging the Wilderness"
  itz_scavenging_the_wilderness_desc:0 "Many generations have passed since the American occupation of Mexico, but the remnants of the US army’s presence are still evident to this day. Abandoned equipment, vehicles and settlements have always been landmarks for our people, but have the capability to be much more. Though much of what was left behind has fallen into disrepair, there is no shortage of old world components to be found, both advanced and simple."
  itz_repair_main_roads:0 "Repair Main Roads"
  itz_repair_main_roads_desc:0 "Though our population is relatively well dispersed throughout the various provinces of our nation, some areas are more well developed than others. Before we are to consider expansion of any kind, we must first dedicate time and resources toward the goal of a system of roads which connect all provinces. Many major highways and footpaths have fallen into disrepair, and must be developed to meet this goal."
  itz_convert_civilian_factories:0 "Convert Civilian Factories"
  itz_convert_civilian_factories_desc:0 "We cannot hope to transform Itza into some sort of utopia whilst its enemies still stand breathing. The nation is more than comfortably developed, and it can be assumed that the majority of our domestic industry is focused on frivolous, unhelpful things. Commandeering workspaces and laborers for production of weapons is the first step in bolstering the industrial end of our military."
  itz_drastically_increase_output:0 "Drastically Increase Output"
  itz_drastically_increase_output_desc:0 "The slack found in our military industrial complex is something which we cannot allow to continue. We must more efficiently work the populace, and give them better facilities with which to produce arms. The ad-hoc construction of new military factories will allow us to better meet quotas and equip our military."
  itz_mass_conscription_for_the_merodeadores:0 "Mass Conscription for the Merodeadores"
  itz_mass_conscription_for_the_merodeadores_desc:0 "For an army to succeed, it must be able to adequately hold a line and occupy land. While the Merodeadores are an elite and powerful group, they often come up lacking in their numbers. By getting new men out and into the field and reorganizing the composition of our marine forces, we can ensure a sturdy line and an adequately-sized fighting force."
  itz_enforce_discipline:0 "Enforce Discipline"
  itz_enforce_discipline_desc:0 "The Merodeadores are a cut above the masses of our army, and serve as skilled and tactical shock troops both in the field and at sea. Despite this, they reflect the state of our military, being rowdy and insubordinate at times. If we are to go forward, we must instil a greater sense of loyalty and unit cohesion in the forces."
  itz_create_the_imc:0 "Create the I.M.C."
  itz_create_the_imc_desc:0 "The Merodeadores are gone, and the gap they’ve left in the structure of our army is one that can be felt and seen clearly. As a coastal nation, we must always integrate the sea into our land operations, and so a new marine corps must be quickly assembled. In addition to forming a modern force of marine soldiers, we must also better incorporate them into the structure of the larger army."
  itz_break_the_ejercitos_hold_on_military_production:0 "Break the Ejército’s Hold on Military Production"
  itz_break_the_ejercitos_hold_on_military_production_desc:0 "For quite some time now, the control of our military industry has fallen to the Ejercito. With tensions so high, we cannot allow an autonomous and possibly traitorous force to have such a control on our military. Though it may cause strife for some time, the factories must be seized from the Ejercito and returned to control of the state."
  itz_destroy_officer_careerism:0 "Destroy Officer Careerism"
  itz_destroy_officer_careerism_desc:0 "Though it may not be as corrupt and double-dealing as it once was, the leadership of the army is still bloated and inefficient. This can be mainly attributed to the fact that the position of military leader has become a chiefly political one, rife with power plays and nepotism. If we can remove these career leaders from control and put power back into the hands of experienced military minds, our army will benefit greatly."
  itz_expand_the_ejercitos_industrial_complexes:0 "Expand the Ejército's Industrial Complexes"
  itz_expand_the_ejercitos_industrial_complexes_desc:0 "If the Ejercito are to become the government implement we wish for them to be, we must ensure the efficiency of our military industrial complex. We may very quickly become bogged down by disloyal elements and unable to equip our army if control of the factories is in the hands of anyone other than the Ejercito. Construction of new state-controlled factories will better centralize our industrial might."

An appropriate investment of funds and minds shall serve this task going forward."
  itz_promote_large_families:0 "Promote Large Families"
  itz_promote_large_families_desc:0 "In order to continue our project of steady expansion, we must ensure a similarly steady expansion in the population of our nation. In addition to a growth in fighting-age men for our armies, a baby boom would also serve as a major help to our growing domestic industry. Civilians are not without their uses, and an increase in workers would naturally allow for the expansion of construction."
  itz_civilian_production:0 "Civilian Production"
  itz_civilian_production_desc:0 "As our scavenging operations grow, and our settlements grow ever more connected, the use of civilian labour must be thoroughly considered.

  itz_examine_the_new_threat_desc:0 "We’ve never faced an enemy like this before. To say we are in any way prepared is a bold-faced lie which could be exposed in a matter of months. Though we may end up fighting in the dark, facing surprise after surprise, we must be as well prepared for this war as possible. Advancing our military strategy is in order."

  itz_adapt_our_tactics_desc:0 "Using our intelligence as best as we can, we must analyse this synthetic threat to the fullest, and attempt to understand its weaknesses. Finding the gap in the AI’s military may be the difference between success and failure, not only strengthening our army’s ability to fight, but our resolve to see this war through as well."

  itz_recreate_technology_desc:0 "Reverse engineering is a destructive technique, and one our nation is ill-equipped to handle. All the same, though, there is no lack of robotic materiel to study and understand. If we can advance to the level of our rivals, we can not only fight the arms race on their turf, but use this technology in our future endeavours as well."

The synthetic threat we face is unerring and easily replaced, and to begin, we can’t expect to hold our line. Fortifying deeper inland and preparing for a defensive war will be key."

We must consider the possibility that we will be fought all the way back to Chichen Itza itself, and ensure that we can continue supplying and equipping our army in the face of such dire odds."

As with our factories, we need to centralize our resource production in the capital itself, preparing for the grim eventuality of losing vast swaths of land."

We must pour all we have into this war, or face extinction. We must rally our people, gather our weapons and prepare to counterattack. If all goes well, we may prevail."

Mesoamerica is ours, and all our historic rivals and enemies are no longer there to stop us. We are empowered, driven, and now it is time to use our momentum and ensure the Itzan empire is immortalized in history forever!"
