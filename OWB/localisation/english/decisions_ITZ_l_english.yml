 # Decisions
  itz_integrating_countdown:0 "Integration Progress"
  itz_integrating_countdown_desc:0 "When the timer is complete, we will integrate [TDT.GetName]."
  itz_pet_border_clash:0 "Skirmish for Steel City"
  itz_pet_border_clash_desc:0 "Forwards - to the coast!"
  itz_harvest_2275_timer:0 "Countdown to the Day of Q'an"
  itz_harvest_2275_timer_desc:0 "Another year in the fields is gradually drawing to a close, and soon it will be time to bring in the crops. Let us hope we reap a good crop!"
  itz_harvest_timer:0 "Countdown to the Day of Q'an"
  itz_harvest_timer_desc:0 "Another year in the fields is gradually drawing to a close, and soon it will be time to bring in the crops. Let us hope we reap a good crop!"
  itz_increase_exemptions:0 "Increase Rural Exemptions"
  itz_increase_exemptions_desc:0 "The best way to ensure a good day of Q'an is to have more men tending to the fields. We should expand rural exemptions to do just that, and ensure famine never stalks this land."
  itz_reduce_exemptions:0 "Reduce Rural Exemptions"
  itz_reduce_exemptions_desc:0 "The chance of famine is insignificant if our farms and towns have been put to the torch by an enemy. More men are needed in the army!"
  itz_ritualistic_sacrifice:0 "Offer a Sacrifice to Hun-Nal-Ye"

 # Power Struggle Decisions
  itz_power_struggle_timer:0 "Countdown to the Council of the Elders"
  itz_power_struggle_timer_desc:0 "Following the Kalomte's injury, the Council of the Elders has been convened to determine who his regent and successor should be. We must do everything we can to ensure we are selected as this candidate!"
  itz_call_early_vote:0 "Demand an Early Vote"
  itz_call_early_vote_desc:0 "If it has become clear that we are the dominant candidate in the race to replace the Kalomte, we can use our influence to convene the Council of the Elders at an earlier date, ensuring our victory early on."
  itz_raid_ejerico_congress:0 "Raid the Ejército's Headquaters"
  itz_raid_ejerico_congress_desc:0 "From time to time, the country is struck by marauding bands of raiders or criminals. It is, therefore, plausible that one such band is emboldened by the power void left after the Kalomte's injury and launches a raid on the Ejército's complex, is it not?"
  itz_clara_appear_with_kalomte:0 "Appear with the Kalomte"
  itz_clara_appear_with_kalomte_desc:0 "Clara does not struggle for support within the mechanisms of the state. After all, Clara has been appointing loyalists to key positions for years. However, Clara struggles for legitimacy in the eyes of the public, and a great way to improve this would be to emphasise a connection between Clara and the wounded Kalomte."
  itz_clara_try_to_treat_kalomte:0 "Attempt to Treat the Kalomte"
  itz_clara_try_to_treat_kalomte_desc:0 "Another solution to Clara's legitimacy problem is to attempt to treat the Kalomte. Whilst unlikely to succeed, it will give the appearance to the public that Clara is not after power, unlike the power-crazed Carlos."
  itz_clara_beef_up_merodeadores:0 "Beef Up the Merodeadores"
  itz_clara_beef_up_merodeadores_desc:0 "Whilst her power base is the state, Clara's time in the Merodeadores and subsequent beneficial policies towards the body have meant that Clara can rely on the Merodeadores in times of need. Expanding their size, therefore, can have no downsides!"
  itz_ej_raid_merodeadores_complexes:0 "Raid the Merodeadores's Headquaters"
  itz_ej_raid_merodeadores_complexes_desc:0 "Whilst Carlos can command the support of the Ejército and the Wach, Clara maintains control over the elite Merodeadores. Whilst too small in number to pose a threat in a civil war, they are numerous enough to prevent any coup attempts, and even launch raids against our complexes. We should, therefore, launch a pre-emptive raid against their leadership complex, under the pretext of national security."
  itz_ej_hold_parade:0 "Hold a Military Parade"
  itz_ej_hold_parade_desc:0 "Nothing inspires pride and loyalty amongst the populace like a good military parade. Let's put one on, and impress the Elders with its might!"
  itz_ej_encourgae_conscripts:0 "Encourage Conscrits"
  itz_ej_encourgae_conscripts_desc:0 "Our main body of support is the Ejército. Therefore, encouraging conscription into the Ejército makes sense, especially if we alter our training programs to include a touch more indoctrination!"
  itz_ej_mil_to_civ_fac:0 "Produce Consumer Goods"
  itz_ej_mil_to_civ_fac_desc:0 "Through years of tactical expansion, the Ejército owns a large armount of military factories directly. If we were to divert some of these factories into production of civilian goods, the people would look favourable on us."

 # Decision Categories
  itz_power_struggle:0 "The Great Game"
  itz_power_struggle_desc:0 "The 'Great Game' is on, and power is in the air! A Council of the Elders has been called by the Ti'huun Clara - and the top item on the agenda is the succession of the Kalomte. It is highly anticipated that the Ti'huun herself will win the struggle, but the Ejército recognise that this will mean the end of their organisation as they know it - and will do everything they can to prevent this outcome. \n\nThe mood of the Elders is represented by §RParty Popularity§!. The faction with the largest influence when the Council meets will be designated as Regent and Heir-Apparent.\n\nINFLUENCE:                      Clara:   [?party_popularity@intellectuals|%G0]                   |                      Carlos:   [?party_popularity@elites|%R0]"
  itz_integrating_tdt:0 "Integrating [TDT.GetName]"
  itz_pet_border_clash_cat:0 "Chaos Down South"
  itz_pet_border_clash_cat_desc:0 "The Itza are in chaos following the critical injury of their Kalomte. Now is the time to sweep in and grab our prize - Steel City. Their troops will melt like butter before our forces."
  itz_harvest:0 "Q'an"
  itz_harvest_desc:0 "The Itzan Empire is vast. We govern over close to a million people, small by pre-war standards, but huge in this post-apocalyptic world. As a result, our farmers must toil hard in their fields to feed the cities and the army. If there is too few of them, or if mother nature just so wishes, we may face a devastating famine – and even §Rsevere civil unrest§!.\n\nThe success of our day of Q'an depends how expansive our rural draft exemptions are, as well the year's day of Q'an predictions, coming from our priests, and ultimately on the Maize Goddess Hun-Nal-Ye herself.\n\nCurrently, our priests predict next year's day of Q'an will be [ROOT.itz_harvest_forecast]."
