  MRR_JACK_REED_NAME:0 "Jack Reed"
  MRR_JACK_REED_DESC:0 "Those in the Marshall Republic are well suited to taking care of themselves, having passed down through the years a willingness to fight for their own and a keen understanding of both living off the land and scavenging what they need. That individualistic nature makes leading them an experience not unlike herding belligerent bighorners however. Such leadership is its own skill set, one that Jack Reed is doing his best to master as threats both from inside and outside the Republic threaten it."
