  nf_mdt.1.t:0 "Life as a Viper"
  nf_mdt.1.d:0 "While now the memory is foggy I am fairly sure that at one point I was a member of the \"Vipers\", a group of criminals from down south. I don't remember a lot from my time there - not even the name I used to use. What lessons, if any did I take from my time there?"
  nf_mdt.1.a:0 "Never give in"
  nf_mdt.1.b:0 "Wealth is power"
  nf_mdt.1.c:0 "Keep your friends close"
  nf_mdt.2.t:0 "The Void"
  nf_mdt.2.d:0 "Eventually, what I am \"fairly sure\" led me here, and what led to me eventually discovering the truth was a job I took up while playing the role of this \"Viper\". I had brought tools and equipment up north, yet one day these same slaves broke out of their chains and used these tools on me. I don't remember their faces, but I still have some scars from when they beat me."
  nf_mdt.2.a:0 "Scars on the face"

  nf_mdt.2.c:0 "Scars on the mind"
  nf_mdt.3.t:0 "The Truth"
  nf_mdt.3.d:0 "After my false life was taken from me -.. that is when I discovered what the world had been hiding from me all of this time. My true place in the world! Weak and weary, I found it after collapsing in the wreckage of a old building.\n\"Hubris Comics Grognak the Barbarian, In Battle with the Queen of the Gorgons.\" For some reason reading this old tome gave me more meaning in my life then anything else I had ever experienced. I knew that this had to be a sign - my purpose in the world. Me and this ancient queen - this \"Mesmeralda\" - we had to be one!\nAfter this, I went about convincing the Marrow Drinkers of this truth, what did the Marrow Drinkers give me when they learned of my excellence?"

  nf_mdt.4.t:0 "A Dark Offer?"
  nf_mdt.4.d:0 "[MDT.GetName] are giving us a offer - they say that they are willing to help us clear out the super mutants to the south if we agree to submitting to them. While submission doesn't sound too good at the least we will be able to ensure that the Warren aren't able to conquer us if we listen to them."
  nf_mdt.4.a:0 "The Warren are our biggest concern, lets accept their offer."
  nf_mdt.4.b:0 "Submission is never a option! Lets fight on our own."
  nf_mdt.5.t:0 "They refuse!"
  nf_mdt.5.d:0 "It seems the Rib Breakers have a death warrant."
  nf_mdt.5.a:0 "Fine! I will conquer them anyway."
  nf_mdt.6.t:0 "They accept!"
  nf_mdt.6.d:0 "It looks like they aren't as dumb as they look, together we can put these Trolls under our heel properly."
  nf_mdt.6.a:0 "Great! Let us wipe out the Trolls together!"
  nf_mdt.7.t:0 "A Pact Perpetual?"
  nf_mdt.7.d:0 "Recently we have been approached again by the [MDT.GetAdjective], they seemed... more aggressive this time. Their \"Envoy\" speaking of our land as if it belonged directly to them. Now that we don't have to worry about the Trolls we don't have to listen to them, right?\n\nIf we accept this, it will likely mean our forced annexation in the near future."
  nf_mdt.7.a:0 "We can never accept this!"
  nf_mdt.7.b:0 "It looks like we have no choice..."
  nf_mdt.8.t:0 "The [RBT.GetName] have revolted!"
  nf_mdt.8.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] have betrayed us! They believe they are independent and that our deal was supposed to only be temporary!"
  nf_mdt.8.a:0 "I can't believe this!"
  nf_mdt.9.t:0 "They submit to us!"
  nf_mdt.9.d:0 "Soon their realm will be formally a part of mine, The [FROM.GetAdjective] not seeming as eager as they once seemed to try for independence."
  nf_mdt.9.a:0 "Good.."
  nf_mdt.10.t:0 "Heavy, the Oaken Crown"
  nf_mdt.10.d:0 "It has taken some time, years even for my schemes to finally come to fruition. All of Oregon is now seeing the world as I do - of the truth that I am the Gorgon Queen Mesmeralda and that they are my supplicants. It is finally time to bring together the kingdom's various vassals so they can watch me being crowned, to formally take on the title I was owed."
  nf_mdt.10.a:0 "Who is going to stop me now!?"
