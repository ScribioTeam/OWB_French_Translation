  tca_glorious_purpose_desc:0 "§g\"Human, Mutant or Ghoul, there is strength in us all.\nStrip yourselves of all false notions of individuality, you are nothing but ray clay from which a Brother may be born. There is no I, there is only We. And We are all that matters.\nYour squad; many minds with one purpose. Your weapons; strike fear into our enemies. Your vehicles; thunder towards a glorious destiny. There is only one way to get through this, that is together. Should you survive, you will be Steel.\"§!\n\n§OLance Squadron§!, what the §Y\"Washington Brotherhood\"§! was before the §RImmortal§! disobeyed the §OChains That Bind§! and broke off from their mission, was a squadron hailing from the §YMidwestern Brotherhood of Steel.§!\n\nThe Midwest, unlike many other chapters of the Brotherhood, believes in the principle of §OGlorious Purpose§!. That the Brotherhood is an embodiment of those serving underneath her - and thus, that no one individual can be greater then the whole.\n\nThis principle has led to the Midwestern Brotherhood being one of the most succesful branches breaking off from Lost Hills, abandoning the Brotherhood's usual stigma towards Ghouls and Mutants as long as they are loyal to the Codex.\nThe Immortal threatens to §Rbreak§! from their mission and have Lance Squadron go off on their own. Those loyal to §YThe Cause§! of the Midwest's grand ideals won't let that happen without a fight."
