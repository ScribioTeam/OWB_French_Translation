  dam_the_fifty_guns_tax:0 "The Fifty Guns Tax"
  dam_the_fifty_guns_tax_desc:0 "While the Lakota demean us as savage raiders, our real strength is our creative methods of taxation and government. Each state captain will be tasked with producing fifty guns for our stockpile. "

  dam_the_old_can_raid:0 "The Old Can Raid"
  dam_the_old_can_raid_desc:0 "Our farmers complain that forty year old's are too elderly to fight! Nonsense, why shouldn't a father join his son in murdering our neighbours?"

  dam_all_together_with_the_corps_desc:0 "A few young minds have suggested improving our propaganda methods. Apparently, people like it more when we remind them of our noble roots as the Army Corps of Engineers."

  dam_reinforce_authority_over_lakotas:0 "Reinforce Authority over the Lakotas"
  dam_reinforce_authority_over_lakotas_desc:0 "Our conquest of the Lakota precipitated a campaign of guerilla violence against our occupation. They must be reminded who controls their land now."

  dam_install_friendly_chiefs:0 "Install Friendly Chiefs"
  dam_install_friendly_chiefs_desc:0 "The Lakota would never accept a non-Lakota ordering them around. We do have a number of allies within Lakota society and installing them as provisional chiefs could satisfy some of the skeptical Lakota."

  dam_protect_major_roadways:0 "Protect Major Roadways"
  dam_protect_major_roadways_desc:0 "The Lakota guerillas have refined their tactics by attacking our major roadways. These strikes seriously hamper our ability to police the territory and have forced us to deploy new guards to patrol the roads."

  dam_more_than_savage_raiders:0 "More than Savage Raiders"
  dam_more_than_savage_raiders_desc:0 "We are a marauding, conquering army. We are also builders and inventors. Focusing more on the second part will convince people to accept annexation."

  dam_unquenchable_lakota:0 "The Unquenchable Lakota"
  dam_unquenchable_lakota_desc:0 "We are different from the government of old in at least some respects. We have no pretensions at erasing the Lakota or truly ever ruling them. Their fierce tenacity and unwillingness to lay down their arms has proven that completely."

  dam_a_puppet_to_appease:0 "A Puppet to Appease"
  dam_a_puppet_to_appease_desc:0 "The only sensible way to pacify the Lakota is to give them their own, reasonably independent, government. We'll have to take steps to ensure their adherence to our will, but unless a Lakota rules the Lakota there can never be peace in Crow Creek."

  dam_first_medical_team:0 "A New Field of Expertise"
  dam_first_medical_team_desc:0 "As helpful as our engineering teams are, each one that returns tells of the desperate need for doctors in most of the wasteland. While not our traditional area of expertise, we have the resources to send at least rudimentary medical teams into the wastes."

  dam_air_raiders:0 "Air Raiders"
  dam_air_raiders_desc:0 "Our ferocity on the ground can easily be rivaled in the air. Our enemies will soon know that even the sky is unsafe."

  dam_first_try:0 "First Try!"

This has led to some unexpected chemical reactions and the need to change our procedure."

  dam_disciplined_managers:0 "Disciplined Managers"
  dam_disciplined_managers_desc:0 "Our immense construction requisition list is infamous for its association with graft. Scrapyard managers take bribes to expedite requisition requests and are known to submit fraudulent requests to make themselves seem more important. Discipline is clearly required."

  dam_construct_new_trading_stations:0 "Construct New Trading Stations"
  dam_construct_new_trading_stations_desc:0 "Enhancing our supply network could help draw in scavengers looking to sell their wares in our competitors' territory. We must be careful to maximize our control of incoming salvage in the region."

  dam_sell_off_excess_scrap:0 "Sell Off Excess Scrap"
  dam_sell_off_excess_scrap_desc:0 "While our supply network is a useful tool, it does have a tendency to overflow our hubs with useless garbage. Passing off that junk as something worth paying for is a worthwhile endeavor."

  dam_learned_from_the_siege:0 "Learned from the Siege"
  dam_learned_from_the_siege_desc:0 "Misery is the only word capable of describing those months spent inside the Dam. Overcrowding, sickness, and the constant howling of the ghouls outside tormented our every waking hour. In those moments we became more than raiders with mechanical prowess. We became protectors."

  dam_overlords_protection_cost:0 "The Cost of Civilization"
  dam_overlords_protection_cost_desc:0 "The benefits we bring always have a price tag attached. We give the towns we protect our strength, and they reciprocate with their own work."

  dam_invite_refugees_to_dam:0 "Invite Refugees to the Dam"
  dam_invite_refugees_to_dam_desc:0 "The Dam is a symbol of hope and refuge for many who once lived there. The siege is over, but the Dam's capacity to act as an industrial heartland is not."

  dam_mil_overlords_protection_cost:0 "The Cost of Protection"
  dam_mil_overlords_protection_cost_desc:0 "Our rule includes military protection for our settlements. The people we protect know that it is in their best interests to support our protection squads."

  dam_recenter_industry_on_dam:0 "Recenter Industry on the Dam"
  dam_recenter_industry_on_dam_desc:0 "The Dam is already a core component of our industrial base. However, it also acts as a defining symbol of power. Making it the primary industrial center of our territory will make it an absolute showcase of our power."

  dam_enticing_the_lakotas:0 "Enticing the Lakotas"
  dam_enticing_the_lakotas_desc:0 "The Lakota have faced problems with water shortages in the past. Offering them water rations for their compliance is a guaranteed way to win over some of them."

  dam_migration_to_settlements:0 "Migration to Settlements"
  dam_migration_to_settlements_desc:0 "Some of more recent construction projects have involved constructing mechanical wells in settlements. These wells act as a community center, drawing small groups who live on the outskirts into our societies."

  dam_install_police_system_desc:0 "Overseeing the Lakota territories is done mostly through our raider groups stationed there. Constructing a formalized police system will help us control the population."

  dam_clamp_down_on_lakota:0 "Clamp Down on the Lakota"
  dam_clamp_down_on_lakota_desc:0 "Lakota resistance activities are often overlooked by our garrisons. We need to make in-roads within the Lakota population to root out dissenters."

  dam_reclaiming_the_land:0 "Reclaiming the Land"
  dam_reclaiming_the_land_desc:0 "Fields and towns were left barren and abandoned during the siege. The farmers that took shelter in our Dam must return to the fields and reclaim the land they've lost."

  dam_lighting_the_wastes:0 "Lighting the Wastes"

  dam_attack_lakota_stockpiles:0 "Attack Lakota Stockpiles"
  dam_attack_lakota_stockpiles_desc:0 "While we were under siege by the horde, the Lakota took their time stockpile weapons and ammunition. They left us to starve, so we will deprive them of the fruits of their labor."

  dam_take_lakotan_slaves:0 "Take Lakotan Slaves"
  dam_take_lakotan_slaves_desc:0 "The Lakota must be punished for their unwillingness to aid us in our time of crisis. When they awaken to their towns burning and friends stolen, they will understand a fraction of our pain."

  dam_probe_lakotan_defenses:0 "Probe Lakotan Defenses"
