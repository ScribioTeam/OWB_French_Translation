  MCA_origin: "Rebuilding America, Today!"
  MCA_origin_desc: "Once there was a nation that held that all men were created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  \n\nThat nation was mauled in the Great War. But we in the Enclave will never stop fighting for the American people."
  MCA_the_base: "From a Base Into a Home"
  MCA_the_base_desc: "Once a string of bases across America connected the United States government together, and many of these held out until the fall of Navarro. These embers of patriotism were kindled by Santiago into a new light, which shall guard the Wastes while it burns."
  MCA_the_families: "The First Families"
  MCA_the_families_desc: "The bombs glanced Missoula during the Great War, so while the city starved, its buildings survived. Today the city is dominated by the First Families, survivors of those who planned properly for the bombs."

  MCA_missoula_market: "The Missoula Market"
  MCA_missoula_market_desc: "Missoula's market is already the best in Montana. With some further renovations, it could be the largest as well."
  MCA_gibbonsville_outpost: "The Gibbonsville Outpost"
  MCA_gibbonsville_outpost_desc: "Gibbonsville has been abandoned since the Great War, but it still guards the the routes from Idaho. With proper fortifications in the region we can cut Heaven's Gate off in the passes."
  MCA_macarthur_arsenal: "A Shipment from Chicago"
  MCA_macarthur_arsenal_desc: "Chicago will be glad to send more assistance out west, but that may come with an understandable request for more assistance with the Great Work. But aren't all Americans in this together?"
  MCA_sharecropper_refugees: "Down on the Farm"
  MCA_sharecropper_refugees_desc: "One of the best uses for our refugees is to work on the farms and ranches outside Missoula. We can help provide them a new life as employees of the First Families."
  MCA_cars_of_our_own: "Fund The Crow Trucking Company"
  MCA_cars_of_our_own_desc: "The heroes of Montana are the Crows, whose trucks connect the North's settlements. The Garage in Missoula produces a handful of trucks a month, but with proper investment, and Enclave engineering, we could double, or perhaps triple, that!  \n\nThis will help not just the people of the North; it will also cement the Colonel's rule."
  MCA_anti_slavery_patrols:0 "Never Stop Fighting for the American People"
  MCA_anti_slavery_patrols_desc: "It is one of the greatest tragedies that so much of the Northern Commonwealth tolerates slavery. Whether they're 'servants' of Heaven's Gate, serfs of the Khan, or the Canadian proletariat, thousands outside our borders choke under bondage. We must open our hearts and settlements to them!"
  MCA_drill_the_army: "The Last Professional Army"
  MCA_drill_the_army_desc: "One advantage of §M[MCA.GetNameWithFlag]'s§! military force is that it is, by and large, still a trained military force. This gives us a rival over the rabble that surrounds our oasis of stability."
  MCA_old_depots: "The Survivalist Bunkers"
  MCA_old_depots_desc: "While some wonder why Colonel Santiago knew how to find the old survivalist bunkers, none can deny their value to the fighting men and women who keep watch over the region."
  MCA_bozeman_museum: "The Old Museum"
  MCA_bozeman_museum_desc: "Bozeman was once hold to the American Computer & Robotics Museum. At the time, these were obsolete artefacts. Today, these old devices are the Wasteland's cutting edge - and beyond."
  MCA_granite_company_home: "The New Home for Old Men"
  MCA_granite_company_home_desc: "A detachment of Enclave soldiers remained on the west coat as mercenaries, but perhaps it is time to call them home rather than waste their time serving the Salvatores or the Van Graffs. After all, we can think of no better men to garrison Granite Company than these fine fellows."
  MCA_granite_company_home_tt: "\nAfter so long on the margins of the Wasteland, §PSergeant Granite and his boys§! have found a home in 5.0!"
  MCA_tellurium_mines: "Subsidize the Tellurium Mines"
  MCA_tellurium_mines_desc: "Tellurium is one of the Earth's rarest metals, but invaluable for complex metallurgy. By loaning the First Families our equipment, they can expand their mining operations to supply us with this precious metal."
  MCA_paper_please: "The Montana Patriot"
  MCA_paper_please_desc: "The Montana Patriot was established in 2245 to explain to the Northern Commonwealth why the Enclave was there to help, and serves a valuable role giving the the truth straight from the Colonel's office. But with further funding we could expand our hard hitting exposes on the atrocities of the cultists and raiders outside our lands."

  MCA_garden_god: "God's Garden"
  MCA_garden_god_desc: "MacArthur Army Base is home to a unique set of greenhouses which grow tropical fruits not seen in the Rockies for almost two centuries. Oranges, avocados, bananas, and more are served on the Colonel's table, courtesy of what the natives call 'God's Garden'."
  MCA_marshalls: "The Marshals"
  MCA_marshalls_desc: "Led by Sheriff Heather, the Marshals serve as 'civilian auxiliaries' to MacArthur and enforce the Colonel's authority in Missoula and beyond. Increasing their ranks will bolster the United States Army's limited manpower out west."
  MCA_formosa_franks: "Formosa Frank's Firearms"
  MCA_formosa_franks_desc: "Some say Frank's family were held in Camp Little Guangdong when the bombs fell, but the way he tells it, they were loyal citizens. Whatever his family's backstory, he's long been the best weaponsmith in Missoula."
  MCA_electrify_lower_rattlesnake: "Light Up the Rattlesnakes"
  MCA_electrify_lower_ratltesnake_desc: "Little Rattlesnake is where the First Families of Missoula made their home, a lovely neighbourhood. We'll gain more support if we ensure they have adequate power."
  MCA_little_reno: "Little Reno"
  MCA_little_reno_desc: "The Salvatores came east from Reno with us after the fall of Navarro. Now one of them seeks to set up a charming little club to give people a taste of the flavours of the West."
  MCA_mac_machine_shop: "McSweeney's Machine Shop"
  MCA_mac_machine_shop_dsec: "McSweeney's faux Scottish accent (derived from holotapes and prewar recordings) is annoying, but none can deny that he runs the best machine shop in Missoula. Or the only one, if we're being honest."
  MCA_guitar_factory: "The Guitar Factory"
  MCA_guitar_factory_desc: "Bozeman was home to a mighty guitar factory before the War, and craftsmen continue this tradition to this day. Although some of the songs are surprisingly... unorthodox, none can deny the sweet sounds they play."
  MCA_highway: "Refurbish the Highway"
  MCA_highway_desc: "Montana's great highways have fallen into disarray, but [MCA.GetLeader] will spare no expense to improve the lives of her citizens. That this will help the Army travel is, of course, a nice benefit."
  MCA_bozeman_energy: "Harness the Bozeman Hot Springs"
  MCA_bozeman_energy_desc: "[HEA.GetNameWithFlag] think geothermal energy is the stuff of miracles, but it's nothing but American ingenuity. [MCA.GetLeader] will gladly provide heat and light to the refugees in the town."
  MCA_chicago_reinforcements: "Chicago Reinforcements"
  MCA_chicago_reinforcements_desc: "At [MCA.GetLeader]'s request, the Secretary of the Interior sent equipment west. Of course, this may require further attention to Chicago's directives..."
  MCA_little_slice_heaven: "A Little Slice of Heaven"
  MCA_little_slice_heaven_desc: "Citizens of Montana, this is your Colonel speaking. Have you ever thought how privileged you are? How fortunate? You live in the greatest state in America. Indeed, it could be said that Montana is the only America!"
  MCA_convoys: "The Convoys"
  MCA_convoys_desc: "Neither rain nor snow nor raider gang shall keep the convoys of Missoula from the road. Ain't they a beautiful sight? And one day, we're gonna roll this trucking convoy across the USA."
  MCA_defend_against_brotherhood: "Defend Against the Brotherhood"
  MCA_defend_against_brotherhood_desc: "We stand now at the precipice. The Brotherhood of Steel, in their arrogance, seek to replace your safety and freedom under the Enclave with tyranny and oppression. Let them come! Wave upon traitorous wave will crash against MacArthur's walls! The Brotherhood of Steel will fail! God bless the Enclave! God bless America!"
  MCA_victory_brotherhood: "The Fate of Traitors"
  MCA_victory_brotherhood_desc: "The Brotherhood is descended from scum who abandoned our people in their hour of need.  Fortunately, it is well established that 'Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death.'"
  MCA_brotherhood_atrocities: "Support the Brotherhood's Enemies"
  MCA_brotherhood_atrocities_desc: "People of Montana, we are all that stands between you and the destruction of our great state. Do you want mutants occupying your homes? Your children conscripted into their cult? Your wife or husband sent to a penal battalion to mine for uranium? Of course not. That is why we are here to help."
  MCA_greatfalls: "The Great Falls Restoration"
  MCA_greatfalls_desc: "Great Falls' position on the Missouri River provides ample hydroelectric power for use in a variety of industrial projects. No wonder the Brotherhood occupied this town. How fortunate that they have been liberated under our rule!"
  MCA_concessions_to_first_families: "First Family Investment"
  MCA_concessions_to_first_families_desc: "Sadly, the Brotherhood's occupation destroyed much of Missoula's leadership. If we want to restore the town's prosperity, it might be best to encourage the First Families to help."
  MCA_power_plant: "Expand the Dam"
  MCA_power_plant_desc: "Say what you will about the Brotherhood's levies, they did manage to restore the dam that once powered Great Falls. With our superior American engineering we can continue their work!"
  MCA_great_falls_university: "Great Falls University"
  MCA_great_falls_university_desc: "Although Montana's centres of higher learning did not survive the Great War, the Brotherhood's facilities give us a chance to start something of value in Great Falls. And surely no harm will come from concentrating the most educated people in the state in one location?"
  MCA_machine_shops: "Refugee Machine Shops"
  MCA_machine_shops_desc: "Many of those we freed from the Brotherhood picked up some useful skills working for the Brotherhood. We can give them their old equipment to open workshops in Great Falls."
  MCA_tiki_bar: "Salvatore's Tiki Bar"
  MCA_tiki_bar_desc: "It seems Salvatore wants to open yet another bar, this one inspired by an old pre-war Hawaiian establishment. Although a silly idea, he hopes to turn it into the anchor of a new market for the region. Who are we to stand in the way of progress?"
  MCA_markham_plan: "Markham's Plan"
  MCA_markham_plan_desc: "Markham hopes to use Steeltown to introduce some of Chicago's efficiency to the West. She's asked permission to run several workshops by algorithms and data, taking human bias out of the equation. Just like Chicago, in a way. \n\nWho can complain?"
  MCA_steeltown: "Steeltown!"
  MCA_steeltown_desc: "Under the Enclave's rule, Great Falls has turned from a Brotherhood of Steel work camp into a thriving hub of commerce. The nickname Steeltown reflects not just its origin, but its new hub as the heart of §P[MCA.GetName]§!'s economy."
  MCA_horrigan_ii: "Our Colleague"
  MCA_horrigan_ii_desc: "Not all the research from the Rig was lost. The Secretary of the Interior sent a soldier modified based on the research used on Frank Horrigan. The end is near - For America's enemies!"
  MCA_loot_brotherhood_stockpiles: "Loot the Brotherhood's Stockpiles"
  MCA_loot_brotherhood_stockpiles_desc: "Although the Secretary of the Interior would prefer to gain all knowledge and information we have on the Brotherhood, we could make use of those resources here. Doing so, of course, will annoy the Secretary of the Interior, who is our superior officer."
  MCA_give_to_chicago: "Send Salvage to Chicago"

  MCA_hesphaestus:0 "Stealing Fire From the Gods"
  MCA_hesphaestus_desc:0 "Yellowstone is home to one of Poseidon Energy's greatest prewar projects. But the idealists and dreamers who occupy Yellowstone today do nothing with it! Gaia's riches are there for taking - a power source that could fire the industry of the North."

## EventsGreat Falls' position on the Missou

nf_mca.1.t: "The Last Great American Dynasty"
nf_mca.1.d: "Many Wastelanders know America took a fatal blow in 2077, its armies and people burning in nuclear fire. But most of them don't know the tale of the men and women who kept the dream alive in the darkness that followed. The Richardsons served America after the Great War, preserving its dream and protecting its citizens, whether or not they knew it. An enclave of the best and the brightest, who would keep the torch of freedom lit until it could burn again. They were close too, you know. The last Richardson had a plan to save the Wasteland, a weaopn that would kill the super mutants and feral ghouls who held back recovery. Until it all fell apart. \n\nNobody knows what happened to the Rig. A Brotherhood of Steel commando raid? Remnants of the Master's army? Perhaps it was the Rangers, cloaking their hatred of America in their sweet lies of liberty. Certainly the NCR had no problem pouring north with tribals, Brotherhood paladins, and others in tow. The Enclave killed many, but we had to leave. With the chain of command in disarray, Santiago took off, and led the flight east. \n\nLet us honour her, and how she worked to save America in the West."
nf_mca.1.a: "She took as many noncombatants as she could..."
nf_mca.1.b: "But recognized weaponry would serve the survivors best."

nf_mca.2.t: "Men to Match These Mountains"
nf_mca.2.d: "When the Enclave fled the West Coast after the fall of Navarro, some fought on. Patriots who didn't give up on America journeyed east, by vertibird, truck, or by foot. Thundering gun battles echoed across the Great Plains as they carved through the Brotherhood's despotism to reach Chicago. But Santiago, and those who stayed? In the name of fighting a 'rearguard action,' they stayed at Navarro. With support from the Secretary of the Interior, they acted as the western flank of the Enclave. Gone was the President; but in its place was a land lightly touched by radiation, home to happy, healthy children. A land where old soldiers never died - they just faded away. \n\nFor something odd happened in the region. Over time to survive MacArthur began to trade with the surrounding towns and ranches. As relationships followed trade, soldiers turned into ranchers, medics into doctors.  When Missoula asked for help against Heaven's Gate in 2268, she was protecting her retired veterans as much as she was the people of the town."
nf_mca.2.a: "Missoula's ranches now feed the depot."
nf_mca.2.b: "And she turned the prisoners to coal mining."

nf_mca.3.t: "The First Families"
nf_mca.3.d: "Missoula was an odd town, for the Wasteland. The town had good, unpolluted farmland, herds of healthy bison, forests for timber nearby. Nobody went hungry. But in every society some are more equal than others, and Missoula was no exception. The First Families, descended from the scavengers who returned after the War, controlled the best lands; the best forests; and the best mines. Colonel Santiago's detachment only increased the division, for who but the rich could afford the Army Corps of Engineers? Moreover, the increased security Santiago brought turned the region into a magnet for refugees fleeing Heaven's Gate and the Khans. The lucky ones found jobs in sweatshops or farms. The unlucky ones? Well, there was a winter every year. \n\nOne of Santiago's more considered decision was the use of auxiliaries, trained with local equipment. Some favoured drawing forces from the First Families, but others counseled that the refugees would be reliable to whoever offered a better life."
nf_mca.3.a: "The First Famlies are reliable."
nf_mca.3.b: "But weren't we refugees as well?"

nf_mca.4.t: "Slander, Lies, and Treason!"
nf_mca.4.d: "The founders of the Brotherhood were deserters and traitors who abandoned the Greatest Nation on Earth in its hour of need.  Two hundred years later, little has changed. \n\nNow the Montana Chapter spreads lies and slanders about the Enclave's efforts to save America. Its paladins tell refugees and ordinary, hardworking citizens that our efforts to repair the mutations to humanity are 'genocide,' and concoct silly fantasies about a plan to wipe out every human. This is base slander! We're the government! We're here to help! But, unfortunately, some fools have been led astray by their lies."
nf_mca.4.a: "Unfortunate."
nf_mca.4.b: "Counteract their propaganda with the truth."
nf_mca.4.b_tt: "\n§MAvailable because you launched the Montana Patriot.§!"


nf_mca.5.t: "They Fight for Freedom!"
nf_mca.5.d: "Haven't I promised you that America yet lives? At great effort, the Secretary of the Interior has sent proof that the Enclave lives, Montana! And no, not just MacArthur Army Base. Right now Enclave troops are enroute from Chicago, the gleaming heart of America! These fine men and women have one mission - the restoration of American peace and order. \n\nJust remember. When you see the Enclave, you see the United States government. We are authorized to restore order and civility, by any means necessary. Just stay out of the way and let us do our job. Interfere with the Enclave's mission, and you will be dealt with. Harshly. \n\nTogether, we'll restore the glory of this great nation."

nf_mca.5.a_tt: "\nChanges §PSupport from the Secretary of the Interior§! by §Y5%.§!  You will lose §Y3 energy§! and §Y1 metal§! more going forward."

nf_mca.6.t: "The Mission"
nf_mca.6.d: "As the screen flickered to life, the Colonel wondered, once again, why the Secretary appeared like this. But she said nothing as the Old Man spoke. \n\nSo, you ground the Rebels under heel at last, hmm?' he chuckled. 'They say a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. So of course those mutants broke under American heroism.  Nevertheless, you are to be congratulated, Colonel. Or should I say Brigadier General!' \n\n'But the Brotherhood was there for a reason. I'm sure you can guess why, as our old struggle in the Heartland heats up. We need you, Brigadier. We need the Northern Commonwealth.' \n\nThe terminal next to the Brigadier flickered. 'I'm afraid your charges will need to contribute a bit more to the Reconstruction.' \n\nThe screen flickered off, with the neon light of Chicago replaced by a single message. 'God Bless the Enclave.'"
nf_mca.6.a: "And God Bless America."
nf_mca.6.a_tt: "\nChanges §PSupport from the Secretary of the Interior§! by §Y5%.§!  You will lose §Y5 energy§! and §Y5 metal§! more going forward."

nf_mca.7.t: "In the Army of the Enclave..."
nf_mca.7.d: "The resources of the Northern Commonwealth could turn the tide in the Heartland, and give the Enclave a chance to crush the Brotherhood once and for all. But alas, too few Americans are left to satisfy every front nowadays. [MCA.GetLeader]'s demands call for new sacrifices from everyone in [MCA.GetName], and there are three proposals to meet the Secretary's orders. \n\nThe easiest solution would be to appeal to Chicago for further assistance, in exchange for accelerating resource extraction in the North. We could also work with the First Families and the rest of the region's elite and rely upon their involvement. Although these would not be as powerful as the United States Army, they could supplement our ranks in additional battalions.  Finally, we could recruit the Refugees and Wastelanders, opening the doors to widespread recruitment."
nf_mca.7.a: "This job calls for professionals."
nf_mca.7.b: "Trust the Families and the Marshals."
nf_mca.7.c: "Every man who can carry a rifle is welcome to one!"

nf_mca.8.t: "A Fire Burns Beneath the Ground"
nf_mca.8.d: "The world was on the cusp of greatness, they say. Or was it hubris? Poseidon Energy drilled deep beneath the waves for the last of Earth's oil; they harnessed the sun to keep old Vegas ablaze; and in Yellowstone, once a park, they drilled into Earth's marrow for energy. \n\nMarvelous in men's eyes, all night and all day, unto them a fire blazed, tireless and unquenchable. Poseidon's Hesphaestus Project, they say, would have powered twenty million homes for thousands of years. They say it would have solved the Resource Crisis. Or, they say, it would set off a volcano, and another nuclear winter. But they say lots of things, don't they? Yellowstone's rangers refuse to activate the plant, but others wonder . . . "
nf_mca.8.a: "Think of what we would do with such power!"
nf_mca.8.b: "God shall condemn Man for such hubris."

nf_mca.9.t: "The Flame-Eyed Fire"
nf_mca.9.d: "At long last, our scientist discovered the secrets of the Hesphaestus Project. But what shall we do with this power? \n\nChicago would prefer we divert the energy back to them, a vital resource for their war against the Midwest Brotherhood. But Rodriguez would argue the energy serves a valuable role for the region, and could further industrial development. In this scenario, we might still send resources to Chicago - but it would be processed uranium, coal, and other riches pulled from the mountains. And then there is Maria, the Colonel's daughter. Maria proposes we share the power with the people. People power? A novel idea. It might, at least, gain us support among the locals... but it will certainly anger the Secretary of the Interior. Can we truly risk that?"

Team September's been tasked with dealing with it - how will Corporal Stimson respond? \n\nIt may be that Salvatore is trying to double cross us, and we can easily find evidence to bury him in a Little Golgotha along with the rest of his crew.

To this end, refugees are turned back at the towns' borders, but smugglers try to sneak them into our slices of pre-war America. Corporal Ellen and her team of Rangers captured the smugglers' ringleader, Mamma Cotton. Cotton refuses to stop helping these Wastelanders, but for now they are nothing but a drain on Missoula.

There are those who say she's gone native - those who whisper, indeed, that she may be a *mutant*. But if that were true, how could she handle the Enclave's weaponry so effectively? \n\nEllen's unit, Team October, guards the Wasteland and handles threats that need a special touch.

  nf_mca.15.d:0 "[MCA.GetLeader], undoubtedly afraid of our prowess, offers us tribute - energy weapons and caps, which we can use against the Brotherhood. Oh, we will; but surely she should know that these weapons can be turned against her as well?"
  nf_mca.15.a:0 "The Brotherhood, then MacArthur."


  nf_mca.16.t:0 "All the Secretary's Men"
  nf_mca.16.d:0 "History cannot stand still, and as our mighty nation approaches its 500th anniversary, new orders fly to Macarthur. America's heartland is ripe for liberation! The Midwest Brotherhood, a threat for so long, can be crushed - if only Macarthur helps. To that end, the Secretary of the Interior asks for Macarthur to increase resource shipments East, feeding the forges of Chicago. \n\nThe Secretary of the Interior wants us to crush the Montana Chapter, and subdue the Hesphaestus Project in Yellowstone. With those resources secured, we can give Chicago a mighty advantage in the war. And perhaps we can see if any of the old nuclear silos that protected America are still active.  \n\nColonel Santiago, time is of the essence. We need you to finish this work in the next few years. Your little slice of paradise must prepare for war."
  nf_mca.16.a:0 "God Bless the Enclave."

  nf_mca.18.t:0 "Who Are You, That Do Not Know Your History?"
  nf_mca.18.d:0 "The Historians, a group of scholars and teachers, have been conquered. Now they come to MacArthur, begging for a new home. There is much to be gained from them letting them in; while we know how to maintain advanced weaponsy and circuitry, some of the simpler arts are not really practiced in Montana. As such, their practial knowledge of farming could be useful to our citizens. \n\nBut isn't there a danger? They have a sadly corrupted view of history, a harshly negative view of prewar America. And we unfortunately would lack the strength to correct all of their errors. Colonel, what should we do?"
  nf_mca.18.a:0 "How dangerous could some historians be?"
  nf_mca.18.b:0 "Confiscate their resources for the war effort."

  nf_mca.19.t:0 "Grounded in Tradition, Resilient in Spirit"
  nf_mca.19.d:0 "[MCA.GetLeader] has come with a proposal - in return for economic assistance, our warriors will fight for the US government. The only downside is the risk of the Enclave should they prevail; a likely outcme, if their only true foe are boy scouts in power armour."
  nf_mca.19.a:0 "If they get this far, we will crush them easily."
  nf_mca.19.b:0 "Oh no, we're not doing this again."

  nf_mca.20.t:0 "The Mighty Braves"
  nf_mca.20.d:0 "[STR.GetName] sent warriors to us in return for our offer. How wonderful! They will gladly protect Macarthur's interests - even if Chicago might not see it that way, alas."
  nf_mca.20.a:0 "It's important to rely on friends."

  nf_mca.21.t:0 "A Deal is a Deal, Even With a Dirty Dealer"
  nf_mca.21.d:0 "The Americans are a treacherous brutal people who occupied Canada and exploited us for years, and followed up those atrocities with a nuclear holocaust.  That said, they have money, and who are we to systemic oppression stand in our way? [MCA.GetLeader] offered us a large chunk of caps in exchange for some old airships. Should we make a deal?"
  nf_mca.21.a:0 "We are a free people who believe in free trade."
  nf_mca.21.b:0 "What, so they can bomb us again? Pass."


  nf_mca.22.t:0 "Airships, Baby!"
  nf_mca.22.d:0 "The Brotherhood traverses the Wastes with a vast fleet of airship. Alas for us, we are forced to rely on jet aircraft, vertibirds, and mechanized units. Until now. Thanks to [TRR.getLeader] "
  nf_mca.22.a:0 "To the Whales of Liberty!"

yellowstone_output_tt: "Before the Great War, Poisedon Energy began to tap the magma beneath the Yellowstone Caldera to build the world's largest geothermal power plant. The Ecologists refused to finish their great work, but not everyone in the Northern Commonwealth is so idealistic. If activated, Hesphaestus could power the region and rival Hoover Dam."

  montana_scientists_bad_desc: "Although Colonel Rodriguez has helped develop Western Montana and brought law and order, MacArthur's research base cannot rival the bright lights of Chicago. As one of her few scientists lamented, it felt like the visionaries at MacArthur spent their time relearning basic techniques like crop rotation instead of harnessing the power of the atom or FEV as they did out east."

  MCA_markham_economic_advisor_desc:0 "Abigail came to Montana from the Chicago Enclave. She started her career as a line worker in a truck plant, working her way up to become an operations manager. She took a particular liking to automation and analytics, but eventually decided to start something of her own. After facing harassment due to concerns about 'genetic purity,' she walked out of the truck plant with a top engineer and went east. Now she hopes to run Great Falls into the Northern Commonwealth's workshop. \n\nSome say Abigail got the job when she offered ten trucks a month and the ability to use MacArthur's facilities to produce, albeit in limited quantitities, power armour. Others say she came west with secret instructions from the Secretary of the Interior. Whatever the rumours, none can deny that Great Falls is turning into a forge to rival the Pitt."

The Enclave took Mason with them when they fled east, and he's managed to set up shop in Missoula. Some wonder why the Colonel tolerates Salvatore and his illicit connections, but she remembers how well those ties served out west..."
