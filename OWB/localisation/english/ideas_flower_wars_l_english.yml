  flw_the_flower_wars_desc:0 "Following the defeat of the Aztlan at the hands of the Itzan Kalomte Sebastián II, the once brutal wars fought between [ITZ.GetNameDef] and [ATE.GetNameDef] have settled into a cautious status quo. Under the pressure of hardliners and in an effort to maintain foreign prestige, neither side can dare to attempt a cessation of hostilities, but both sides see merit in limiting conflicts between the two Mesoamerican superpowers. Clashes still occur between the giants on an almost daily basis, however, though these are usually restricted to short-lived firefights between border patrols. \n\n§RWhilst we have this national spirit, we will be unable to justify wargoals on any foreign power.§!"
  flw_holds_la_tumba:0 "Occupier of La Tumba Compartida"
  flw_holds_la_tumba_desc:0 "Thanks to our recent victories in the Flower Wars, we are the occupiers of La Tumba Compartida. This has given us some significant stability, as our people can sleep safer knowing that we hold this buffer between ourselves and our enemies, but has also decreased their appetite for a fight!"
  flw_not_holds_la_tumba:0 "Enemy Occupation of La Tumba Compartida"
  flw_not_holds_la_tumba_des:0 "Despite our best efforts, we do not currently exercise control over La Tumba Compartida. Our people are troubled by this but are more willing than ever to fight to recover it!"
  flw_holds_hela:0 "Occupier of He'la' Uuchben Ts'oon"
  flw_holds_hela_desc:0 "Our constant struggles in the Flower Wars have resulted in victory, and as a result we control the contested state of He'la' Uuchben Ts'oon. Our people are safer knowing of our prowess, but [ROOT.flw_enemy] will no doubt attack it soon!"
  flw_not_holds_hela:0 "Enemy Occupation of He'la' Uuchben Ts'oon"
  flw_not_holds_hela_desc:0 "Whilst we boast a might fighting force, we can't expect to win every battle, and due to recent stinging defeats [ROOT.flw_enemy] has occupied He'la' Uuchben Ts'oon. We must strive to bring it back into the fold!"
  flw_holds_mexico_city:0 "Occupier of Mexico City"
  flw_holds_mexico_city_desc:0 "Mexico City, the once grand capital of Mexico, was decimated by nuclear fire soon after the start of the Great War. The nuclear hellfire triggered a mass migration from Mexico City, and other major cities, to the Itzan and Aztlan Empires. Whilst, therefore, not a major strategic target, our occupation of Mexico City is still a huge boost to our presige."

Whilst, therefore, not a major strategic target, [ROOT.flw_enemy] occupation of Mexico City severely hurts our national pride."
