  nf_mlt.1.d:0 "The Destitute of the Deadwood did not take kindly to the flames of war.\nAfter the new world was made from the ashes of the old those the survivors were left but not a single road to travel. No purpose - for the fires not only burned their homes, but their very identity.\n\n\"How do we live in a world like this?\" Asked the once-soldier.\nHe was right, humanity as it was wasn't meant for this world. Quickly, the destitute began to lose hope. The fruits they ate to nourish themselves slowly draining away at their minds as their bodies wasted away from radiation.\nIt would take a new way of survival to survive through this age. For now? The destitute would have to survive.\nWhich fruits did the ruddy man pick?"

  nf_mlt.2.d:0 "After one is hurt, the scars might last forever. The pain? It fades away.\nThe destitute were led by the Ruddy Man in their early years, a helpful soul eager to guide the addled and drugged back on the roads set out for them, to find them a new identity.\nThe Ruddy Man taught the destitute to let go of the past, to see forwards, rather then back. They began to watch the ways of the wildlife of the Crowlands, in particular - to the Mirelurks.\nThe Mirelurks, unlike the humans were made for this world - and thus, they thrived in it. Long after the Ruddy Man left the destitute they would continue to watch the wilds and copy them, dipping their newborns in the swamps and feeding exclusively on the same florescent Muttfruit that the Mirelurks fed on. Eventually, after enough years the Mirelurks began to no longer see the destitute as a threat, they were but one people.\nHow long would this transformation have taken the destitute before they saw themselves this way as well - as the Mirelurk Tribe?"

  nf_mlt.3.t:0 "Legacy of the Ruddy Man"
  nf_mlt.3.d:0 "For many in the wasteland the Mirelurk tribe have taken our way of life too far.\nThe Mirelurk Tribe has all but embraced their identity as Mirelurks-in-Human-Skin, they wear old Mirelurk carapaces as armour, use their slime to colour their skin and protect their eggs at all cost.\n\nIn recent years however, this dynamic has changed. A group of wise men and oracles known as the 'Coral Court' have taken control of the Mirelurk Tribe to \"Help the tribe on their path\".\nThese Oracles attest that the Ruddy Man wasn't a man, but a Mirelurk Queen of old! Under the Coral Court the Mirelurk Queen M'lulu, a great Mirelurk Queen that the Court protects utterly is treated as a god - of the Bloodline of the Ruddy Man and heir to the coasts of Oregon.\nAmong many of the Mirelurk tribe its hard to say weather the Coral Court uses M'lulu to control the tribes bidding, or if M'lulu uses both the Tribe and the Coral Court as underlings to help spread her domain.\nWhich do you feel is right?"
  nf_mlt.3.a:0 "None stand above M'lulu"

  nf_mlt.4.d:0 "The Mirelurk Tribe has given us a strange offer today. One of their shelled envoys has asked that they give us some of our land in exchange for a harvests worth of Muttfruit. The land they are asking for isn't particularly valuable either, maybe we should consider this offer?"
  nf_mlt.4.a:0 "Trade land for that fruit!"
  nf_mlt.4.b:0 "No thanks, we like land."

  nf_mlt.5.t:0 "Trade Rejected!"
  nf_mlt.5.d:0 "It seems they value their land more then our Muttfruit!"
  nf_mlt.5.a:0 "Well then!"

  nf_mlt.6.t:0 "Trade Accepted!"
  nf_mlt.6.d:0 "We have managed to ship off the Muttfruit to their capital and they have given us the land in question."

  nf_mlt.7.d:0 "Finally! It is time for the hatching! Only once every few decades can the tribesmen of the Mirelurk witness a new generation be born like this. All across the Tribe many are coming together to work harder for this - to build up the tribe and prepare for the new influx of Mirelurks that will spread out across the land."
  nf_mlt.7.a:0 "For M'lulu!"
