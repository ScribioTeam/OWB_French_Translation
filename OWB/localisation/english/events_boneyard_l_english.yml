  nf_boneyard.1.t:0 "The City of Lost Angels"
  nf_boneyard.1.d:0 "The city of Los Angeles must have been the largest in the world before the War. The L.A. Boneyard stretched forever, the skeletons of buildings lying under the hot sun. Not even the wind entered this dead city. When the bombs fell millions perished, but survivors slowly rebuilt, as they emerged from the Control Vault. The towns of the Boneyard; Adytum, the Fortress, and others, slowly knit themselves into a community.  Adytum provided raw materials and food; the Gun Runners provided firearms. \n\nAnd the Followers of The Apocalypse? They provided hope."
  nf_boneyard.1.a:0 "Adytum is among the most prosperous towns in the Republic."
  nf_boneyard.1.b:0 "The Gun Runners are the arsenal of plutocracy."
  nf_boneyard.1.c:0 "The world tends to destruction, so we try to make a difference."

  nf_boneyard.3.d:0 "'Allgood Murphy' earned his nickname from his iconic speech in 2273, celebrating the NCR's expedition into the Mojave. In his speech, he stunned the crowd, and those listening on NCR Radio, with his speech that 'All is Good. \n\n'There are no raiders within the NCR. There is no corruption within the NCR. There is no want or poverty in the NCR. Nor is there a threat from the Brotherhood. No, all is good. Let us therefore use all of our wealth to not address any concerns that may remain, and see what we find in the Mojave.' \nMurphy's speech catapulted Murphy to national fame, and his subsequent efforts to attack corruption in the Hub only helped. \n\nAllgood stands for truth, justice, and the Californian way, opposing those who want to walk the dark path that destroyed the Old World."

  nf_boneyard.5.t:0 "Welcome the Followers"
  nf_boneyard.5.d:0 "We have been friends of the NCR for decades, and our scholars have attended the Boneyard University. But the Followers which to formalize our arrangement and build a campus in San Francisco itself. They will teach and heal, and we shall, in turn, send a delegation to the Boneyard.  This will of course cement our alliance with the best the NCR has to offer."
  nf_boneyard.5.a:0 "Wheresoever you go, go with all your heart."
  nf_boneyard.5.a_tt:0 "Should more come of Boneyard's dreams, we will be invited to make the Wastes a better place.§!"
  nf_boneyard.5.b:0 "If you think for a year, plant a seed; if for ten years, plant trees."

  nf_boneyard.6.t:0 "Shi Teachers"
  nf_boneyard.6.d:0 "The Shi seek to harness the power of the atom, the wind, sun, and sea. Their industrial base has been to small to make these dreams a reality, but the engineering base of Adytum and the Boneyard give their dreams a new life. Let us follow each other into a brighter future."
  nf_boneyard.6.a:0 "It does not matter how slowly you go so long as you do not stop."

  nf_boneyard.7.t:0 "Shi Rejected Us"
  nf_boneyard.7.d:0 "The Shi have never fully been part of New California, and their rejection of a Follower presence is just more of the same. At least we can use those resources here."
  nf_boneyard.7.a:0 "Everything has its beauty, but not everyone sees it."

  nf_boneyard.11.t:0 "The Power of the Hub"
  nf_boneyard.11.d:0 "The Hub and Boneyard are integral parts of the NCR, and unfortunately we are... a military expedition dependant on their support.  To that end, [ALL.GetLeader] demanded a share of Hoover Dam's power.  Although they are offering to restore a generator in return, this will obviously be a net loss."
  nf_boneyard.11.a:0 "We have no choice but to comply."
  nf_boneyard.11.b:0 "Alas, the paperwork got mired in Shady Sands."

  nf_boneyard.12.t:0 "The Mojave's Treasure"
  nf_boneyard.12.d:0 "Despite his own qualms, Murphy was able to lobby the Mojave Territory to divert power to the Hub. While this weakens his own pacifist stance, it does help the people who elected him. And is that not the most important thing?"
  nf_boneyard.12.a:0 "The citizens are my boss, after all."

  nf_boneyard.13.t:0 "The Broken Spokes"
  nf_boneyard.13.d:0 "The Hub has not always been the biggest proponent of the NCR. The Hub was initially afraid of the Shady Sands-Junktown alliance that created the NCR, and only 55% of its citizens voted to join the NCR in 2186; a number that to some degree reflected a feeling that all of the Hub's neighbours were going to join anyway. But this is not to knock the Hub; although the Vault Dweller called it a 'desolate place' where the 'People had no life,' his perspective was somewhat biased by the thermonuclear device he set off in the Cathedral.  In reality, the Hub is prosperous and no worse than much of the NCR, home to gangs, major businesses, and a separatist movement who is tired of Shady Sands' mismanagement. The Hub elected Murphy as governor in 2274 as a protest against Shady Sands' expansionism that brought little benefit to many of the towns' citizens.  \n\nMurphy will need to bring the gangs in line, restore the Hub Police, and balance tensions between the Hub's business interests if he is to restore the town's support for the NCR."
  nf_boneyard.13.a:0 "Let us stand together."
  nf_boneyard.13.a_tt:0 "\n§gThe Boneyard starts with a resistance movement to reflect gangs and lack of control over the city. Perhaps you can change that?§!"

  nf_boneyard.14.t:0 "The End of War"
  nf_boneyard.14.d:0 "The Brotherhood fought a long and difficult war over how to use technology in the Wasteland. The NCR prevailed, by and large; but at a bloody cost. Even now the Brotherhood's remnants still harass our nation. \n\nMurphy proposes to treat for a formal peace, ending our frozen conflict. But he will offer the Brotherhood resource rights in our territories in exchange."
  nf_boneyard.14.a:0 "Peace at any price."
  nf_boneyard.14.a_tt:0 "This will grant the Brotherhood resource rights in Blackwells and Glennville."
  nf_boneyard.14.b.:0 "Never!"

  nf_boneyard.15.t:0 "The End of War"
  nf_boneyard.15.d:0 "We fought and bled to keep the NCR from meddling in technology they were meant to know. \n\nWe failed.  Now we are reduced to hiding in our bunker. Some of our leaders propose we formalize our peace with the NCR, and divert our focus outside California. Others, while recognizing that the time is not ripe for a full scale war, think we should keep our frozen conflict going. If we accept the peace treaty, we will gain resource rights in Maxson."
  nf_boneyard.15.a:0 "We will make a peace with honour."
  nf_boneyard.15.b:0 "The Brotherhood never gives up."

  nf_boneyard.17.t:0 "Peace With Honour"
  nf_boneyard.17.d:0 "Thanks to [BON.GetLeader], the NCR and Brotherhood have come to terms. In exchange for a few trinkets and minor tariffs, they have recognized our mastery of California. Let them hide in the darkness of their bunkers; the people of California will spread across the Wastes, under a clear sky."
  nf_boneyard.17.a:0 "All's Good in Maxson."

  nf_boneyard.18.t:0 "A Boneyard Expedition"
  nf_boneyard.18.d:0 "The Boneyard is a curious place; the heart of the NCR's war machine, but also home to the pacifists of the Followers. [BON.GetLeader] has come to us with a proposed deal, hoping to build on First Citizen Lynette's time there. The Boneyard will provide us with military equipment in exchange for access to some of our civilian technology. Given the need to stand on our own two feet, perhaps we should consider this offer? As Lynette knows from her time there, they are rather civilized, for Californians."
  nf_boneyard.18.a:0 "Trade can help everyone."
  nf_boneyard.18.b:0 "We must stand alone."

  nf_boneyard.19.t:0 "Tales From the Vault"
  nf_boneyard.19.d:0 "Vault City is no paradise, but it has come a long way from the 2240's. Whatever their feelings towards the NCR's foreign policy, we have shown that we can build ties based upon sharing ideas and ammunition. The Gun Runners' shipments have left us well compensated with medical equipment. And surely [VLT.GetLeader] would never be so foolish as to threaten the Bear."
  nf_boneyard.19.a:0 "Sharing resources is the core of the Follower credo."
  nf_boneyard.19.a_tt:0 "\nWe get a free trade route with Vault City!"

  nf_boneyard.20.t:0 "[VLT.GetLeader] Disappoints"
  nf_boneyard.20.d:0 "While we would have hoped Vault City learned from decades of NCR oversight, their leader has rejected our proposed trade agreement. On the upside, the Gun Runners will invest their resources in the Boneyard instead."
  nf_boneyard.20.a:0 "Good luck with your raider problem."

  nf_boneyard.21.t:0 "Trade With the Boneyard"
  nf_boneyard.21.d:0 "The Boneyard is a curious place; the heart of the NCR's war machine, but also home to the pacifists of the Followers. [BON.GetLeader] has come to us with a proposed deal, hoping to build on our people's ties to the region. The Boneyard will provide us with military equipment in exchange for access to some of our civilian technology. Perhaps this is the start of warmer ties between the home of the Followers and the Vault Dweller's family?`"
  nf_boneyard.21.a:0 "Trade can help everyone."
  nf_boneyard.21.b:0 "We must stand alone."

  nf_boneyard.22.t:0 "Thanks Again for Killing the Master"
  nf_boneyard.22.d:0 "The poor people of Arroyo, scattered after something happened to Vault 13, have found a new home in the north. Remaining true to the Vault Dweller's ways, they have agreed to a trade agreement between the Boneyard and their new home. Perhaps we can bring "

  nf_boneyard.24.t:0 "The Water Barons"
  nf_boneyard.24.d:0 "Inflation is a fact of life in much of the NCR, which is one reason people have turned to caps.  That said, even caps have their limitations. Caps are promise from water merchants to provide water from towers and other depots to traders travelling across the miles of desert between the Mojave and the Boneyard. Unfortunately, this lets the water merchants edge into trade, bleeding the NCR's supply lines dry. \n\n[BON.GetLeader] could work with the Hub's merchants, promoting their control over the supply line. Or he could promote the interests of the NCR as a whole, and develop state-backed supply lines across the region."
  nf_boneyard.24.a:0 "The Water merchants are our voters!"

  nf_boneyard.26.t:0 "The Followers University"
  nf_boneyard.26.d:0 "Thanks to the support of [BON.GetLeader], the Followers of the Apocalypse have flourished. The Followers have spread from the Boneyard across much of the Wasteland, healing the sick, teaching the ignorant, and never, ever, giving up hope. \n\nOnce points of light in the dark, the Followers are now a sea of stars, ready to begin the next great work. Unlike the Brotherhood of Steel, the Followers have proposed a visiting scholar program to encourage the free exchange of ideas."
  nf_boneyard.26.a:0 "Though the world tends towards destruction, let us try to make a difference."
  nf_boneyard.26.b:0 "Huh, interesting."

  nf_boneyard.27.t:0 "One Loan At a Time"
  nf_boneyard.27.d:0 "While there are many who criticize the small-time lenders of the Hub as loan sharks and extortionists, their supporters are influential. The lenders fill a need where the Republic does not, keeping the wheels of commerce rolling with a bit of grease. Were Murphy to crack down on them, it would be a painful process to rebuild the Hub's banks; but in the long term, the Republic will undoubtedly be better off."
  nf_boneyard.27.a:0 "They've certainly been friendly to me!"

  nf_boneyard.28.d:0 "[BON.Getleader] approached us with a trade deal to build ties between the Boneyard and New Reno. We will freely advertise for tourists in the Boneyard in exchange for opening our market to the Gun Runners, the merchants of the Hub, and the Followers. This will strengthen both our communities, but we can always say no if we think the Boneyard is growing too powerful."
  nf_boneyard.28.a:0 "We welcome their caps and firearms!"

  nf_boneyard.29.d:0 "[NEW.Getleader] agreed to our proposal! Although we may frown on their... vices, each person has the right to live as they please, and Reno is certainly preferable to Mr. House. In exchange for promoting tourism between Reno and the Boneyard, they have agreed to favorable deals with our merchants.
