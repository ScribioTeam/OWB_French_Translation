  #Fun fact: Aider wrote these events in secret before he was even a developer! I "smuggled" them in, which translates to "nobody knew violet collaborated with a regular in the main Discord"

  PRO_mole_boss_name:0 "Boss Morghorl"
  PRO_mole_king_desc:0 "More clever and vicious than his many coworkers, the glowing boss of Far Son has whipped them into a frenzied warband ready to follow his every whim. Those whims are mostly violent or involve the gathering of supplies for muddled plans to “expand” their mining operations. Whatever he chooses to pursue, destruction will follow."
  SIE_chief_name:0 "Chief Orange-Sky"
  SIE_chief_desc:0 "Though leading his people on a journey of their own, Orange-Sky keeps alive in his heart the words of a long past elder “Always Take Care of One Another”. Those words have caused him to pause and take up the defense of Rawlins Township against the dangers that beset it. Compassion tempers his bold and decisive nature, and his age has not dulled his aim with a rifle or his piloting of a motorcycle. He has no intention of failing in his duties, neither to his people or those he has sworn to protect."
  SIE_cowgirl_name:0 "Ophelia "Killer Queen" Mayweather"
  SIE_cowgirl_desc:0 "With the beasts from beneath the earth banished, and the Arapaho having resumed their long journey south, it has fallen to Sheriff Mayweather to lead the people of Rawlins and the surrounding area into the future. Inspired by the banner hanging in the center of her hometown, she is determined to revive the “clean and quiet Wyoming” that her ancestors once enjoyed. Headstrong, proud and a crackshot, she intends to put the leadership skills she’s learned from the Chief to the test."

  wyoming_1:0 "The Steppes of Wyoming"
  wyoming_1_desc:0 "Wyoming's been a stopping place for many over the years. It's a shame the calm never lasts..."
  wyoming_2:0 "Alton Bourges' Legacy"
  wyoming_2_desc:0 "Jealousy can be a powerful and destructive force."
  wyoming_3:0 "War in Wyoming"
  wyoming_3_desc:0 "Mole Miners burst forth from the Far Son crater and beyond. With these terrible monsters leaving their hovels, it became evident the plains were no longer safe for travelers... Something would have to be done, or else they wouldn't ever stop."
  
  wyoming_left_opener:0 "The Fields of Wyoming"
  wyoming_left_opener_desc:0 "Wyoming is a vast and beautiful land, full of opportunities for growth. We must take advantage of it, so that our children may live easier."
  wyoming_caps_1:0 "Harvesting the Nuka-Cola Factory"
  wyoming_caps_1_desc:0 "To the north, a Nuka-Cola factory lays derelict. We can salvage the bottles inside for caps, and maybe have a little R&R along the way, if there's enough cola to be had..."
  wyoming_caps_2:0 "Steppes Caravaneering"
  wyoming_caps_2_desc:0 "Vast steppes for miles, and nothing but vast tracts of land in-between. While many great ranches dot the landscape, few connections have been established between such places. Encouraging caravaneering would be key to reasonable economical growth."
  wyoming_manpower:0 "The Wyoming Calm"
  wyoming_manpower_desc:0 "The calm chill of Wyoming is inviting to much of the wasteland. With rumors of our hard work, likeminded individuals have begun to arrive from all over."
  wyoming_manpower_dos:0 "The Settling Winds"
  wyoming_manpower_dos_desc:0 "The settling winds of Wyoming have been an inviting premonition to travelers and wayfareres alike. Dozens of people pass through our lands, more and more staying every day..."
  wyoming_waterways:0 "The Waters of Wyoming"
  wyoming_waterways_desc:0 "Though they are far from safe to drink in such times, the lakes and rivers of Wyoming are far better than others found in the wasteland. With enough jury rigging, we can establish a set of purifiers to help us with thirst."
  wyoming_factory_1:0 "The Refineries"
  wyoming_factory_1_desc:0 "Though they most certainly stain the views, numerous derelict factories dot the landscape. Let's see if we can't get some of them back online!"
  wyoming_plants:0 "A Home on the Frontier"
  wyoming_plants_desc:0 "No matter how amazing a land may be, without food to sustain it, it won't host anything for long. Looking into agricultural concerns would suit us well."
  wyoming_research:0 "Nowhere Can Be Home, Too"
  wyoming_research_desc:0 "Wyoming's a beautiful place, though most certainly nowhere. But where else is there to be in this world, if not nowhere?"
  wyoming_escapes:0 "An Escape From Hardship"
  wyoming_escapes_desc:0 "Many people stayed in Wyoming by accident. Maybe their caravan fell apart, maybe they just liked the people, or maybe it was just the weather. These people are quick to chat up the newcomers, and work with the locals."
  wyoming_power:0 "Rebooting Power Stations"
  wyoming_power_desc:0 "The stars can only guide us so well. A proper power station would help us see at night! And, well, a heater-- if we can find a functioning one, that is-- wouldn't hurt, either."
  wyoming_tools:0 "Tools to Build a Home"
  wyoming_tools_desc:0 "Scavenging is the baseline of any wasteland society, a trade both despised and respected by the majority. Equipping scavengers to go and see what they can get will save us a lot of legwork."
  wyoming_comp:0 "Building Ourselves Up"
  wyoming_comp_desc:0 "To build a civilized society, you must be capable of building in the first place. The scavengers we've employed and the power station will help us get the proper equipment to try and start expanding."

  wyoming_right_opener:0 "The Fires Upon the Hills"
  wyoming_right_opener_desc:0 "The frontier may be mostly peaceful, but times grow tough and some folks desperate. Change must be made."
  wyoming_army_exp:0 "Hunting Wild Beasts"
  wyoming_army_exp_desc:0 "There are many horrible creatures that roam the fields of Wyoming at night; most of them tragic leftovers of Alton Bourges' carelessness in times gone by. Hunting them will not just make the land safer but improve the finesse of our warriors."
  wyoming_war_support:0 "Hearts, and Minds"
  wyoming_war_support_desc:0 "A people ready to defend themselves will answer a thousand more calls to action."
  wyoming_right_assymmetry:0 "Outsmarting Our Betters"
  wyoming_right_assymmetry_desc:0 "Many great forces surround the lands of Wyoming. What if one tries to breach our safety? We know the land better than anyone; we won't just make use of it, we'll make it part of our advantage."
  wyoming_training_idea:0 "A Trained Populace"
  wyoming_training_idea_desc:0 "A gun in everyone's hand is one thing, but without the know-how to sling it, it's as useful as a bag of dirt in a drought. Training exercises won't just help folks know what to do; it'll save a lot of lives in the process."
  wyoming_planning:0 "Planning a Way Ahead"
  wyoming_planning_desc:0 "Our warriors have done much to protect our citizenry. Exalting them for their repeated victories would be appreciated, no?"
  wyoming_cute_idea:0 "Friendly, but Territorial"
  wyoming_cute_idea_desc:0 "A cautious hand can be better than a welcoming one. At least, that's what most people think after trying to pet a mountain lion!"
  wyoming_arms_fact_1:0 "Factories for the Fire"
  wyoming_arms_fact_1_desc:0 "There's a fire in every working individual's heart, a passion for a craft that is untapped. Why not let them express themselves with productive means?"
  wyoming_arms_fact_2:0 "Factories for the Folks"
  wyoming_arms_fact_2_desc:0 "A reasonable society is formed off of a system of mutually-agreed tasks. The wasteland is a harsh place, and many folks crave some sort of purpose. To protect ourselves and to brighten the minds of our people, we will facilitate the construction of new workshops across Wyoming."
  wyoming_homeland_idea:0 "Homeland Doctrines"
  wyoming_homeland_idea_desc:0 "We have no need for anything but home. Turning our minds inward will bring about a true era of peace."
  wyoming_expansion_idea:0 "Expansion Doctrines"
  wyoming_expansion_idea_desc:0 "An outward way of life is the only way to ensure our own personal safety. We will venture out and vanquish threats before they can reach our doorstep."
  wyoming_idea_coalesce:0 "The Coalescence"
  wyoming_idea_coalesce_desc:0 "Wyoming's our home, and if we have anything to say about it, it always will be."
  
  sie_cowboys_and_tribals:0 "Orange-Sky, Meet Ophelia"
  sie_cowboys_and_tribals_desc:0 "When the Arapaho came to Rawlins, people were worried things might get even worse. When they lent a hand and helped stop the attack, some say there was a golden glint in the Sheriff's eye: that she grew a confidence in that very moment that she and Orange-Sky first shook hands."
  sie_tribal_measures:0 "The Arapaho Braves"
  sie_tribal_measures_desc:0 "The Arapaho had fought many groups over the years, and honed their skills and trades with great care. Their extensive knowledge, if shared, would teach many of the Rawlins regulars a thing or two about dealing with the Miners."
  sie_two_sides_alike_in_troubles:0 "Two Groups, Alike In Troubles..."
  sie_two_sides_alike_in_troubles_desc:0 "With the Arapaho and the Ranchers of Rawlins both down on their luck, there is a risible sense of togetherness among the two groups: an idea that maybe they weren't alone, after all. As the Sheriff walked through the street, she made a note of something she hadn't heard in weeks: she heard laughter. Some of the Arapaho were regaling some of the Ranchers in the bar with a tale of their own trials, and she couldn't help but crack a smile. Maybe things weren't so bad..."
  sie_old_cowboy:0 "The Rawlins Rangers"
  sie_old_cowboy_desc:0 "Many of the Rawlins regulars were just ranchers with too much firepower on their hands, oftentimes coming into town just because the taps still worked. However, with the Mole Miner threat, many of them have begun to try to organize even without Ophelia's militia efforts. Calling themselves the 'Rawlins Rangers,' these aptly named gentlemen armed their brothers and sisters with well-kept firearms, one stating they were "aged like a fine, crystalline wine.""
  sie_medicine_men_with_medicine_sticks:0 "Orange-Sky's Teachings"
  sie_medicine_men_with_medicine_sticks_desc:0 "Orange-Sky was a peaceful man at heart, but he knew the world could be cynical to its people. It was simply the way of things. To combat this, he had spent a great deal of time practicing medicine and helping those in need. With the Mole Miner scourge erupting across Wyoming, sharing this knowledge, he thought, was obligatory."
  sie_cowboy_equipment:0 "Cowboys Will Be Cowboys"
  sie_cowboy_equipment_desc:0 "Ophelia had a plan. It was silly, but she knew silly better than any other bastard on the steppe did. By her recollection from when Ol' Slimey Pete was running around, he had left a stash of dynamite underneath Rawlins that he wanted to use to blow the bar sky-high. With a rub of her chin, she pondered: "now what if we threw that at the miners?""
  sie_safety_in_wyoming:0 "Safety in Wyoming"
  sie_safety_in_wyoming_desc:0 "The Arapaho and the Ranchers stood side-by-side on main street, dancing and sharing in the festivities as peace had come to the Steppe once again. No longer would the Mole Miners be an issue, Ophelia thought, but Orange-Sky was resolute. He and his people had somewhere to be."
  sie_the_federation:0 "The Rawlins-Arapaho Federation"
  sie_the_federation_desc:0 "Orange-Sky, upon further thought, realized that maybe they could find a home with the Rawlins regulars. Many of them had already befriended a great deal of his people, and were more than willing to accept them and all that they had. So, then, they agreed to organize: the Rawlins-Arapaho federation, a nation dedicated to upholding the peace in Wyoming, and taking great care of its vast beauty."
  sie_foundations:0 "Foundations For Home"
  sie_foundations_desc:0 "Orange-Sky and Ophelia knew that if another threat like the Mole Miners came, that they wouldn't be wholly ready. They set out for a plan to construct a new set of factories, entirely dedicated to the betterment of Rawlins and its environs..."
  sie_provide_for_our_own:0 "Providing For Our Own"
  sie_provide_for_our_own_desc:0 "There was much left in the wreckage of Far Son that could be harvested freely with the Far Sons themselves gone. An expedition will be arranged to gather all that can be found, and then Orange-Sky vowed to ensure that the people would live in a powered, water-filtered town."
  sie_workshopping:0 "Frontier Workshopping"
  sie_workshopping_desc:0 "While some minor foundations had been set for a semi-standing military, Orange-Sky and Ophelia agreed that they should be focusing more inward than outward. The people of Rawlins had many demands, and they could be met with time. "Why not make your home a paradise," as Ophelia would say."
  sie_a_beautiful_land:0 "A Beautiful Land, To Be Appreciated"
  sie_a_beautiful_land_desc:0 "The work of the Federation did not go unnoticed for long. Many flocked to Wyoming in droves, smiles on their faces turned wide as they saw the great signs outside Rawlins saying "welcome home.""
  sie_pathfinders:0 "Pathfinder Training"
  sie_pathfinders_desc:0 "The Arapaho knew much more of the land than the Ranchers did. They were willing to learn, and the Braves were willing to teach, and so an unofficial treaty was signed: the pathfinders would be both groups side-by-side, brothers by brothers, sisters by sisters."
  sie_arapohe_capstone:0 "The Wind In Our Hair"
  sie_arapohe_capstone_desc:0 "The Arapaho, in lieu of other ways to travel the plains quickly, had used motorcycles in past to travel. While convenient, their burgeoning populace demanded more, and so they set out to improve: proper, functioning vehicles that could tear across the steppe with ease."
  
  sie_cowboys_ride_alone:0 "The Cowboys Will Ride Alone"
  sie_cowboys_ride_alone_desc:0 "Ophelia was saddened by Orange-Sky's departure, but with a wave, and a friendly wink, she knew it was over. They left as quickly as they came, and so she had to turn back to the people of Rawlins, just as she had in years past."
  sie_wyoming_formable:0 "To Bring About Peace"
  sie_wyoming_formable_desc:0 "With Black Canyon's raiders, the paranoid madness of the Lonetree, or even the supposed 'Great Khans' that were causing a ruckus up north, Ophelia started to realize that maybe they weren't as safe as they had been before. If the Arapaho hadn't come in at the last second, Rawlins would surely have fallen-- maybe precautionary measures would be best, she thought..."
  sie_wyoming_once_again:0 "Equal Rights"
  sie_wyoming_once_again_desc:0 ""Equal Rights," they once said. The state motto of what once was the state of Wyoming. Ophelia figured it was as good a saying as any, and so she kept it: after all, a little bit of equal rights is all anyone could expect in such a world."
  sie_wyoming_roads:0 "Roads For Travellers and Frontiersmen Alike"
  sie_wyoming_roads_desc:0 "Ophelia practically spat out the toothpick when she had the thought. With all the chaos in Wyoming, and the vastness of the Steppe, what few roads that remained were in incredibly poor shape. If she was to encourage any form of economic our outward growth, they would need to be restored. At least, well, to the best degree that they could manage..."
  sie_the_guns_of_wyoming:0 "The Guns of Wyoming"
  sie_the_guns_of_wyoming_desc:0 "While Far Son's ruins were host to many old armories from the Alton Bourges' catalogue, many were no doubt scattered around from protestors and company police alike. Gathering these old dusty things and learning a thing or two about how they work will help us understand our own better."
  sie_wyoming_armories:0 "Breaching Far Son's Armories"
  sie_wyoming_armories_desc:0 "The Far Sons had plenty of caches from before the war with advanced military weaponry. Why not take what we can and see what happens?"
  sie_wyoming_rangers:0 "Wyoming Trailblazers"
  sie_wyoming_rangers_desc:0 "Many of the old 'Rawlins Rangers' were getting the hang of the whole "man-on-the-frontier" thing, and were overjoyed to share their knowledge with more and more folks. Ophelia'd always grin, and say "have at it.""
  
  pro_out_of_the_mine:0 "Sixteen Tons"
  pro_out_of_the_mine_desc:0 "The Mole Miners emerged not as a line, but as a horde from South Pass Mine. Rumors were simple, but the legends scarier: the Mole Men stalked the night, taking people and object alike, dragging them into the night."
  pro_rockets:0 "Unreasonably Strong Firepower"
  pro_rockets_desc:0 "The Moles were noted by travelers to be well-armed with a mixture of military-grade hardware and 'heavy mining equipment,' as Alton Bourges had once called it. Whether or not they knew how to repair or make more of these weapons was a mystery in and of itself."
  pro_rockets_red_glare:0 "Comically Strong Mining Equipment"
  pro_rockets_red_glare_desc:0 "Alton Bourges was a rambunctious man: a man who knew how to take a venture and make it into a billion dollars, or so he thought. Spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on both a personal military in Farson and military-grade equipment tends to bite one's bank."
  pro_research:0 "Superior, If Oddball Firepower"
  pro_research_desc:0 "Various weapons, new and old, would find their way into the Mole Miner's little crooked fingers. Some say they would take them down to be smelted, somewhere deep in the mines, or that they would be alternated as offerings to some strange, dark god that lurks in the tunnels."
  pro_melee_weaponry:0 "Handmade Claws"
  pro_melee_weaponry_desc:0 "As if they knew what they had become, some of the Mole Miners would fashion these strange, splinter-edged gauntlets from old mining equipment. Though they were naught but scrap, many travelers who went too close to Far Son would be found not long after with their throats and chests caved in. Those who survived would often have a tetanus story to share afterwards."
  pro_mole_miner_gauntlets:0 "Mole Minin' Gauntlets"
  pro_mole_miner_gauntlets_desc:0 "The gauntlets were well-made, for what they were. The miners began to standardize them as they learned how effective they were, taking means to improve their ability to make them."
  pro_wyoming_assertions:0 "Wyoming Falls"
  pro_wyoming_assertions_desc:0 "The Mole Miners charged as a swarm would across the open plains, killing senselessly and looting as vagabonds would. What once was a peaceful frontier, has now since returned to being one-- but the rivers run red, and there is nothing left but the fires."
  pro_wyoming_dominance:0 "Wyoming, Dominated"
  pro_wyoming_dominance_desc:0 "The Miners didn't take long to move in. How could anyone stop them? The Watch that had so heroically assembled had fallen, despite their best efforts to stem the moletide. Now, the Boss was in charge, yet that wasn't even the worst part. The worst part was that he was dissatisfied."
  pro_the_western_run:0 "The Soot Moves West"
  pro_the_Western_run_desc:0 "Lonetree was a perfect choice for the Boss. It would secure a wider berth around the South Pass and Far Son, allowing a longer front to be maintained against the surface dwellers."
  pro_the_southern_run:0 "A Mine Deeper Than Our Own"
  pro_the_southern_run_desc:0 "The Boss was enraged to learn of the legendary 'Deepmines,' and swore an oath that it would be in Mole Miner hands in no time. How could they be Mole Miners, and not have the deepest mine? He set out to correct this fact as soon as possible."
  pro_the_southerner_run:0 "Bones To Rend"
  pro_the_southerner_run_desc:0 "The Dry Bones meant nothing to the Boss. He was more interested in the strange, misshapen creatures that emerged from Burham Springs: the Gehenna and the Molech. Though he didn't understand them, he sought to control them as any tyrant would. First, however, he would have to secure their land..."
  pro_the_southernest_run:0 "Ending the Cycle"
  pro_the_southernest_run_desc:0 "The Boss' greatest foe, Ouroboros, stood tall against him: warriors who fought with the night just as he did. That vile woman Hecate and her lacky Jordan Dae had become his greatest nemesis seemingly overnight, and he swore an oath to rend them from the Earth completely."
  pro_the_wyoming_heirs:0 "What's Deep Is Now, Uh, Ours"
  pro_the_wyoming_heirs_desc:0 "The Deepmines were where they belonged: under Mole Miner control. Now, the Boss could live with relative peace knowing his mine was the deepest in all the land."
  pro_among_the_giants:0 "Among the Giants"
  pro_among_the_giants_desc:0 "The wretched creatures from Burham Springs were resistant for a time, but soon the Miners figured out how to weaponize them just as others had, and so the dark armies of Far Son grew in even more horrible ways..."
  pro_down_with_darkness:0 "Down With The Darkness"
  pro_down_with_darkness_desc:0 "With Ouroboros and its surrounding environs now under the control of Far Son, the Boss set his sights on another foe: Battery of Mesa Verde and the men and women of the Black Canyon. Their land was too vast and their influence too great on the western mountains. They had to go, lest the Boss go mad from rage."
  pro_west_we_shall_go:0 "West We Shall Go"
  pro_west_we_shall_go_desc:0 "To many, Utah is a land of religions and gods vying for souls and land alike. The miners have no gods and no cares for souls, but the Great Salt Lake that lies at the heart of that land calls them nonetheless. A rich source of many minerals and resources, the boss desires it, and so the miners will go."
  pro_northern_glories:0 "The Northern Glories"
  pro_northern_glories_desc:0 "To the north the Boss turned himself then, towards the homes of metal clad humans and their arsenals of weaponry. Hungry for their wealth and craving violence, he whipped the miners into a frenzy and lead the way into old Montana."
  pro_the_east_shall_know_pain:0 "The East Shall Know Pain"
  pro_the_east_shall_know_pain_desc:0 "With their tunnels and lairs teeming and the boss hungry for more minerals and territory, it was no surprise when the first mole miners began to trespass into the lands once known as Colorado. With Morghorls hungry eyes upon their wealth, those great rocky mountains will be the next to fall."
  pro_atomic_mining_techniques:0 "Atomic Mining Techniques"
  pro_atomic_mining_techniques_desc:0 "The Mole Miners do not celebrate their successes but Boss Morghorl could not help but spend the day barking happily after inspecting the newest pile of loot dragged before him. In the center of the heap, buried under an old chryslus was a crate of untouched mini nukes."

### Written by Aider.Alvin, who I conscripted to the mole miner infested localization mines ###

  nf_wyoming.1.t:0 "Fools & Frauds"
  nf_wyoming.1.d:0 "To many, the steppes of Wyoming were a welcome escape: a lonesome road for travelers on their way to the woeful lands of Colorado, or a steady trail on a pilgrimage to legends of civilization to the west. However, in the days just before the war that broke the world, that peace and solitude was shattered irrevocably. With the arrival of the Alton Bourges Mining Concern in southern Wyoming, it was not long before economic and ecological chaos broke out. Despite heavy protest from many local towns and ranchers, the company purchased much of the region's land and all its mines. \n\nSetting up a new HQ in the tiny town of Farson after evicting the inhabitants, it was not long before their drills, explosives and picks started to shake the very land apart. Working in a frenzy, they were setting up dig sites and new massive drills as quickly as possible. While many locals were hired to help construct these new machines and excavations, there was little to no regard for safety and the promised pay was, as unfortunately expected, slow to come. With injuries and fury over bounced checks mounting, soon the Concern’s dig sites were picketed by a number of protestors and concerned citizens decrying both the slapdash operation and the rumbling that could be felt coming from under Farson at nearly all hours of the day. The company did find the money to pay for a security staff to keep out those protesting and any other troublemakers, with more arriving by the day.\n\nIn truth Alton Bourges had spent nearly every penny he had on this venture, hoping to make an enormous score under the nose of his larger rivals. He’d spent much time in the Appalachian hills, spying on the activities of other companies. In particular his eye was upon the Atomic Mining Services, and their experiments with nuclear mining and the discovery of ultracite. Determined to recreate their success and results, he pushed his staff and miners to start blasting before the last of the cash dried up. On October 15th he got what he wanted, and much more. The dirty bomb the company had procured went off without even a modicum of the safety measures those in the east had used and turned Farson and much of the area into a radioactive nightmare. Relief efforts had barely begun when the rest of the world followed into irradiated madness. \n\nWhat supplies had been gathered for relief before the bombs dropped?"
  nf_wyoming.1.a:0 "Stockpiles of Medical Chems."
  nf_wyoming.1.b:0 "Supplies of Fresh Water."
  nf_wyoming.1.c:0 "Crate after crate of thirst-quenching Nuka-Cola!"

  nf_pro.1.t:0 "They Came From Below" #MINER VERSION
  nf_pro.1.d:0 "In the years after the bombs fell, Wyoming became a land of hardship and desperation for many. Few bombs fell in the state itself, but around the old Far Son radiation still spewed out into the air at regular intervals and poisoned the immediate surroundings. The rest of the former Alton Bourges Mining Concern’s dig sites were no safer, and those who were wise gave them a wide berth. Instead those who had lived nearby went east and settled around the town of Rawlins, which had been a proud base of operations for those opposed to the Mining company before the war. Ranchers and farmers, cowboys and survivalists slowly trickled into the area to all pitch in and rebuild. They watched as cattle turned to brahmin, taters to tatos and the first ghouls emerged from sweeping radstorms. \n\nUnbeknownst to them, something stirred in the tunnels to the west, as one by one the mines collapsed by the blasts long ago were reopened from the inside. Wearing heavy uniforms and masks all emblazoned with faded Alton Bourges logos, mumbling and gasping men emerged into the sunlight for the first time in many decades. At first their neighbors in Rawlins Township had no idea what to make of these strange folks, but when they began arming themselves and stalking the trails for people to snatch up it became clear they meant nothing but trouble. Attacks slowly escalated year by year, and soon there were few who dared to live outside the makeshift walls of the town. \n\nWhat did the mole miners arm themselves with?"
  nf_pro.1.a:0 "Repurposed excavation equipment."
  nf_pro.1.b:0 "Leftover security firearms."
  nf_pro.1.c:0 "Explosives!"
  
  nf_pro.2.t:0 "Dig, and Dig, and Dig"
  nf_pro.2.d:0 "The former employees of the Alton Bourges Mining Concern, when they weren’t wandering the countryside looking for materials and prey, often milled about the mines they had been trapped within. They were often aimless and confused, even scuffling amongst themselves over the shiniest of junk or most dangerous of weapons. They were still a threat to the people in neighboring lands and travelers but not one unified in purpose enough to pose a threat to a fortified township like Rawlins. That changed when the ground at the Far Son began to crumble away and a new group of mole miners emerged. \n\nAt their head was a truly vicious and cunning example of their kind, Boss Morghorl, who none of the other moles would dare to challenge. At his side was a small troop of glowing ghouls, carrying the gear and weapons of the security staff that once protected Alton Bourges property from the Wyoming locals. Most were as dim and confused as their miner colleagues but one still had a somewhat intact head on his shoulders: former security chief Montague. Together the two wasted little time in browbeating the various scattered groups of mole miners into something resembling an organized warband. \n\nThey were first instructed to gather a stockpile of:"
  nf_pro.2.a:0 "Weapons of all kinds."
  nf_pro.2.b:0 "As much scrap as they could carry."
  nf_pro.2.c:0 "The electronic guts of old machinery."

  nf_pro.3.t:0 "A Good, Clean Operation"
  nf_pro.3.d:0 "With a cacophony of rattling breaths and irritable grunts a team of mole miners, two dozen strong, made their way into the clearing outside Boss Morghorls lair. More of their coworkers watched on from the loosely assembled barricades the creatures had erected to defend the irradiated ruin from any who’d dare to trespass. These arriving miners were a scavenging pack, sent out to bring back anything useful that could be carried. Some carried the scrap metal, weapons and batteries they were expected to retrieve; things that could be used for the Bosses plans (even if none of the miners had a clue what those plans actually were). The rest however had their arms and pockets full of new items: bottles of beer and spirits as well as boxes of cigarettes and chems. \n\nAs they dumped their loot in a great pile Security Chief Montague crawled forth from his collapsed office, several of his glowing lieutenants in tow. He quietly hissed with delight while stealing fearful glances at the lopsided building the Boss would surely emerge from sooner or later. Drool dripped from his luminescent jaws as he scooped up the various intoxicants, either stuffing them into the gaps and pockets of his armor or shoving them into the arms of his subordinates. The miners milled about, watching this display with disinterest and confusion and waiting for the Boss to emerge. The chief had impressed upon the team before they left that such items were vitally important but they couldn’t fathom why. Most of the booze and chems had been carried away and hidden within the collapsed ruins the security crew dwelled inside when heavy stumping footfalls echoed from inside the Boss’s lair. \n\nMontague hesitated by the spoils pile as the rest of the ghouls scattered out of view, trying to see if anything was left and not wanting to be seen running away. Morghorl emerged from the shadows of his home, bending down to fit through the doorway, and moved to inspect the scavenger packs offering. All of it met with his silent approval until he reached down to retrieve a single bottle of beer, barely visible in his huge hands. Montague first avoided his bosses glare then attempted to make an endearing smile with his remaining three teeth. Such tactics did little to blunt the huge mole man's rage, and Morghorl hurled the bottle into his security chief's face. A single angry bark from the boss made it very clear to the miners and the stunned ghoul that no more time was to be wasted on such worthless treasures."

  nf_sie.1.t:0 "They Came From Below" #RAWLINS VERSION
  nf_sie.1.d:0 "In the years after the bombs fell, Wyoming became a land of hardship and desperation for many. Few bombs fell in the state itself, but around the old Far Son radiation still spewed out into the air at regular intervals and poisoned the immediate surroundings. The rest of the former Alton Bourges Mining Concern’s dig sites were no safer, and those who were wise gave them a wide berth. Instead those who had lived nearby went east and settled around the town of Rawlins, which had been a proud base of operations for those opposed to the Mining company before the war. Ranchers and farmers, cowboys and survivalists slowly trickled into the area to all pitch in and rebuild. They watched as cattle turned to brahmin, taters to tatos and the first ghouls emerged from sweeping radstorms. \n\nUnbeknownst to them, something stirred in the tunnels to the west, as one by one the mines collapsed by the blasts long ago were reopened from the inside. Wearing heavy uniforms and masks all emblazoned with faded Alton Bourges logos, mumbling and gasping men emerged into the sunlight for the first time in many decades. At first their neighbors in Rawlins Township had no idea what to make of these strange folks, but when they began arming themselves and stalking the trails for people to snatch up it became clear they meant nothing but trouble. Attacks slowly escalated year by year, and soon there were few who dared to live outside the makeshift walls of the town. \n\nWhat was the pride of Rawlins?"
  nf_sie.1.a:0 "Huge herds of hardy Brahmin!"
  nf_sie.1.b:0 "It's cunning hunters and cowboys!"
  nf_sie.1.c:0 "Crafty gun and ammo smiths!"

  nf_sie.2.t:0 "Hope Unlooked For"
  nf_sie.2.d:0 "Hope was running low in Rawlins, as the mole miners' attacks intensified by the day and the populace huddled behind the walls with guns at the ready. Unable to tend to the brahmin or retrieve food, the creatures had inadvertently besieged the townsfolk. On one gusty morning however, an outbreak of gunfire and war cries signaled a turning of the tide as a well armed and numerous party of newcomers struck the bewildered deep dwellers from behind. The molemen panicked and fled back west towards their tunnels, as the people of Rawlins cheered for their saviors. It was not long before those outside the walls called for Rawlins to open the gates and send someone to meet their leader. \n\nSheriff Ophelia Mayweather stepped forth, the de facto leader of the Rawlins Township, head held high but heart filled with a mixture of relief and nervous energy. The leader of the newcomers was an unassuming older man with a hard face but eyes filled with compassion. He introduced himself as Chief Orange-Sky, and his people as the Arapaho nation. They had come from the northwest on a great journey south, but had stopped upon seeing the dire situation of the town. Speaking long into the night, their meeting ended with Orange-Sky as the head of a new coalition that would stand against the monsters from beneath Far Son until they were no more: the Highland Watch. \n\nWhat did the Arapaho bring with them in excess?"
  nf_sie.2.a:0 "Guns and bullets to secure the way."
  nf_sie.2.b:0 "Caps and valuables to barter and trade."
  nf_sie.2.c:0 "Motorcycles to scout the wide open spaces."
  
  nf_sie.3.t:0 "Whether to Follow the Wind"
  nf_sie.3.d:0 "    It had been only a handful of days since the scouring of Far Son and the rest of the mole men’s lairs. Many of the Watch were still being treated of their wounds, or chasing scattered miners into the hills, but the most important matter on everyone’s minds was what happened now. Back in Rawlins, many people were celebrating their triumph, breaking out steaks and bottles of Old Roamin’ for the biggest party they could manage. While the streets buzzed with cheer and activity, there was a reserved tension within the town hall. Within, numerous figureheads gathered to decide the future of the Highland Watch and the two peoples who had come together to form it. \n\n Chief Orange-Sky and Sheriff Mayweather, naturally, were the leaders: the same heroes who had slain Boss Morghorl. The purpose of the discussion was to determine whether the time had come for the Arapaho to move on and continue their journey south, or if perhaps they should make a new home for themselves here with the people of Rawlins and to stay for good. \n\nMany had made their cases, each speaking before the chief in turn, knowing that his word would be the last. Two Eagles argued loudly that they had only barely begun their journey, that if they were ever to make their way to Oklahoma and find their southern kinsfolk they needed to move on as soon as possible. Water Fly countered by saying that no one was even sure the southern Arapaho still existed. \n\nWhen the last of the Arapaho had spoken, Sheriff Mayweather stood up to speak, her hat gripped tight in her hands and close to her chest. “Now, it ain’t really my place to say too much about all this, but if ya’ll decide you need to go, then you need to go. I think we all understand that. But I do want to say somethin’, anyway: ya’ll are the best damn neighbors we could have asked for, and we’d all be mole food or somethin’ by now without you. Well, I don’t know if they eat, really, but you know what I mean. We’d love for you to stay and help us bring this whole area back from the dumps. I ain’t too sure if we can do it without you, though I’m damned sure gonna try either way. That’s, uh-- that’s my piece.” She sat her hat back on her head, respectfully withdrawing as the other townsfolk in the room nodded and murmured in agreement. \n\n When the room had gone silent it was time for Chief Orange-Sky to declare his decision."
  nf_sie.3.a:0 "Enchanted, they Would Stay In Rawlins."
  nf_sie.3.b:0 "Alas, but the Arapaho Must Move On..."

  nf_sie.4.t:0 "Friendship"
  nf_sie.4.d:0 "It had only been a short time since the siege of Rawlins had been broken by the arrival of the Arapaho nation, but much had been done already. Walls were being repaired, pairs of scouts  had been sent out in all directions and the caravan of the new arrivals had been set up into a makeshift town of its own. Despite the threat that still hung over them all, the people of Rawlins had celebrated their deliverance with a feast of freshly slaughtered Brahmin and toasted their new Arapaho allies with whatever alcohol they had left. A hopeful and comradely air had quickly settled over both peoples, as they swapped stories and made plans for the future. \n\nWind rushed through the streets of Rawlins two days after the party, past two figures seated at a table near the center of town. Chief Orange-Sky and Sheriff Ophelia Mayweather shared lunch and cigarettes while speaking of what had happened and what was to come. Over them hung a banner that had been in place as long as anyone in Rawlins could remember, the faded words upon it reading ‘Rawlins for a Clean and Quiet Wyoming’. Not far from the two were several arapaho warriors showing a group of the local townsfolk how to clean and service a motorcycle, and a group of children dashing about and playing ‘shoot the mole’. \n\nAfter finishing the last of her steak, Ophelia asked the Chief what had been on her mind since she had first met the man: “Why did you risk your people to help us? Why are you still risking it?” \n\nChief Orange-Sky drained the last of his bottle of Old Roamin’ Walkers Ale and looked away for a moment before fixing his gaze directly on Ophelia’s. “When you are a leader, you will always be taking risks. It’s choosing the right risks to take that are the important part. For me, and my people, this was always the right risk to take. Had we looked upon you in your time of need and turned away, we could not have looked each other in the eyes for shame. Leaving you now would be little better. Some of it is undoubtedly pride but there are words I have carved into my heart, words from a past elder.”  \n\nThe old chief's eyes went distant and wistful, as if he was suddenly somewhere else. Ophelia waited patiently for him, studying the lines in his face. Orange-Sky then shook his head lightly before continuing “He said to us, ‘Always take care of one another.’” The two sat then in silent thought for a long while, one thinking pensively of the past and the other excitedly of the future."
