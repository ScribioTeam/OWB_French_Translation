  WYR_brahmin_baron_desc:0 "Ruthless pragmatism is the name of the game for Baron Bailey, the self-styled tycoon who controls his land with an iron fist. Presenting himself as a soft-spoken rural statesman, in his bowler hats and fine vests, he can be quite charming as long as it suits him. He can only be trusted in word or deed as far as it benefits him however. There is little he won’t stoop to in pursuit of wealth and power as long as his own neck isn’t put on the line, with mercenaries, surprise attacks, deals with those even less reputable than himself and a cruel cunning all having played their part in getting him this far, but like any man of his breed it isn’t enough to satisfy."

  wyr_elite_mercenaries_desc:0 "The mercenaries employed by the baron are the best of the best, and fit his ruthless expansionist mantra of "bigger is better" to a high degree. After many years of service, they've become deathly loyal to him-- and will fight to the death for a slice of their pay."
