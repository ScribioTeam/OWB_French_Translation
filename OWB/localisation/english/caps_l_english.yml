Secondly, there are a limited number of bottle caps, which preserve their value against inflation to some degree. For similar reasons the East Coast merchants also recognize bottle caps as a currency. Their earliest recorded use by survivors originates in Appalachia as of 2106."

As an act of protest, they are dismantling the factories that supply our forces as well as staging march-outs, and our arms productions capabilities are quickly going down the drain. While our forces can probably draw on our reserve weapons stockpiles, we obviously can't do it for a prolonged period of time, let alone in a war with another nation.

It was genius, no more couriers and mole rats work for scraps. \n\nThe one issue we did not anticipate, however, was that mole rats don't enjoy boxes attached to them.
