  fp_history_1:0 "The Smoke and the Fire"
  fp_history_1_desc:0 "When the Bombs dropped, we were prepared. A collective effort of all of our people brought together funding, scientific knowledge, engineering prowess and spiritual guidance to keep us save underground while the smoke and the fire washed over the earth."
  fp_history_2:0 "Emerging from the Earth Once More"
  fp_history_2_desc:0 "As our earliest ancestors emerged from the ground in the time of legends to claim these lands, so did we once more."
  fp_history_3:0 "The Accord"
  fp_history_3_desc:0 "Separate in land, but together in spirit. We wrote down everything we needed to guide our nations into the future."

  fp_industry:0 "Addressing the Local Situation"
  fp_industry_desc:0 "If we want to continue to improve, we need to curry favour with one (or all) of the major groups in our nation. We have some options on how to accomplish this."
  fp_industry_tt:0 "§gYou can gain a total of 12 points of support for the two factions in your nation in this branch. These are required later to unlock more focuses. Plan ahead accordingly so you don't lock yourself out of something you might want.§!"
  fp_support_clans:0 "Support the Clans"
  fp_support_clans_desc:0 "A significant part of the people of our nation lives in rural areas and are largely self-governed and self-sustaining. We need to reassure them our decisions won't negatively impact their way of life, while also trying to bring them closer into the fold. We can't be a powerful nation during these times if everyone is doing what they want."
  fp_support_cities:0 "Support the City Dwellers"
  fp_support_cities_desc:0 "The City Dwellers are more in line with our goal of a strong unified nation. To gain favour with them comes mostly down to shaking the right hands and making the right promises."
  fp_improve_clan_housing:0 "Improve Clan Housing"
  fp_improve_clan_housing_desc:0 "While the people of the clans are unwilling to change their ways completely, there are ways how we can improve their quality of life significantly without hitting too much opposition. Better housing for the average member of one of the clans will hardly get too many people upset."
  fp_reclaim_skyscrapers:0 "Reclaim the Skyscrapers"
  fp_reclaim_skyscrapers_desc:0 "Even though the City Dwellers live, as the name suggests, in the cities, very few of the pre-war skyscrapers and high-rises are actually inhabited. This is due to the often dreadful state of especially their upper floors. 200 years of the elements beating on those buildings led to missing walls, collapsed floors and various other issues. If we fix just some of them, we will open a lot of space for further ventures."
  fp_clan_farmsteads:0 "Subsidize Clan Farmsteads"
  fp_clan_farmsteads_desc:0 "Giving a healthy cash infusion to the various independent farmsteads will allow them to produce more, giving them the option of selling the surplus back to the market, which in turn allows us to support a larger population. Everybody wins."
  fp_free_streets:0 "Clear the Streets of Rubble"
  fp_free_streets_desc:0 "In some of our cities getting from point A to point B is a serious struggle due to collapsed buildings and various other debris blocking streets and walkways. If we don't want people to make a short trip through the sewers, up and down a three story building and slide down a zip line just to buy food one street over, we need to do something about that."
  fp_black_drink_bottling_plant:0 "Open a Black Drink Bottling Plant"
  fp_black_drink_bottling_plant_desc:0 "The Black Drink is a traditional caffeinated beverage of our people. If we can brew it on a larger scale and bottle it, we can sell it to people as a fresh new alternative to the local pre-war favourites Bawls or maybe even Nuka Cola. We should consider getting rid of the whole vomiting after drinking it bit though. That aspect would probably hurt the bottom line."
  fp_organized_scavenging_teams:0 "Organized Scavenging Teams"
  fp_organized_scavenging_teams_desc:0 "There are a lot of pieces of machinery and vehicles in varying states of functionality just lying around our cities. Unused and unclaimed. We need to send out dedicated teams of scavengers and mechanics to comb everything we own for anything that can be either repaired or repurposed."
  fp_reopen_coal_mines:0 "Reopen Coal Mines"
  fp_reopen_coal_mines_desc:0 "While the petroleum and gas deposits have been drained long before the Great War, a lot of the regional coal mines are still workable. Since they tend to be on the outskirts of urbanized areas they often fall into territory claimed by one of the clans. Reopening them will give us a good supply of fuel and other components and bring good work to those areas."
  fp_fund_local_arms_factories:0 "Fund Local Arms Factories"
  fp_fund_local_arms_factories_desc:0 "The clans tend to have their own weapon smiths and forges. They usually produce high quality goods, but don't have the output to supply larger forces with enough equipment. Funding them to provide them with the necessary manpower and tools they need to ramp up production will help them prosper and give us another source of weaponry."
  fp_traditional_values:0 "Traditional Values"
  fp_traditional_values_desc:0 "While many of our customs and traditions were seen as antiquated and outdated before the war, a lot of them became relevant again when the world descended to a simpler state. There are many people still following these traditions that would be a boon to our nation, should we hire them."
  traditional_values_tt:0 "Multiple §YClans advisors§! become available for service."
  fp_repair_industrial_complexes:0 "Repair Industrial Complexes"
  fp_repair_industrial_complexes_desc:0 "There are plenty of pre-war workshops and factories scattered around the major urban areas we control. Getting some of them into working condition will improve our industrial capacity, while we also may learn one thing or another about building new ones."
  fp_hunt_down_weapon_stashes:0 "Hunt Down Weapon Stashes"
  fp_hunt_down_weapon_stashes_desc:0 "The time shortly before the war was not a quiet one. Our records show there was a lot of civil unrest in cities that we claim as ours. Riots. Insurgencies. These things are long in the past now though. But what that means for us now is that if we can find out the old bases and hideouts of those insurgents, there are bound to be stockpiles of weapons and supplies that should still be usable."
  fp_the_new_expansion:0 "The New Expansion"
  fp_the_new_expansion_desc:0 "Now that we have a stable backbone of infrastructure and economy, there are many up and coming entrepreneurs willing to prove their mettle in the world of business or in government positions. We can pick and chose from the best of them."
  new_expansion_tt:0 "Multiple §YCity Dweller advisors§! become available for service."
  fp_dismantle_old_bunkers:0 "Dismantle the Old Bunkers"
  fp_dismantle_old_bunkers_desc:0 "The Bunkers in which our people survived the Great War have stopped serving their purpose a long time ago. Some were kept around for sentimental reasons, as monuments or simply as warehouses. But we need to look to the future instead of the past and they will serve a way better use as a source of construction material and equipment than dusty mementos of a past long gone."
  fp_new_world_tactics:0 "New World Tactics"
  fp_new_world_tactics_desc:0 "While moving some of the old holotape recorders we found one that had a master reel in it with loads of information about large scale troop warfare, strategies and planning. While a lot has to be adapted to the current state of the world, most of it will be very useful to us."
  fp_old_world_knowledge:0 "Old World Knowledge"
  fp_old_world_knowledge_desc:0 "Amidst boxes with dirty and water stained papers that were entirely useless to us we found a sealed metal box containing solid instructional information about how to build a lot of electronic equipment from scratch. Lucky find."
  fp_weapons_fit_for_the_wastes:0 "Weapons Fit for the Wastes"
  fp_weapons_fit_for_the_wastes_desc:0 "A lot of the more high end weaponry of yesteryear is not sturdy enough to sustain the environment of the wasteland for a longer period of time. We may need to look back to more simpler constructions that are easier to produce and to maintain."
  fp_future_of_war:0 "The Future of War from the Past"
  fp_future_of_war_desc:0 "While simpler weapons may be more reliable, no one can deny the feeling of power you gain by shooting someone in the face with a superheated ball of brightly glowing plasma."
  fp_bunker_research_slot:0 "A Functioning Mainframe"
  fp_bunker_research_slot_desc:0 "Clearly the biggest find we had in the process of dismantling the bunker was that the mainframe installed into it was fully functional, if powered down. If we move all of the important bits to a more accessible place and power it up, this will be a big boon to everything that requires efficient data storage and processing, like our research. There isn't even an evil AI running on it...probably"
  fp_ancestral_ways:0 "Ancestral Ways"
  fp_tools_of_war:0 "Tools of War"
  fp_tools_of_war_desc:0 "One of the benefits of hiring the best and the brightest (or sometimes the most ruthless) is that they sometimes can procure things that you don't really expect. In this case: pre-war weaponry. Fairly advanced one at that too. Something we are rather unlikely to be able to produce ourself."
  fp_tools_of_war_tt:0 "You gain §R10 Mini-Nukes§!"

  fp_clear_rivers:0 "Clear the Riverbanks of Local Fauna"
  fp_clear_rivers_desc:0 "There are many rivers crossing our nations and they play a significant part in our nations economy and infrastructure. But large swathes of them are still plagued by mirelurks and other critters. We need to get rid of them to make work and travel safe for everyone."
  fp_river_commerce:0 "The Rivers of Commerce"
  fp_river_commerce_desc:0 "Fishing and trade along the river was always key to our survival. With the waterways being a lot safer now, we can invest into them more to get the most use out of them."
  fp_river_fleet:0 "Expand our River Fleet"
  fp_river_defense:0 "Defend our Riverbanks"
  fp_river_defense_desc:0 "Rivers have one big disadvantage. We can't really stop other people from using them too. So to prevent someone from just sailing up to a riverside settlement and stealing our stuff and burning it down, we need to build some defences there."
  gpf_coastal_forts_tt:0 "Add multiple §YCoastal Forts§! along your nations rivers."

  fp_help_needed:0 "Help Needed"
  fp_help_needed_desc:0 "While we did manage to clear out the rivers, it was neither quick, nor easy. We lost a good amount of men that didn't stay far enough away from what lurked below the surface. Clearly we were less prepared than we thought. We should look for help."
  fp_foreign_mercenaries:0 "Invite Foreign Mercenaries"
  fp_foreign_mercenaries_desc:0 "The quick way of doing it is spending a good amount of money on getting someone else to do the job for us from now on. There are enough hardy, well equipped folks coming through the area looking for work. Some of them are probably willing to patrol the rivers."
  fp_trained_hunters:0 "Trained Hunters"
  fp_trained_hunters_desc:0 "The way that requires more work is training people specifically for tracking and hunting down all these critters. They may not be ready immediately, but it will pay off in the long run."

  fp_member_tt:0 "§YOriginal Great Plains Federation Members§!"
  fp_has_not_started_joint_focus_tt:0 "No other original §YGreat Plains Federation§! member has started this focus yet."
  fp_the_joint_focus_tt:0 "§gThe corresponding focus will also be completed for the other original members of the§! §YGreat Plains Federation§!.\n\n"
  fp_the_joint_focus_bonus_tt:0 "§gThe nation that completes this focus for all members will also get the following bonus:§!"
  fp_the_joint_focus_bonus_event_tt:0 "§gThe nation that completes this focus for all members will also get a bonus based on the event outcome.§!"
  fp_the_joint_focus_bonus_event_reward_tt:0 "§gBonus for completing the original focus:§!"
  fp_the_join_tech_sharing_tt:0 "Every original §YGreat Plains Federation§! member joins the §YGreat Plains Federation Education System§!"
  fp_buff_first_peoples_federation_sharing:0 "§G10%§! Technology Sharing bonus from §YGreat Plains Federation Education System§!."

  fp_the_alliance:0 "Revisit the Accord of First People's Junction"
  fp_the_alliance_desc:0 "While our nations have worked together for a long time now, large scale cooperative projects were a rare thing. Maybe it's time to change that."
  fp_lacrosse:0 "The Little Brother of War"
  fp_lacrosse_desc:0 "We should consider reviving the old sport called stickball. It was often used to settle disputes between tribes and get young warriors ready for battle. Both of these things sound incredible useful. Add to it the entertainment value and regular inter-federation matches become a very good idea."
  fp_combined_militia_effort:0 "Combined Militia Efforts"
  fp_combined_militia_effort_desc:0 "The defence of the countryside was often left to the individual settlements in the respective area. Which means there were areas were raiders roamed more or less freely. Especially around the region that is considered to be the border between our nations, since everyone just hopes the other one will do the job. This can't go on for longer if we want to succeed in this harsh environment. We need to keep track of what militias and other defensive forces are available in the complete federation and how quick we can send them to where they are needed."
  fp_fortify_the_borders:0 "Fortify the Borders"
  fp_fortify_the_borders_desc:0 "Roaming raider gangs are not the only issue we face. Looming threats are forming on our borders and we need to be prepared. Outposts and some bigger fortification installations at natural choke points will do the job for now."
  fp_shared_education:0 "Schooling for Everyone"
  fp_shared_education_desc:0 "Having a unified federation-wide education system will not only help us combat issues like poor literacy and an untrained workforce, but also will raise a new generation of bright minds that will accelerate our research projects."
  first_peoples_federation_sharing:0 "Great Plains Federation Education System"
  fp_into_the_PIT:0 "Into the PIT"
  fp_into_the_PIT_desc:0 "Our shared education system was a good start, but we need a central place to send our best and brightest people to. The Plains Commonwealth Institute of Technology, colloquially called 'The Pit', was such a place before the war. Maybe we can make it one again. If we manage to clear out all raiders and rad roaches that have claimed it since, that is."
  fp_into_the_PIT_bonus_tt:0 "Additional §Y30 Days§! of §YPreparations for the PIT§!"
  fp_clear_out_PIT_raiders:0 "Clear out the Raiders"
  fp_clear_out_PIT_raiders_desc:0 "A unpleasant fellow calling himself the 'Lord of the Pit' and his gang have made their home in the abandoned PIT. Over the years they remade the former place of learning into a veritable fortress. A joint effort between our nations militaries is necessary to oust him from that place."
  fp_the_archives:0 "Comb the Archives"
  fp_the_archives_desc:0 "Why did the PIT staff decide to store so much data on punch cards? We get the feeling that the PIT was seriously underfunded, if they couldn't even afford at least consumer grade holodisk machines. The punch cards are beyond any attempt to salvage them, but the few holodisks they had luckily survived intact. We should distribute them among the Federation, so they can be used as efficiently as possible."
  fp_usable_equipment:0 "Share the Spoils"
  fp_usable_equipment_desc:0 "We found a couple of prototypes and improved versions of every day use machinery and devices from before the war. While the machines themselves don't work anymore, we did learn some valuable lessons from dismantling and inspecting them."
  fp_reopen_the_PIT:0 "Reopen the PIT"
  fp_reopen_the_PIT_desc:0 "With a great celebration the Plains Commonwealth Institute of Technology was re-opened to the public today. The leaders of the allied nations were all in attendance to applaud this great leap forward for the Federation. The first batch of new students was already waiting in front of the gates, ready to begin learning. The future is within our grasp."

  fp_the_expedition:0 "The Expedition"
  fp_the_expedition_desc:0 "The 'vision' has brought on a flurry of activity. Fortune seekers, Storykeepers and others are interested to see where this vision will lead us. It will take some time to prepare to get everything ready, but ready we will be."
  fp_unknown_woman_appared:0 "Received a mysterious vision"
  fp_expeditions_boon:0 "The Boon"
  fp_expeditions_boon_desc:0 "The expedition was hard and not without it's losses, but we prevailed and we brought something home with us that has not been seen for almost 200 years. Horses. Living, breathing horses, bred specifically to survive in these harsh environments. Long before the war our people adapted so quickly to them to be renown for their skill with horses. We will do so again."
  fp_towards_lonestar:0 "Towards Lone Star"
  fp_outriders:0 "Train the Outriders"
  fp_outriders_desc:0 "One of the advantages of horses is the speed in rough terrain without using up the limited fuel reserves we have left. We should invest into a shared reconnaissance force using horses that uses this to our advantage."
  fp_outriders_tt:0 "Deploys §Y3 Outrider Cavalry§! units in your capital."
  fp_horse_breeding:0 "Planned Horse Breeding"
  fp_horse_breeding_desc:0 "While the initial stock of horses was good, it won't be enough to satisfy the needs of our troops in the long run. We need to organize a system to breed them efficiently or we will run out sooner or later."
  fp_internal_trade:0 "Organized Internal Trade"
  fp_internal_trade_desc:0 "While trade between the areas owned by the different federation members has always been a thing, it was sporadic and not well supervised. With a more structured approach we can guarantee economic growth and prevent or at least mitigate things like local food, resource or equipment shortages."
  fp_free_trade:0 "Free Trade Between Members"
  fp_free_trade_desc:0 "We made great steps in the right direction with our new approach to trade. Now we just need to stop individual settlements 'taxing' traders for protection. Often rather forcefully."
  fp_infrastructure_projects:0 "Infrastructure Projects"
  fp_infrastructure_projects_desc:0 "With an ever increasing influx of people and goods we need to upgrade our transport network. Paths, roads, trains. Everything could need some fixing and a new coat of paint."
  fp_restore_highways:0 "Restore the Highways"
  fp_restore_highways_desc:0 "There are many highways criss-crossing our nations. They are often the most direct paths between cities and minor settlements. Where they are passable that is. We need to check their state of disrepair and send workforces to the worst affected parts of them."
  fp_restore_highways_tt:0 "Every original §YGreat Plains Federation§! member adds §Y3 Infrastructure§! to their capital province."
  fp_connect_settlements:0 "Connect the Smaller Settlements"
  fp_connect_settlements_desc:0 "While repairing the highways is well and good, not every settlement is conveniently placed along those arteries. A lot of smaller communities are often situated off the beaten track. We need to make sure these people don't fall through the grid by having clear, well protected roads to them so traders can reach them and supply them with whatever they may need."
  fp_connect_settlements_tt:0 "Every original §YGreat Plains Federation§! member adds §Y2 Infrastructure§! to a non-capital province."
  fp_reopen_train_stations:0 "Reopen Train Stations"
  fp_reopen_train_stations_desc:0 "The train network has lain idle since the war. While the occasional opportunistic spirit has claimed a train station as his domicile, no work has gone into actually getting the trains and tracks into working condition again. But especially in places where brahmin caravans are at capacity a freight train will both help with the amount of goods and time it takes to deliver them. It will be a significant undertaking, but well worth it."
  fp_passenger_trains:0 "Passenger Trains"
  fp_passenger_trains_desc:0 "A surprising byproduct of our restarted train network is the increasing demand of people wanting to travel with them. But our trains really have no room to host any significant amount of passengers. A big silo wagons full of grain is not a good place to travel. The solution is simple: dedicated passenger train that drive on a fixed schedule. This will cut somewhat into our freight capacity, but has the benefit of being able to send people where there are needed quickly."
  fp_protect_caravans:0 "Protect the Caravans"
  fp_protect_caravans_desc:0 "Our approach of stopping the often protection racket like ways of certain settlements towards traders sadly led to a decrease in protection for caravans overall. It seems we need to step in ourselves. Regular patrols along major trader routes and to trade hubs will show that the caravans are not easy pickings for the common raider."
  fp_attract_foreign_caravan_companies:0 "Attract Foreign Caravan Companies"
  fp_attract_foreign_caravan_companies_desc:0 "Since we have the local side of this trading business figured out fairly well, it might be time to look outward and see what other people are doing. And maybe get one or two of these caravan companies interested in setting up shop inside our borders."
  fp_the_currency_question:0 "The Currency Question"
  fp_the_currency_question_desc:0 "So far our nations have mostly used bottlecaps as a currency, because... nobody actually remembers why we started using them. But it has been like this since shortly after the war. The current situation might not be the best way going forward, though. There is a budding currency backed by Lonestars trading empire to the south. And another one coming in from the west, backed by a considerable military power."
  fp_economic_growth:0 "Economic Growth"
  fp_economic_growth_desc:0 "First Peoples Junction is the place to be to buy and sell all kinds of things. Investing in it's growth as a trade hub will benefit all members of the federation."


  gpf_a_monster_approaches:0 "A Monster Approaches"
  gpf_a_monster_approaches_desc:0 "More and more troubling news are coming our way from the west. Travellers and Refugees tell us a large part of Colorado has fallen under the control of someone called 'the Monster of the East'. And from what it sounds like he is moving in this direction. We need to be prepared."

### Fate of the Federation
  gpf_fate_of_the_federation:0 "Fate of the Federation"
  gpf_fate_of_the_federation_desc:0 "Our nations have grown closer and closer in recent times and we have danced around a particular topic for a while now. Should we jump over our own shadows and become one nation and one people? While it would make us a force to be reckoned with in the area, there are not only upsides to it. Even with our already close cooperation, it will still be a while before the new nation would run as effective as the individual ones. And some might argue that some things that make our people unique will get lost in the shuffle."
  gpf_federation_apart:0 "Apart, but Not Divided"
  gpf_federation_merge:0 "One Nation"
  gpf_federation_merge_desc:0 "The Decision has been made. We are one nation, one people. We will be stronger. We will prevail. We will look forward into the future."
  gpf_a_new_ruling_body:0 "A New Ruling Body"
  gpf_a_new_ruling_body_desc:0 "There were many different groups in the various governments before we merged. In addition to that, while they may not lead the nation any more, the skill and experience of the other two previous leaders is invaluable to our newly formed nation."
  gpf_scientific_advisor:0 "The Sky is the Limit"
  gpf_scientific_advisor_desc:0 "The scientific prowess of the Cherokee is unmatched in the area. And nobody personifies this better than Standhope. A brilliant mind like his should not be wasted."
  gpf_cultural_advisor:0 "Part of History"
  gpf_cultural_advisor_desc:0 "History should never be forgotten. Regardless if it is the history of a place, a person, a thing. Many Choctaw dedicated their life to the act of remembering. Nashoba was at the forefront of this movement for decades. He has become part of the history of the Choctaw itself. And he will be part of the history of this new nation."
  gpf_economic_advisor:0 "More Than Just Gambling"
  gpf_economic_advisor_desc:0 "You don't become the leader of a nation and a successful business empire at once without knowing what you are doing. It's more than just bright lights and the luck of the draw."
  gpf_scientific_advisor_tt:0 "Research Advisor §YStandhope Shadow Mountain§! becomes available for service."
  gpf_cultural_advisor_tt:0 "Cultural Advisor §YNashoba Solomon§! becomes available for service."
  gpf_economic_advisor_tt:0 "Economic Advisor §YLushanya Harjo§! becomes available for service."
  gpf_a_new_capital:0 "A New Capital"
  gpf_a_new_capital_desc:0 "It really isn't necessary to move the seat of our government to a new location. But you can't underestimate the symbolic value of having the center of our newly formed nation where many decades ago we signed the document that led us to this point. We still need to improve some infrastructure and amenities in the area, though."
  gpf_gateway_to_the_plains:0 "Gateway to the Plains Commonwealth"
  gpf_gateway_to_the_plains_desc:0 "Lone Star has long dominated the trade in what used to be the Texas Commonwealth. It is hard to compete with them in their chosen arena. But what we can do is become the gateway, the middleman for trade between Texas and the Plains Commonwealth. Kansas City, the scavenger haven of Great Bend, Junction City. Everyone who wants to trade in that are will have to go through us."
  gpf_the_state_of_sequoyah:0 "The State of Sequoyah"
  gpf_the_state_of_sequoyah_desc:0 "It turns out that when we resettled this area, we more or less claimed all the territories of the State of Sequoyah. A united native American government that was proposed almost 300 years ago, but never came to fruition. Better late than never?"
  gpf_the_state_of_sequoyah_tt:0 "Own all the core territories of the original §YGreat Plains Federation§! members."
