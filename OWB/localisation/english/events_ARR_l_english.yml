They knew only that their village, their people, were dying, and that only the secrets of nearby Vaults could save it.\n\nTheir journey to nearby vaults, which would take them through the likes of Shady Sands, Vault City, and Klamath, was frought with peril.

They found a startling surprise in their ancestor's home, now inhabited by a tribe of intelligent, yet friendly, deathclaws. Far more powerful than the Chosen One or any of their potential companions, and with the Water Chip hidden just behind them, the Chosen One was forced to cooperate, at least to some extent.\n\nOnce inside the vault the Chosen One found a unique status quo. The descendants of those that had stayed in Vault 13 lived in tandem with the deathclaws and had created a thriving society together. Yet what shocked the Chosen One the most was how..."

We didn't realize until the afternoon what we were feeling, and it took until nightfall for us to openly speak it.\n\nThe Chosen One had departed into the wastes.\n\nA number of notes and journals had been left behind, somewhat resembling the memoirs once left by their grandparent. Most of their gear had been taken, along with the old Highwayman they once roamed with. While a time of mourning has been declared decisions now rest solely in the hands of the tribal council. While they will always work together in unison it would be best to select a temporary Council Leader, someone to shepard both our tribe and our Council into this new dawn."

  nf_arroyo.5.d:0 "The kidnapping of the people of Arroyo at the hands of the Enclave meant the death of Hakunin, the tribal healer. Despite their best efforts the tribe spent years fruitlessly searching for a suitable replacement. Hakunin had no pupils and left little behind in terms of medical advice. Although a number of Arroyo tribespeople had some level of medical knowledge none rivaled the old coot's skill and experience.\n\nA lucky break came when traders brought word of an ex-Follower who had taken up residence in the Packers. Set on convincing him to settle in the Arroyo tribe, the Chosen One journeyed south to Happy Camp. Once there the Chosen One found Dimitri, a San Francisco-born doctor. Having split from the Followers due to his willingness to accept violence, Dimitri had wandered north, providing small amounts of aid in return for various payments. He had heard of Arroyo and the Chosen One, but he wasn't certain it was time for him to settle permanently.\n\nKnowing that Arroyo needed his skills, the Chosen One..."

  nf_arroyo.6.d:0 "After the destruction of the Oil Rig by the Chosen One the Vault 13 survivors settled in Arroyo with the tribe. Numerous children were born in the years after, one of which was a young girl named Chitsa. There was a healthy rivalry between the children of the Arroyo tribals and Vault dwellers that defined the early childhood of many of the young children, and Chitsa established herself as the cunning leader behind many of the Vault childrens' sport teams and mock battles.\n\nThe Chosen One noticed her from an early age, and watched her grow from a leader among her peers to a manipulative negotiator, able to steal deals from even the most unwilling traders. Her quick wit and capacity for charisma made a position as tribal negotiator a certainty. Having seen Chitsa grow from a young girl to proud woman gave the Chosen One a sense of pride for the next generation of Arroyo. In particular, they were glad to see..."

  nf_arroyo.7.d:0 "Nagor was the youngest cousin of the Chosen One, yet, despite his strong posture and fit body, shared none of his cousin's bravery. His dog, Smoke, was one of the few friends he had growing up. He was teased constantly for his weakness and timidity but never fought back, although he could have easily knocked cold a number of his tormentors.\n\nBut the Enclave's arrival shattered his desire for a meek life. Those who fought back were killed, and Nagor could only bring himself to watch the massacre. His demeanor changed entirely once in Enclave captivity. He began to steel himself for battle, train incessantly, and provoke his captors as often as he could. The Chosen One barely recognized Nagor when he arrived at the oil rig, their once calm and quiet cousin transformed into an aggressive and fearsome man.\n\nAfter escaping the oil rig and returning to Arroyo Nagor began to return to his old self, but never entirely forgot the man he had briefly become. Nervous and worried, Nagor approached the Chosen One for advice. The Chosen One..."

  nf_arroyo.8.t:0 "Sentence: Max Sec"
  nf_arroyo.8.d:0 "Northern California has changed a lot since the Chosen One's quest. Thirty years ago only the most developed cities, Shady Sands and Vault City, bothered to maintain a permanent jail or police force. In most towns, being caught for theft meant a beating. Anything worse required the application of "shotgun justice".\nThe emergence of Max Sec in California politics has changed this dynamic drastically. Their process is simple but lucrative: caravans are sent to nearby towns or cities, asking for any unwanted criminals. A decent fee is paid to whoever presents a criminal for incarceration, so long as they can show some proof of their guilt. The Max Sec caravan then returns to Medford, bounty in tow, and promptly sets about using their new prisoners for heavy labor. The materials produced from Max Sec can range from rare minerals to rewired circuitry, but largely fall under the general guise of crafted metal components. These materials are then exported to various nations, turning Max Sec a healthy profit.\n\nThis egregious profit is in no small part thanks to the atrocious living conditions present in Max Sec prisons. Prisoners are barely fed enough to stay alive, and even the most hardened criminals face little respite under a Max Sec guard's gaze."

  nf_arroyo.9.t:0 "The Quiet Ones"
  nf_arroyo.9.d:0 "They began as quiet shadows, a presence that regional leaders were only vaguely aware of. A seemingly small group of hunters lived off whatever game they could find in the forests, rarely interacting with nearby settlements. The perception of harmless foresters changed, however, when a trader who'd lost the woodland road witnessed twenty hunters work in unison to bring down three deathclaws in quick succession. The startled trader told his story to the people of Arroyo, a story which soon began to spread like wildfire to nearby towns.\nThe Chosen One had no easy task tracking down the isolationist survivalists but still managed to trace them back to their camp. Initially greeted with suspicion the Chosen One was eventually able to win their trust, or at least subdue their hostility. Assured that these "Packers", as they called themselves, were no threat to Arroyo the Chosen One took time to study their culture and traditions."

Overrun with mirelurks, a perseverant group of survivors had made it their crusade to return to their ancestors' home. When they eventually did, led by an elite fireteam known as the Portmasters, they decided to use their plentiful military experience on foreign shores. Their homeland is a mountainous waste, so instead of farming they ship mercenaries across the west coast, trading guns and lives for food and supplies. Thankfully, they lack the population and desire to expand as an empire and instead view war as a means of sustenance."

  nf_arroyo.11.d:0 "Sulik had traveled across the wasteland with the Chosen One during their quest for the G.E.C.K.. While he has since passed on his son, Avueron, now leads the Umbra tribe. Taught of the wonder of technology and civilization by his father and the Chosen One Avueron has turned his tribe away from their traditional spiritual ways. He has instead opted to encourage discovery and permanent settlement, pioneering Arroyan building techniques for members of his tribe.\nThere's been resistance within the tribe, especially amongst Sulik's generation, but most Umbrans have accepted the changes."

  nf_arroyo.12.t:0 "Arroyan Roads"
  nf_arroyo.12.d:0 "As the G.E.C.K. secured the Arroyan people's survival the Chosen One began to instruct Arroyans to build roads into the wasteland. Constructed quickly to promote a rapid increase in trade, the roads have since begun to fall into disrepair. Already relatively small to begin with the roads have begun to collapse and be overtaken by the passing wilderness. While still serviceable for Arroyo's current level of trade any increase in traders would first require an expansion and repair of the road system.\nChitsa has promised to spearhead the rebuilding efforts, but now faces a choice on how to deal with recruiting the manpower needed for the expansion. The effort is certain to be a net positive economically, but fairer wages could buy the workers' loyalty and a more permanent support of Chitsa among the populace. However, a more brutal oversight of the road building will complete the road faster, whatever many lives it may cost. Or, of course, Chitsa could simply decide to allow the effort to procede as is, with whatever rewards that will bring."

A massive breakout was staged in Medford a number of nights ago, and a sizeable portion of Max Sec's prison population managed to escape into the wastes. The prison's government has obviously attempted to keep this under wraps, but the information our source has gleamed suggests a super mutant named Wiggs, a former member of the Master's army later turned outlaw, led the revolt.\n\nWhile Max Sec security hunts down the escapees our focus must remain on protecting our citizens. Border defenses can only do so much, and it seems that proactive steps may be necessary."

This discord struck a high point this week, when a number of elderly warriors and shamans took up arms in the easternmost Kerby area, driving out the tribal warriors loyal to Avueron.\n\nWhile the situation hasn't escalated to a civil war, the increasing autonomy of the eastern regions, along with Avueron's failure to assert control over them, make the possibility near inevitable. Avueron has contacted the Arroyan Council for support, hoping we will be able to solve the crisis."

Chitsa made subtle contact with the raider and bandit gangs that harassed trades approaching Arroyo from the south and offered them a deal: They'd take their business elsewhere, instead robbing traders traveling north from the Den to Klamath, all in exchange for a hefty yearly sum.\n\nWith one swift blow Chitsa managed to both remove Klamath as a serious trade competitor and help Arroyo prosper. While the deal has been in effect for years, Chitsa has recently reevaluated its stipulations. In a secret letter sent west to Dorris Chitsa explained a new aspect of the contract..."

Our border security engaged a portion of the prisoners in a brief battle, but the majority managed to escape into our territory. Our choices now stem from each of the three leaders' perspective. Dimitri is focused on making something of the wounded officers, while Chitsa has drawn up emergency plans to coordinate the capture of the escaped prisoners.

Still, we think we can offer them a fair deal, at the cost of some of their independence. Becoming our subject would allow them to maintain their simple way of life without fear of invasion.

A leering and massive Super Mutant, Whoz and a number of his fellow muties began to recruit smaller prisoner gangs to their cause. There seemed to be little cause for alarm, as the gang had maintained an isolated camp within nearby forests. Yet, last night Whoz's gang assaulted and annihilated a heavily-fortified Max Sec outpost. As far as we can tell, Whoz's gang shows no signs of stopping, and is slowly making their way towards the main prison structure.

Max Sec's neighbors have responded fearfully, and its former patrons have fled to California and Nevada, seeking shelter from the prison madness.

Any prisoners who surrendered were returned to the harsh labor of Max Sec, but any who resisted were killed without second thought. There are certainly still prisoners who have yet to be recaptured, but the defeat of Whoz marks the end of serious disruption within Max Sec.\n\nStill, this saga has exposed Max Sec's weakness to the Arroyan Council.

  nf_arroyo.27.d:0 "Violent ensembles of murderers and criminals tend to make for poor neighbors. While Whoz has so far been content to loot and burn what remains of Max Sec, no one doubts he'll eventually turn his eyes towards us. As Whoz's abuses mount, it seems clear that war will break out soon. Luckily, the network of influence we've built across Max Sec, as well as the grip we hold over a number of former officials, may still be useful. With enough influence and coercion, we'll be able to bring the remnants of Max Sec's forces across our border, giving us an edge in the coming conflict."
  nf_arroyo.27.a:0 "We have no time to waste. We must strike before he can."

  nf_arroyo.28.d:0 "We've gone and dun it. Now that the warden and hiz lackeys are long gone, we've just gotta deal with Arroyo. We figured it'd end up as an all-out war, but one of their leaders seems to think otherwise. Chitsa, her name was, is offering us some kind of pact. We agree to fight when they want, and they make sure we stay in power. It makes us look a bit weak, but it really doesn't sound too bad. The question is if we'll gain more from fighting, or talking."
  nf_arroyo.28.a:0 "Deal! At least, for now."
  nf_arroyo.28.b:0 "Haha, negotiate? Never!"

  nf_arroyo.29.t:0 "Whoz Accepts"
  nf_arroyo.29.d:0 "Just as Chitsa expected, Whoz accepted the deal. It will remain a secret, at least for now, but Whoz is already using the time to solidify his grip on Max Sec's populace. Whoz is a cruel leader, and many will cast judgment on Arroyo for cooperating with him. Yet, the realities of the situation had forced her hand, and Chitsa's scheming had managed to prevent the outbreak of war."

  nf_arroyo.30.t:0 "Dealing With a Broken Prison"
  nf_arroyo.30.d:0 "Most escapees were killed outright. The ringleaders were mostly captured, and hung from the prison's walls. Whoz is dead, and his gang scattered. Yet, for all of the Max Sec administration's blustering at a return to normalcy, the prison nation has been irreperably scarred by the breakout.\n\nWe've worked steadily throughout the crisis to sway Max Sec's population and elites towards Arroyo, and now is the time to make our move. As outrageous as an invasion might seem, Max Sec is clearly too unsteady to maintain independent. With enough coercion, we might be able to convince the prison to submit peacefully. Or, our influence over the Max Sec population might lead to their citizens abandoning them in droves. Either way, the Arroyan army will march victorious."
  nf_arroyo.30.a:0 "Military subjugation is needed to ensure peace."
  nf_arroyo.30.b:0 "The prison can maintain nominal independence, while we benefit from their labor."
  nf_arroyo.30.c:0 "The prison elites that haven't defected to us already stand no chance against our army."

  nf_arroyo.31.t:0 "Brick By Brick"
  nf_arroyo.31.d:0 "Admittedly, the old world was to thank for part of its splendor. While the brahmin barons had invested heavily into its security, much of the prison stood from two hundred years ago, when people not unlike the barons had built it for a similar purpose.\n\nWhile the Arroyan army pushed the Max Sec defenders back to the prison's walls, they were careful not to lay siege to the prison itself. Both sides wished to avoid a second breakout, and so Max Sec surrendered soon after their defeat became apparent. Now, the Arroyan council was forced to reckon with the prisoners.\n\nIt seemed logical to simply place the prison under management and continue its function. It had proved a strong economic backbone for Max Sec, and the fear of breakout seemed far less likely while the prison benefited Arroyo. The risk was nevertheless present however. It seemed to many that the prison could simply be shut down, with the prisoners either executed or returned to their communities."
  nf_arroyo.31.a:0 "The benefits outweight the risk. Send the prisoners to work."
  nf_arroyo.31.b:0 "That kind of thinking is what caused the breakout."

  nf_arroyo.32.t:0 "The Second Max Sec Breakout"
  nf_arroyo.32.d:0 "History repeats itself.\n\nIn the dead of night, a number of Max Sec prisoners staged a daring escape. Using sticks of dynamite and stolen rifles, they burst through one of the prison's gates, spewing out into the night. The clean-up operation is already underway, but this fiasco leaves a sour taste in the mouth of those who suffered at these prisoners' hands half a year ago. Protests and riots have already broken out, even in Arroyo itself, over the mishandling of the prison. Even after the prisoners are rounded back up, it's clear to most that the Max Sec experiment is over."

  nf_arroyo.33.t:0 "Avueron's Plea"
  nf_arroyo.33.d:0 "The loss of control in Kerby forced Avueron to turn to the Arroyan Council for help. He was hesitant at first, fearing that the Chosen One's departure may have signaled an isolationist growth within the tribe. His fears were subdued by the Council itself, however.\n\nChitsa, Dimitri, and Nagor all vowed to support Avueron's desire to industrialize against any dissenters from the tribe. Of the three, Nagor was the most passionate, exclaiming that Arroyo and Umbra would share the same bond that Sulik and the Chosen One once did. Dimitri recognized the importance of Avueron's work, especially his efforts to create more formalized clinics and medical training. Chitsa agreed with the other two, but kept a sly look about her throughout the Council session. After a brief discussion, the Council broke for the evening."
  nf_arroyo.33.a:0 "Of course we will be there!"

  nf_arroyo.34.t:0 "Chitsa's Plan"
  nf_arroyo.34.d:0 "Chitsa was the first to meet with Avueron after the council ended. Her idea was rather simple: Umbra would allow Nagor and the Arroyan military to establish permanent bases across their territory. While this would give Arroyo a stronger grip over Umbra, the advantage to Avueron was clear. Still, Chitsa worried that it might be too up front. If Avueron grew resistant too quickly, any future deals would be far harder to agree upon."
  nf_arroyo.34.a:0 "Despite her concerns, Chitsa suggested the plan."

  nf_arroyo.35.b:0 "Avueron staunchly denied her request."

  nf_arroyo.36.t:0 "Dimitri's Options"
  nf_arroyo.36.d:0 "Avueron was surprised by Dimitri's proposal. Instead of a violent confrontation with the traditionalists, Dimitri advocated for an education campaign among Umbra's population. While any hardline tribals would oppose the idea, he figured that most people would be receptive to it. And, so long as it was able to reach Umbra's populace, whether or not tribal leaders directly approved modernization would matter little. If the majority of the population, especially the young, were educated, technology and industry would be impossible to keep out."
  nf_arroyo.36.a:0 "That's the plan."
  nf_arroyo.36.b:0 "No, we need to show force."

  nf_arroyo.37.t:0 "The Rise of Rain Gambling"
  nf_arroyo.37.d:0 "Corn has been a staple crop of Arroyo since the Chosen One's early days. While Arroyan farmers long sought to only maintain sustainability, an increase in soil fertility and farming advancements has led to a massive boom. In recent years, Arroyo has even begun to export the crop, inviting external revenue from outside sources. However, success breeds speculation, and rain gambling has taken ahold of many Arroyan villagers.\n\nThe premise is rather simple. A person or small group, known as arbiters, run bars in the community. Community members arrive at the arbiter's bar, and individually purchase 'betting cards.' Each card contains a small range of expected total rainfall, with each range having a limited number of cards. Community members may buy betting cards off each other, sometimes leading to massive bid wars for particularly valuable ranges. At the end of the season, profits are distributed using the total in the betting pool, with the arbiters taking their cut.\n\nThe swell of rain gambling bars in the recent months has worried Dimitri. He has little problem with harmless gambling, but the value of the betting cards has led to a slew of robberies and thefts. Dimitri's education has made him aware of the dangers of gambling, further increasing his desire to crack down. Yet, rain gambling does seem to have become a staple of Arroyan village life, and any attempts to limit it might provoke backlash from the farmers."
  nf_arroyo.37.a:0 "Confiscate the bars and betting pools."
  nf_arroyo.37.b:0 "Tax the betting cards."
  nf_arroyo.37.c:0 "It's probably fine as is."

  nf_arroyo.38.t:0 "A Show of Will"
  nf_arroyo.38.d:0 "These old-timers were working to undo everything that the Chosen One and Sulik had worked towards. Not only was it a spat in the face of the ancestors they claimed to care so much about, it was an affront to the Chosen One themselves. Nagor would not allow this to stand. Not now, not ever. He could work with Avueron, but it might even be better to attack the enemy directly, despite what Avueron might think."
  nf_arroyo.38.a:0 "His rage consuming him, sabotage was ordered."

  nf_arroyo.41.t:0 "Grampa Figleef Presents Demands"
  nf_arroyo.41.d:0 "While the anti-modernization movement in the eastern regions of Umbra has so far been largely leaderless, one elder has begun to emerge as a de facto head of the movement. Grampa Figleef, and elder dating from Sulik's era, has presented a list of ten demands to Avueron and the other members of the tribal council. These demands include the resignation of Avueron as tribal elder, permanent rejection of industrialization, and greater autonomy for the eastern regions. While Avueron has been willing to concede on some points, he has refused the majority of them. Grampa Figleef, in turn, now falls under the banner of the tribe of Eastern Umbra, an autonomous part of the Umbra tribe."
  nf_arroyo.41.a:0 "Send more supplies to Avueron. He'll need our help."
  nf_arroyo.41.b:0 "Increase our border presence and watch. Closely."

  nf_arroyo.42.t:0 "Avueron Prepares For War"
  nf_arroyo.42.d:0 "Grampa Figleef's declaration clarified the situation. Avueron knew that he had mere weeks until the eastern tribesmen entered into open rebellion. Disheartened that peace no longer seemed to be an option, Avueron begrudgingly contacted the Arroyo Council again. Aware that war was now inevitable, Nagor's military had two options. They could either deploy with the Umbran forces, working together in joint maneuvers, or conduct their own drills on Eastern Umbra's northern border, threatening a pincer attack."
  nf_arroyo.42.a:0 "A joint plan was the most logical route."
  nf_arroyo.42.b:0 "Arroyo must be able to stand on its own."

  nf_arroyo.43.t:0 "The First Strike"
  nf_arroyo.43.d:0 "With war now on the horizon, the members of the Arroyan council needed to decide how to begin the war. The simplest option would be to wait for an enemy attack, and respond in kind. While this would provide a clear justification for the conflict, they feared that such an attack might catch them off-guard, giving the rebel forces the upper hand in the conflict's opening stages. A preemptive attack could be launched, but it would be difficult to explain to Avueron, who still hoped for a peaceful resolution. There was a third option as well. If a rebel attack were to be fabricated, or provoked in a key location, the war could be framed as a defensive struggle while still retaining the initiative in battle."
  nf_arroyo.43.da:0 "Spend this time stocking emergency supplies."
  nf_arroyo.43.db:0 "A precise strike against their commanders would go well."

He had known from the outset that this was a possibility, but stubbornly believed that he could make his people see reason.\n\nHe had failed.\n\nGrampa Figleef's warriors have swarmed across the border, demanding the return of the Grampy Bone as a symbol of tribal leadership, the death of Avueron, and the rejection of modernization. Arroyo, honoring their pledge to Avueron, has intervened on Umbra's behalf. War has come to Umbra."

The remaining warriors surrendered to the combined Umbra-Arroyan forces today. Grampa Figleef has fled across the Packers' border, and the now leaderless traditionalists have realized they have no path to victory. All that remains is to set out a new path for the eastern area of Umbra. The ties forged between Umbra and Arroyo have permanently placed the tribe under Arroyo's wing, meaning the decision lies in the hands of the council. The state could see its forest cleared to accomodate new industry, but it might benefit Arroyo more to see it used as a supply path for any future southern conflicts."

  nf_arroyo.46.t:0 "A Boy and His Dog"
  nf_arroyo.46.d:0 "Sometimes, people thought it was a bit odd that Nagor always named his dog Smoke. To most, it wasn't a concern. Nagor clearly loved Smoke, even if the name Smoke could refer to a dog from any number of different generations. Chitsa, and a few others, whispered that it was related to some childhood trauma, as if he was trying to make up for what had happened to his first dog.\n\nIn truth, that type of thinking wasn't fair to Nagor. To him, Smoke wasn't the... 4th? 5th? different dog he's kept throughout his life. Smoke was one consciousness, passed down from generation to generation. That was why every time Smoke grew old, or got wounded while hunting, or was exposed to too much radiation, Nagor never despaired. He was sad, to be sure, since he could see that Smoke was clearly in a lot of pain. But he always knew that he'd find Smoke again soon.\n\nThe only thing Nagor truly feared was how he would find Smoke when his turn came."

If it wasn't, she truly had no excuse for the amount of time she'd spent with that idiot.\n\nThey had been introduced to each other as first or second cousins. At the time, Nadia's parents had left the vault, and Nadia needed a new family to live with. A few years later, Chitsa would learn about what Vault Security had found buried underneath Nadia's parents' floorboards. But she had been preoccupied with more pressing matters when she met Nadia: namely, how completely idiotic she was. Chitsa didn't mind calling people stupid, but Nadia was truly, deeply, amazingly, stupid. It wasn't even that she was dim-witted, like Nagor, or lacked common sense, like Dimtri. Nadia was just an idiot.\n\nAt first, Chitsa cursed her misfortune. It was just her luck to be forced to make friends with an imbecile. Yet, the more Chitsa thought on it, the more she began to believe that Nadia might be a blessing in disguise. Thing is, everyone knew Nadia was stupid. Few people liked her anyways. It was pretty easy to, when needed, blame everything on Nadia. She wasn't thrilled with that, obviously, but she knew better than to challenge Chitsa, the only person who at least put on the facade of being her friend.\n\nActually, it had been a while since Chitsa had seen Nadia.

Just experienced enough to take the lead on prescribing a treatment, while far too novice to see a patient alone.\n\nThe patient told Dimitri that he had been beaten by a gang of thugs in an alley near his home. Shocked, Dimitri and his supervisor saw to the man's wounds, gave him pain medication, and sent him home. Dimitri, however, was outraged. While he wished to immediately report the attack, his supervisor dissuaded him, arguing that Dimitri's job was to treat the patient. Justice was another man's duty.\n\nEven all these years later, thinking of that response infuriated Dimitri. How did that make any sense? How could someone be blind enough to simply rely on others to do the right thing? Isn't that attitude only treating the symptom, rather than the cause?\n\nHe knew that not every Follower thought like his supervisor. Still, that day had shaken his faith in the organization that had trained him, setting him on his present course.\n\nThe holier than thou attitude of the Followers might be their downfall, but he wouldn't let it be his."

While he's the first we've seen of this type of doomsday preacher, we doubt he's alone. On one hand, it would be a sound plan to make an example out of him. The doctrine he preaches is no doubt what caused the Packer warriors to begin raiding our territory. However, a less threatening approach is warranted as well.

This victory is more than hollow, considering that we had not desire for this war to begin in the first place. We already know that fully retreating from this territory isn't a realistic option. The Packers' warriors have either been slain or surrendered, but retreating now would only allow them to prepare for a potential second attack. The warriors we have captured have been mysteriously silent on what caused the attack, as have the civilians questioned in the encampments we've uncovered. \n\nIf we are to prevent a second Packer attack and avoid an even greater conflict, an investigation into the Packer society is a necessity. \n\nBecause in the darkest part of the Council members' hearts, they know that they could just kill them all."

Whatever progress we made seems to have fallen short of fulling understanding and stopping the outbreak of a second war. \n\nOur one small comfort is that this conflict will be lamentably one-sided. Their most experienced warriors were killed in the first war, and our mapping of the Packers' forest home has reduced the advantage they once held. While this may end up only acting as a setback for Arroyo, it will most likely permanently cripple the Packer tribes."
  nf_arroyo.53.db:0 "The news from the Packers' former territory has been increasingly hopeful over the past few weeks. The mistrust of the populace has begun to ebb away, slowly being replaced with an uneasy acceptance of our soldiers and doctors. Our diplomatic overtures to tribal leaders have born even more fruit.

If we wished to prevent a second war, we had no choice but to make the Packer tribes unable to wage it. That meant killing. Killing until they fled.

Instead, Chitsa might be able to convince him to focus entirely on his military leadership. While this ran certain risks, it would get him out of her way, at least in the short term.

Our investigators originally theorized that their inattention was a trained defense mechanism, taught to make them resistant to torture. However, after we managed to communicate with the prisoners we learned that their perception of the situation couldn't be further from reality.\n\nThese warriors have been brainwashed to believe that surrendering to an enemy is sacrilege, and that any who do so will be punished by the Packers' forest spirits. This is tribalistic nonsense, but these lies seem to have a tight hold on most Packer warriors. It seems that a group of druids are the source of this fanaticism. We will investigate the matter further."

  nf_arroyo.61.d:0 "The native Packers will barely speak to our garrison, let alone give them the information we need. These groups were already extremely tight-knit, and the devastation brought to their home has only made them more reclusive. Most carry small totems and trinkets around with them and spend their time either hunting and gathering or attending to their woodland homes. Our search for information in these communities must answer a few key questions. We still don't have a clear picture of what led to their attack, or an explanation for the flames that were sighted that same morning. In a situation as complex as this, there are a number of ways to approach the issue."

So why, our people wonder, do we keep expanding?\n\nThe reasons were clear at first. Our allies needed help. Since then, things have become less clear. Every day it becomes harder to justify our expansion and wars, but each day also brings more of it, trapping us in a spiral of increasing involvement outside our tribal home."
  nf_arroyo.62.a:0 "There is nothing to be done."

  nf_arroyo.63.t:0 "Uncovering the Truth"
  nf_arroyo.63.d:0 "It was no easy task, but we did manage to fully uncover the truth of the Packers' society. Their seemingly harmless semi-nomadic communities were in truth overseen by an elite ring of druids. These druids oversaw a woodland religion that came to infiltrate almost every aspect of Packer life, turning a naturally reclusive people into religious fanatics. Their tribal religion obstensibly promoted a strong respect for nature, but in reality was used by the druidic elites to accumulate power.\n\nGrampa Figleef's arrival marked a shift in their goals. He was already close with many of them, and slowly managed to convince the inner circle that Arroyo posed a serious danger to their power. So, the night before the attack, a small group began a fire that quickly spread through the north of [182.GetName]. The inner circle issued a unanimous proclamation in the hours after: Arroyo was responsible. From there, the rest is history."
  nf_arroyo.63.a:0 "Who knew..."

  nf_arroyo.64.t:0 "Dimtri's Device"
  nf_arroyo.64.da:0 "Dimitri smiled and lightly juggled the cold metal box. To the uninitiated, it appeared to be nothing more than some odd contraption, marked by buttons and dials on its surface. To Dimitri, however, this piece of metal was the culmination of years work. He had originally come across the idea during his time spent in Happy Camp, with the Packers. It had been a hobby of his since then, tuning, fiddling, and tampering both with the device and, by extension, the environment around it.\n\nGiven the present circumstances, he now hoped to use the device on the land which had birthed it. The forest fire had scarred much of northern [182.GetName], and the wanton destruction had affected the Packers' psyche. Using the device to help regrow the forest could be seen as a useful gesture of good faith, creating trust between the wary people and Arroyo. The device was also fully modular, meaning that it could be used as a punishment, of sorts. Tuned correctly, it could cause a destructive level of growth, overruning settlements and perhaps even killing the slow or unlucky."
  nf_arroyo.64.db:0 "The device was interesting, if obfuscating. Left behind by the good doctor, its mechanisms and traps are betrayed by its simple exterior. A test run conducted by a few Arroyan scientists led to its hasty disassembly, as its activation almost immediately led to vines and roots sprouting out from the ground around it. What could the purpose of this contraption be?"

  nf_arroyo.65.d:0 "New Reno tourists have found a new oddity in the past few weeks. An older man calling himself Grampa Figleef, dressed in tribal garb and decorated by string laced bones, has taken a street corner near the center of the city. Rambling and raving about the degeneracies of civilization, the old man occasionally draws a small crowd of entertained listeners.\n\nUntil, one day, a junkie finds him laying on a heap of garbage, blood trickling from under his ragged shirt."
  nf_arroyo.65.a:0 "And?"

  nf_arroyo.66.t:0 "Outcast Once More"
  nf_arroyo.66.d:0 "Nagor had always distrusted outsiders. So why had he allowed for Dimitri's place on the Council? He should have known better, allowing a man from so far to the south into Arroyo's top ranks. No matter what he said or did, it was clear that he couldn't be trusted. Something had to be done. Dimitri may be well-liked, but few would truly stand up to his enforced exile. Besides, Nagor controlled the military. A visit to Dimitri's home, with appropriate force, would make his options clear to him."
