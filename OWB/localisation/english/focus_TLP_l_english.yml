That he was given a un-life for a purpose, rather than this being fate’s way of punishing him for a crime unjust.\n\n“The Last Patrol”, to many of the Ghouls of Oklahoma is that purpose. Harrison knows how hard it is to hold onto just “himself” - what of others, who lived hard lives that were “worth” forgetting, lives where an eternal existence is actually true punishment? They had no hope of holding onto themselves, of not falling into the mind of a beast and forgetting what it's like to be human.\n\nHarrison’s Patrol is how he would keep these ghouls from forgetting themselves, to give them a life they can be proud of."

The “Possessed” army of the Chapel. Across the Cimarron River an army of addled tribals gather in preparation for a crossing, to attack where the Last Patrol is currently camped.\n\nSomething is keeping these tribesmen enslaved - a cage of the mind.

To set up a true and proud election - move away from the dictatorships of the wastelands and back to something that the people could be proud of.\nThis “First General Election”, after it was planned and organized, would go rather smoothly. Voters from the formally conquered cities and tribes moved into “Ballot Boxes” - often being escorted out of their homes at gunpoint if they weren’t patriotic enough to assist in the building of the new nation.\nHarrison expected this to go amazing for him, for the people to accept his leadership with open arms.. It seems, instead, that the opposite has happened! Rival candidates have overtaken early results with overwhelming odds. By this point Harrison doesn’t have much he can do but either try to steal the election through ballot box manipulation - or through backing another candidate."
