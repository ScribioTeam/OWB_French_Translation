  TOC_theodore_price_economic_advisor_desc:0 " Before the war, Price worked for the Northwest Commonwealth Electrical Concern. Their main goal was to fuel the infrastructure hub linking the United States and the recently annexed Canada. After the war, most of the plants were nothing more than a relic of the Old World, no fossil fuels left to burn in the rampant wastes. A single nuclear plant in Electric City operated, and Price aims to keep it running. Being almost as old as he was and still working to keep the lights on, he views the plant as a kindred spirit of sorts; A tether to a past that can't be broken just yet."

What he found was more of the same, another place where his skin was a death warrant to some people. Arming himself and any other ghouls to the teeth, he is determined to spite all the bigots in Coure d'Alene simply by surviving."
