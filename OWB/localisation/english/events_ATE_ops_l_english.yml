  ate_ops.1.t:0 "The Story of the Aztlan Operative"
  ate_ops.1.d:0 "There’s a campfire story often told amongst Itzans (and the more daring of our slaves) about an Aztlan operative’s attempts to assassinate an Itzan general. \n \n “One day, a member of La Fuerza decided to kill one of the Itzan generals. He travelled to Itza, found his home, and spent a week scoping it out. He surveyed every possible escape route, studied the general’s security, and learned his routine adamantly. After all this, he contacted his boss, and told him all he would need to carry out the assassination is a tiny pistol. 'Really?' His boss asked, astonished. Nevertheless, the agent assured him that it would be more than enough. He had learned everything there was to know about the general, there was certainly no way for him to fail. \n \n Finally, the agent approached the general just outside his home. 'General! General!' He said, shouting and waving his arms, 'I come to challenge you to honorable single combat, in the name of Nueva Aztlan!' \n \n Needless to say, the guards made short work of him after that.”"

  ate_ops.2.d:0 "                       ***BULLETIN, FROM OUR GREAT LEADERS*** \n \nCitizens, our enemies lurk on every corner! The Kalomte, their armies, and their spies, all seek to destroy us! In order to defeat this menace on our border we need only to work together against them! All that requires is that you not trust your neighbors, and watch their every move! The Itzan have laid spies throughout our territory, hoping to find weak minds that can fall prey to their propaganda and lies, and only neighborhood vigilance can stop them! \n \nWhatever happens, remember: an Itzan sympathizer is an Itzan in disguise!"

  ate_ops.3.t:0 "A Night in Yucatan"
  ate_ops.3.d:0 "Jungo moved quietly through the town’s streets. He had met his contact and given him his orders. All that was left was to leave town, and the sooner the better. Lost in thought, he walked confidently down a smaller street. The trick was, of course, to act confident. A guard might harass a suspicious looking man slinking through the town in the dead of night. A proud, marching man, however, would attract only respect and the tip of a hat.  \n \n    The side alley he had chosen brought him close to the slave pens. A mistake. \n \n    “Senor, senor!” A slave shouted from one of the cages. He was gesturing wildly, looking for any spare crumbs. \n \n    Jungo sped up, turning his walk into a brisk pace. He had just barely managed to turn the corner when he heard a guard exit the nearby barracks and make his way over to the slave. Quietly releasing his breath, he slowed down his walk again. The less attention, the better."
  ate_ops.3.a:0 "A close call, for sure."

  ate_ops.4.t:0 "To Win a War"
  ate_ops.4.d:0 "General Gabriel Fraga often wondered why he ever accepted such a title. If he had been told twenty years ago that the reward for slowly advancing through the military ranks of the Aztlan was spending long nights staring at maps and reports, well, the prospect of becoming a career officer would have been far less convincing. \n \nThe only thing salvaging his mood was the contents of the various reports scattered across his desk. It seemed that, if only for the time being, Itza was on the backfoot. La Fuerza had held their own against the I.C.D.E.B., and even scored some operational victories. The consistent intelligence failures of the Aztlan had pained Fraga for years. He never felt like he could lead his troops with confidence, always afraid of Itzan ambushes or surprise offensives. Until now, he had been fumbling in the dark against an enemy he seemed to know nothing about. If, just maybe, that could change... \n \nWell, then this would be a whole different war."

  ate_ops.5.d:0 "Those present would remember this meeting for the rest of their lives. Seated around a stone table, an old ghoul wearing a dapper suit and tie gave them the news. \n \n”Full funding has been authorized for La Fuerza Especial,” he stated bluntly, speaking quietly and slowly. “From now on, the resources you request will be the resources given to you.” \n \nThey glanced at each other quickly, unsure of what they were hearing. Surely, there was a catch? \n \n”You will understand, then, that the best of results are expected from you. Given your performance, however, we aren’t worried,” the ghoul said, slowly rising from his seat at the table. “My name is Langley, and you’ll be hearing from me quite a bit.”"
