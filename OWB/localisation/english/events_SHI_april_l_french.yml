 nf_shi_april.1.t:0 "A Sunny Day in San Francisco"
 nf_shi_april.1.d:0 "It was a warm spring day when King Norton awoke to glorious reports! The American Union State pushed back to the edges of Denver, peace with Canada granting us the newly minted Californian Columbia, and Mexico's last pocket of resistance has been crushed. \n\nSilly reports of Republican terrorists and weapons of mass destruction will not ruin the news, nor will the news of toxic gas attacks in San Diego, or uh... the Royal Guards running around the courtyard below his majesty's window, or the..... the bright flash in The Bay. \n\nOne moment later melting glass shards were flying at King Norton and the next him and his palace were in a new strange world...."
 nf_shi_april.1.a:0 "A what crashed on the Steel Palace?!"
 nf_shi_april.2.t:0 "The Devil Behind the Eyes"
 nf_shi_april.2.d:0 "Weeks I spend on the drowning boredom of day to day life. Then I suddenly awaken, to find that weeks and months of my life were all imaginary. But it's not the end, not until I spot the hate filled, donkey faced, man of shadows who, upon being spotted paralyzes me as creatures crawl over my pockmarked skin. For hours this continues until I awaken for the final time, my only solace being the safety in the day until my next rest, and with it, my next possibility of seeing him. "
 nf_shi_april.2.a:0 "How long until he visits again..."
 nf_shi_april.3.t:0 "Eternity sounds like Hell"
 nf_shi_april.3.d:0 "Again I was visited by the large man with the crowns. He told me stories of hippos, illiteracy, and rotting corpses in a swamp. What he wants I have no way of knowing. All thats certain is he will appear again and he will flood my memories with his words.""
 nf_shi_april.3.a:0 "What being cursed me to be his ghoulish muse?"
 nf_shi_april.4.t:0 "Tiny hit, to remind you im still watching"
 nf_shi_april.4.d:0 "As I sit on the street and watch my palace burn and riches get plundered, I smile. This vision guarantees being visited by my favorite of the spectres that haunt me. He too is caught in a world that isn't for him. There is no employing class for him to wage a war against, no workers toil being stolen. \n\nWe sit and watch the flames, occainsionally brushing an ember off or sharing an anecdotal story. But otherwise it's silent. "
 nf_shi_april.4.a:0 "I wonder if he too is stuck in this world."
 nf_shi_april.5.t:0 "The King is Down with the Sickness"
 nf_shi_april.5.d:0 "The King hasn't taken the acclimitization to the increased Radiation well. He's been throwing up and sickly all week, this, along with his frequent nightmares and migraines, have made him sickly and deteriorated."
 nf_shi_april.5.a:0 "We can only pray his body recovers from the rads."
 nf_shi_april.6.t:0 "The Pantheon of America"
 nf_shi_april.6.d:0 "The King awoke in a panic from another nightmare. He dreamed his skin was peeling and people on the street stared, pointed, and hurled insults at him. \n\nHe turned to his lamp only to find the torso of an obtuse man, dozens of crowns cradled in his arms. Scrambling off the bed, calling for a guard, he peak over the side of the side of the bed to see the man gone. This is the first time and it won't be the last. His dreams are frequently visited by the same 3 spectres. The man with the crowns, who shows visions of my Royal Treasury's being looted by mobs of angry, starving men. A second Big man, his left eye blinded and his hands blistered and bruised from years of toil, he haunts me with dreams of ghouls and mechanical men abused and hunted across the wasteland. And lastly a wirey, angry man who's eyes are empty to the back, replaced instead by rage and hatred. \n\nThey are the remnants of my America, the America I was stolen from to be taken here."
 nf_shi_april.6.a:0 "Every night I pray this is all a dream and not purgatory for some cosmic sin I've levied against a vengeful god."
 nf_shi_april.7.t:0 "Lawlessness in the Streets of San Francisco"
 nf_shi_april.7.d:0 "I found myself strolling through the streets of San Francisco when me and my entourage were ambushed by Shi Loyalists and Hubologists. Although they fought valiantly the Royal Guard were no match for the laser and gamma weapons of the attackers. Caught in the crossfire of the gamma weapons caused me to pass out. Upon awaking I was in a warehouse full of toxic sludge and radiation barrels. Surrounded by Hubologists and facing a man melted into the concrete, what remains of his body indistinguishable from the sludge leaking from the barrels flanking him. Slowly, a priests of the Hubologists tipped my chair towards the man, now screaming. The heat burning my throat and drying out my eyes. The radiation being caked into my face, cancerous blots being grown and killed leaving my skin pocked and shallow. The moments of torture being dragged into eternity finally broken by my guards breaking into the warehouse and killing the priests."
 nf_shi_april.7.a:0 "My nightmares have been realised..."
 nf_shi_april.8.t:0 "Answers to my Riddles Three"
 nf_shi_april.8.d:0 "Norton ascended a frozen mountain in search of a Boss renowned by the world. Atop the snowy cliffs stood a cave, lit by a campfire, it's flames illuminating a drawn storybook of the history of the Boss. Norton bowed beneath the three cloaked figures, the three people who can help make sense of his night-terrors. \n\nThe Shortest one carried a torch who's flamed was fed by a propane tank. \n\n The Second shortest held onto a ring of keys who's locks have been lost to time. \n\nAnd the Least Shortest carried a double barrel shotgun, with a barrel covered in flame decals which have been frozen over by freezer-burn. \n\nWithout a word the Least Shortest fed the flames a powder which caused billowing smoke to fill the room and escape the cave. In the smoke was a figure with a backdrop of the Phoenix Flag. His words to Norton were simple "You have won the game set upon you. Screenshot what you see and ping me on discord with @SGucciG. At the time of this content being released I may go by SOctaG." with a pause he continued "Norton, your mission in this world is complete. You have the choice, have your mind return back to your world, where civil war rampages the corpse of America, or stay here, with your charred face and attempt to forge a future for the people of this world.""
 nf_shi_april.8.a:0 "Goi-King! Send me home! This world is no place for a man of my accoutrement!"
 nf_shi_april.8.b:0 "This world needs me. And..... I need it."
 nf_shi_april.9.t:0 "Oh yeah.... The flash"
 nf_shi_april.9.d:0 "And with a flash he sent me back. It's been so long that I nearly forgot the flash. Shards of glass pierced my eyes and punctured my skull. The world I spent so long in was only the after-shock from this blast. But now I know it first hand."
 nf_shi_april.9.a:0 "I wonder, will either of my Kingdoms survive?"
 nf_shi_april.10.t:0 "An Autodoc for your Time?"
 nf_shi_april.10.d:0 "I approach the last shining beacon of technology in the wasteland searching for one simple thing, a cure. The final blow to my ailments rest in a Mormon Fort, and behind a lonel man who just wants my company."
 nf_shi_april.10.a:0 "A nickle for your thoughts Dr. Gannon?"
 nf_shi_april.10.b:0 "No way in hell do I want their 'cure'. I want answers dammit!"
 nf_shi_april.10.c:0 "I like the way this guy thinks. He can certainly help me on my quest!"
