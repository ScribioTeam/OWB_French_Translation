  nf_tim.1.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] seeks our help?"
  nf_tim.1.d:0 "It seems that [FROM.GetName] wants our help in abandoning cannibalism, if we listen to them we might be able to aid in their efforts. Otherwise? We can always leave them be as they are now if we feel they don't deserve the aid."
  nf_tim.1.a:0 "We always help the needy"
  nf_tim.1.b:0 "Never!"
  nf_tim.2.t:0 "The Timberline help us!"
  nf_tim.2.d:0 "A few support caravans have already made their way into our territory from the Timberline, them seeming to have agreed to our request!"
  nf_tim.2.a:0 "Great."
  nf_tim.3.t:0 "They refuse!"
  nf_tim.3.d:0 "The Timberline seem to think we are being aggressive?"
  nf_tim.3.a:0 "I mean, they aren't wrong."
  nf_tim.8.t:0 "The Rabid Barbarian Squirrels"
  nf_tim.8.desc:0 "A particularly rambunctious but gifted group of our rangers - using an ancient patrol name passed down from before the war - seems hellbent on saving [YAK.GetNameDef] from [WBH.GetNameDef]. Completely ignoring the risk that such direct intervention poses to themselves - and to their fellow countrymen, should they incur the wrath of [WBH.GetNameDef] - they've already boarded a ragtag fleet of boats headed for [65.GetName], geared up with our finest ranger equipment. Let's hope that the RBS can make an impact, and that they don't cause too much trouble for [YAK.GetNameDef] in the meantime..."
  nf_tim.8.a:0 "Too late to stop them now..."
  nf_tim.9.t:0 "Timberline Volunteers Arrive!"
  nf_tim.9.desc:0 "A peculiar group of soldiers from [TIM.GetNameDef] have joined our struggle against [WBH.GetNameDef], and brought a small stockpile of ranger equipment. Knowledge of foreign support for our war effort has bolstered morale, and our engineers have been able to learn much from their specialised equipment."
  nf_tim.9.a:0 "We will never forget this."
