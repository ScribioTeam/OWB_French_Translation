  veg_judgement_desc:0 "In 2065, House predicted that a nuclear exchange between the US and China would take place within the next 15 years, and decided to put all of his resources into protecting his home city of Las Vegas. He had his own hotel, the Lucky 38 Casino, fitted with radar-jamming systems, missile arrays, a laser defence network, and life-support systems."

  veg_software:0 "Incomplete OS"
  veg_software_desc:0 "Following the valiant defence of New Vegas, house was thrown into a violent coma, and the majority of his data and robots found themselves corrupted and inoperable for the following decades, silent protectors incapable of movement or thought. When House returned to consciousness, he had choices to make. Did he dare attempt to salvage his more advanced OS or did he simply fall back on a stable version?"

  veg_families:0 "Three Families"
  veg_families_desc:0 "House hopes to rebuild the world, and to do so he has to start by rebuilding his beloved Vegas. He begins with the 3 great Casinos that once rivalled his own lucky 38, going out to find groups suitable for such establishments, those who can be easily controlled, and bring Vegas the moxie it's going to need in the future."

  veg_newvegas:0 "New Vegas"
  veg_newvegas_desc:0 "The process of rebuilding Vegas didn't happen quickly, and between spending money hunting for his precious platinum chip and micromanaging the families of the strip, House has found himself more than occupied. Despite this, he did find the time and money to invest in Vegas itself."

  veg_oldauthority:0 "Old Authority"
  veg_oldauthority_desc:0 "Long ago? I ruled Vegas with my machines and my wealth. There were none in this city who could stand against me, and now? More than ever? That is true. They shall again learn to respect the name Robert House. My authority must be absolute if I am to save this world from the mess it has become."

  veg_house:0 "The House"
  veg_house_desc:0 "Vegas, or as they are now calling it, New Vegas, has been my home for so long as I can remember. It has been my home, my house, and it shall be the house from which the rest of the Wasteland is taught the lessons of old. My well laid plans are older than any can imagine, I can't allow myself to fail."

  veg_nwo:0 "New World Order"
  veg_nwo_desc:0 "The Wasteland is a vile and dangerous place, and the gangs herein are uncouth and violent in the extreme. Those who are not with my plans for peace are against them, and I shall humble them as I did business rivals long ago."

  veg_rockthesuburbs:0 "Clean the Suburbs"
  veg_rockthesuburbs_desc:0 "The Fiends have dominated the suburbs of new Vegas for too long! They terrorize the people of this great city, abusing the innocent so that they can fuel their empire of addiction."

  veg_secure:0 "Secure Power"
  veg_secure_desc:0 "The Hoover Dam still functioned after all these years, a much coveted bridge across the colorado, but more importantly? A source of electricity and power to any who dared try to claim it. I shall have it for myself, so soon as I clear our the local rabble."

  veg_broken:0 "Broken Steel"
  veg_broken_desc:0 "The Mojave Chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel has been a pain in my back for so long as I have known of their existence. Stealing important pieces of technology, scrapping my creations, and robbing the people of New Vegas. I shall snuff them out."

  veg_reborn:0 "HELIOS Reborn"
  veg_reborn_desc:0 "The stockpiles of the Mojave Brotherhood are impressive indeed! Vast quantities of munitions, advanced technology, and other such things lay just below the ground. Digging them out is a small investment, but surely a worthy one."

  veg_securenorth:0 "Secure the North"
  veg_securenorth_desc:0 "The Great Khans are failures by in large, having been removed from their homelands numerous times. Indeed, they are losing a war against their own extinction, and I think it time to hurry them on a little."

  veg_clean:0 "Clean the Mojave"
  veg_clean_desc:0 "The raider gangs within the Mojave were not something I had planned on having to deal with, for they were initially too few in number to matter. Yet as small, defeated gangs trickle in from New California, their numbers and firepower continue to grow. It would be best to remove these pests before they become a true problem. "

  veg_frisco:0 "Reopen the Frisco Mines"
  veg_frisco_desc:0 "The Silvermines in Frisco had always been a personal goal of mine before the war, though I never found the time to get around to opening them, and those who owned the land were unfair with their pricing. But now? There is little that could be done to stop a hostile acquisition."

  veg_silver:0 "Silver Business"
  veg_silver_desc:0 "While rare metals aren't worth what they were before the war, they are still valuable in the extreme. The small but steady income from the Frisco mines is something that helps New Vegas to flourish, and more so? Something I can expand upon in the future."

  veg_architect:0 "Architect of Destiny"
  veg_architect_desc:0 "To say that I planned all of this would be a lie, but to say that I did not take that which I was given and create for myself something new and beautiful would be untrue. I have become the Architect of Destiny, and I shall build for myself a new world."

  veg_platinumchip:0 "The Platinum Chip"

  veg_vault:0 "The Vault"
  veg_vault_desc:0 "The Vault lies across the river, but it is not a challenge to smuggle in an individual capable of opening it, and retrieving for me my army, for there is no force in the wasteland that could stop their departure. They shall finally ensure the safety of my people."

  veg_prime:0 "Vegas Prime"
  veg_prime_desc:0 "The Liberty Prime Project was one of RobCo's most ambitious side projects, and to say that It didn't leave me inspired would be a lie! I set the groundwork for Vegas Prime, a smaller, more manageable variation of that mechanical giant, long ago."

  veg_economy:0 "Economic Miracle"
  veg_economy_desc:0 "New Vegas is going to need to thrive like it did before the War. In order to do that, it's going to need trade, gambling, and all the vices one can imagine. It's not hard to bring about mind you, and I know that the New Vegas will be an economic miracle, just like Vegas was before the bombs fell.."

  veg_foreigninvest:0 "Secure Foreign Investors"
  veg_foreigninvest_desc:0 "The Wasteland is full of eager thrillseekers and greedy souls desperate to earn a quick buck. Thankfully, New Vegas is just the place for such people.

  veg_ncrembassy:0 "NCR Embassy"
  veg_ncrembassy_desc:0 "The New California Republic is a blessing in disguise, easily manipulated, desperate to have Vegas under their control, and with the greatest military this side of the Colorado River. Controlling them, leveraging their military might against outside threats, and exploiting their economic system is going to be essential to the future of New Vegas."

  veg_jointscavenge:0 "Joint Scavenging Company"
  veg_jointscavenge_desc:0 "The Scavengers from the NCR are diligent workers, and so used to picking over cities that have been scavenged for decades that they are constantly finding strong sources of metal within the ruins of New Vegas. Our own scavengers could learn a thing or two from them."

  veg_ncrrail:0 "NCR Rail Network"
  veg_ncrrail_desc:0 "The NCR has proposed the construction of an extensive rail network, in order to better protect against the encroaching might of the legion, and so that they might expedite trade with us. Both of these things are in line with my interests, and shall have my full financial backing."

  veg_ncrdeal:0 "NCR Trade Deal"
  veg_ncrdeal_desc:0 "The New California Republic has offered New Vegas the status of preferred trade Partner, which should allow for preferential treatment during trade negotiations and competitions on both parts. Nothing can come from this but increased NCR dependence on New Vegas, and wealth for my city. What more could a man ask for?"

  veg_newmanagement:0 "New Management"
  veg_newmanagement_desc:0 "Robert House is a relic of the past, a fool who doesn't understand the wasteland or the lives of the people within it. It'll take ambitious minds to bring New Vegas under new management, but thankfully there is no shortage of such minds in the city of sin."

  veg_king:0 "The King"
  veg_king_desc:0 "The King is the voice and soul of the people of New Vegas, the downtrodden many who lived in the ruins of the place before it became a bastion of civilization once again. Frustrated with the mistreatment of his people, and distrustful of the NCR, the King hopes to create a New Vegas that puts its people first."

  veg_everyman:0 "Every Man a King"

  veg_prepcity:0 "Prepare the City"
  veg_prepcity_desc:0 "If New Vegas is to grow, it shall need wealth inimaginable. Thankfully, it is ideally situated to attract just that, with rivers and roads leading to it from miles around, we must simply wait and prepare New Vegas for the wealth that is to come flooding into it."

  veg_segregate:0 "Segregate Vegas"
  veg_segregate_desc:0 "As sad is it is to admit, the poor of New Vegas leech wealth from the strip. They come in masses, building debts they can never repay, destabilizing the delicate balancing act that has brought us such wealth! Freeside should be walled and away from New Vegas, and if they seek to spend caps here? Let them prove they have the caps in the first place."

  veg_revitalize:0 "Revitalise Freeside"
  veg_revitalize_desc:0 "The Strip may be the wealthiest portion of New Vegas, but its people and its soul live in Freeside, with innumerable lesser shops and small homesteads. Offering them proper funding shall surely win over the love of the people of New Vegas."

  veg_vault21:0 "Vault 21"
  veg_vault21_desc:0 "The Vault below New Vegas is a source of great pride for the people of New Vegas, yet it could also be a source of great wealth. The secrets and resources in its lower levels are vast and important, yet it could easily be made into a simple and affordable method of housing the best clientele."

  veg_cerulean:0 "Cerulean Robotics"
  veg_cerulean_desc:0 "The Abandoned Cerulean Robotics facility, located just west of Freeside, has been out of operation since the bombs feel. Now that Vegas is thriving and the majority of the former RobCo installations are up and running again, it only makes sense that such a facility be converted."

  veg_followersupport:0 "Follower Support"
  veg_followersupport_desc:0 "The Followers of the apocalypse arrived in Vegas before House emerged from his coma, and were working to civilize the city for the betterment of mankind. It's not easy to earn their support, and they are idealists in their purest form. Their knowledge of medicine is vast and could prove to be quite the boon to our cause."

  veg_industry:0 "Kickstart Vegas"
  veg_industry_desc:0 "There are dozens of little shops and smaller casinos decorating Vegas, and among them? An insurmountable number of poor and impoverished people. Funding these shops so that they might employ those people would help to kickstart what little economy that isn't dependant on tourism we have."

  veg_walls:0 "The Walls of New Vegas"
  veg_walls_desc:0 "New Vegas is a coveted location, even now the NCR and Legion make moves to vie for its controls, the wills and thoughts of its rulers and people be damned. Protecting the city is a priority to all who care for such things, and protecting the city is exactly what we intend to do."

  veg_muggers:0 "Enlist the Muggers"
  veg_muggers_desc:0 "The Muggers are a particularly violent gang of women, many of whom the elderly widows of raiders who were slain out west, who have gained a reputation for being brutal and effective. That reputation could go far in establishing the King as a man who isn't to be underestimated."

  veg_followers:0 "Follower Integration"
  veg_followers_desc:0 "Among the followers, many idealists believe that the future of the Wasteland should belong to its people and neither of the regional superpowers. Integrating these individuals into our command structure should allow us to gain an edge technologically and morally."

  veg_securitron:0 "Securitron Studies"
  veg_securitron_desc:0 "The Securitrons of New Vegas record absolutely everything that happens within its walls, and with knowledge like that? You could learn almost anything about anyone. Knowing how to exploit this advantage is going to be key in throwing off the yoke of Mr. House."

  veg_vic:0 "General Victor"
  veg_vic_desc:0 "Victor is an oddity from the wasteland, a semi-independent Securitron with a personality unlike any other. Despite largely being a lackey for Mr. House, the removal of a few choice protocols should allow us to win him over using his cowboy sensibilities."

  veg_first:0 "Vegas First"
  veg_first_desc:0 "New Vegas belongs to the people of New Vegas! Our priorities should be the city itself, the people within, and it should be an objective of ours to avoid foreign entanglements."

  veg_mojavesecond:0 "Mojave Second"
  veg_mojavesecond_desc:0 "The Mojave to the south is home to dozens of small communities and settlements that are entirely dependant on New Vegas for their continued survival. It would take a simple act of intervention to win them over to our side!"

  veg_dambusters:0 "Invite the Dam Busters"
  veg_dambusters_desc:0 "The Dam Busters are a small group of advanced technophiles living in the shell of Hoover Dam. Their strategic location puts them at great risk, but then again? An alliance with them could put us in a position of great political power."

  veg_mojavesecure:0 "Secure the Mojave"
  veg_mojavesecure_desc:0 "The lesser raider gangs of the Mojave deserve to be expunged from the land! They have harmed our people and impeded our trade for too long."

  veg_assassinate:0 "Assassinate House"
  veg_assassinate_desc:0 "Mr. House is far too powerful to fight head on. Instead, a more cunning method, like assassination, must be employed to avoid bloodshed in the streets. Getting a man inside won't be easy, but who said things like this ever are?"

  veg_peoplesvegas:0 "Vegas for the People"
  veg_peoplesvegas_desc:0 "The King has done it! Vegas is won and conquered at last, and now free to chase its destiny. Whether that brings it into conflict with local superpowers, or if it merely enjoys a quiet existence of trade and prosperity, none can deny that it will be ready for whatever comes its way."

  veg_joker:0 "The Joker"
  veg_joker_desc:0 "Benny's been with House since the beginning, and there are no doubts as to who's the majordomo in New Vegas. The Joker isn't without his tricks, however; he's the wild card, and he intends to prove it by shaking up the status quo."

  veg_thugs:0 "Benny's Thugs"

  veg_yesman:0 "Yes Man"
  veg_yesman_desc:0 "Yes Man is the key to everything, an easy and effective way to take control over Houses entire security network, and by extension? All of New Vegas. Programming him isn't easy, but hells bells if it won't be worth it."

  veg_lowfriends:0 "Friends in Low Places"
  veg_lowfriends_desc:0 "The Khans are Benny's go to goons, capable of helping him sort out most problems. They are unscrupulous, and are utterly willing to take on any task...for the right price."

  veg_wrongpackage:0 "Wrong Package"
  veg_wrongpackage_desc:0 "Rumour has it a courier is moving something big on behalf of Mr. House. Or at least, that's what Benny's been telling his people, and he's also made it clear that he doesn't intend to let that package reach Mr. House."

  veg_crackthevault:0 "Cracking the Vault"
  veg_crackthevault_desc:0 "It's time to crack open Mr. House's secret weapon, a vault full of military grade robots that will enshrine Benny as the true power in the Mojave. All that he's gotta do is find a way to get to it, but that shouldn't be too hard. After all, even the legion won't turn away a trade caravan."

  veg_allin:0 "All-In"
  veg_allin_desc:0 "They say that Mr. House had the game rigged from the start, but little did they know the player was cheating. Benny had a wild card up his sleeve the entire time, and it's time for the House to pay out. The pot? All of New Vegas baby."

  veg_ringading:0 "Ring-a-Ding-Ding!"
  veg_ringading_desc:0 "Vegas belongs to the Chairmen! More importantly? It belongs to Benny, who's taken up Mr. House's place as ruler and leader of the general area. With all of houses resources at hand and more money than he could have ever dreamed of, Benny is set for life."

  veg_nevadapact:0 "The Nevada Pact"
  veg_nevadapact_desc:0 "There are dozens of small city-states scattered throughout Nevada, between Vegas, Reno and Vault City? You could form an empire in a few years. Who's to say they can't or shouldn't band together, just to stick it to the fat cats in the NCR, or the barbarians out Arizona way?"

  veg_familyman:0 "Family Man"
  veg_familyman_desc:0 "No one gets anywhere in this life without a little bit of help, a nice, healthy support structure to carry him through the bad times. Most people are lucky to have one family, But Benny? Benny has three he can call upon for support."

  veg_familysupremacy_desc:0 "There may always be a bossman in New Vegas, but don't let anyone tell you the Houses aren't supreme in their areas of trade and commerce, violence and intimidation. This city would be nothing without them."

  veg_privatearmies:0 "Private Armies"
  veg_privatearmies_desc:0 "The New Vegas families all field small legion's of armed men and women, ready to enforce their will at a moments notice. A stockpile of weapons like these can be costly, but heavens above is it worthwhile in the long run."

  veg_aligned:0 "Aligning the Families"

  veg_checkereddevil_desc:0 "Benny is legendary for his ability to backstab allies and make the impossible happen.

  veg_ultraluxe:0 "The Ultra-Luxe"
  veg_ultraluxe_desc:0 "The Ultra-Luxe is an establishment of incredible refinement that delicately conceals its operators' more questionable tendencies. There are none who can contest the idea that it's the classiest place on the strip."

  veg_khaganate:0 "The False Khan"
  veg_khaganate_desc:0 "When Mr. House emerged from his slumber, he found two gangs fighting for control of the Vegas streets. House threw his weight behind the Khans, allowing them to defeat the Omertas for control of the streets.

  veg_buryhatchet:0 "Burying the Hatchet"
  veg_buryhatchet_desc:0 "There is no point in furthering the bitter rivalry between our Khan advisors and the Khans who reside to the North.

Maybe it is time to solve our problems and go forwards together..."

  veg_tops:0 "The Tops"

  veg_chairmen:0 "The Chairmen"
  veg_chairmen_desc:0 "The Chairmen embody an ancient “cool” aesthetic of Vegas, plucked from Mr. House's historical data banks.

  veg_arms_desc:0 "The Chairmen have always had an eye for what's hip, be it in the nice suits they wear, the snazzy casino they live in, or the soothing rat-a-tat-tat of the underslung Tommy guns they wield against those unlucky enough to insult their dames. Guns like that don't come cheap, but thankfully they've got caps to spare."

  veg_newdeal:0 "Benny's New Deal"

  veg_kings:0 "The Kings"
  veg_kings_desc:0 "The Greaser Gang known as the Kings were largely resistant to Mr. House's insistent attempts to reform them into civilized folk, and it was only the divine inspiration they found within the ruins of a Freeside establishment that opened their eyes to the glory of the Old World."

  veg_westside_desc:0 "Despite being based on the strip, The Kings have their hearts set on the Westside, where the King himself was once worshipped as a legend of rock and roll. In his honor, and in the name of the people living there, They work to make it a better, safer place."

  veg_gomorrah:0 "Gomorrah"
  veg_gomorrah_desc:0 "Where The Strip's other casinos are refined, the Gomorrah is rough around the edges and coarse, as it offers sleazy sex for sale. Top of the attractions list is prostitution, then booze and drugs, and finally gambling."

  veg_consig:0 "The Consiglieres"
  veg_consig_desc:0 "The Fiends were given a new identity by House, that of the Consiglieres. Styled after the Sicilian mob, they are the new tough men of Vegas, a violent bunch who outdo all other gangs when it comes to sheer intimidation and debaucherous lifestyles.

  veg_skullsandsuits:0 "Skulls and Suits"
  veg_skullsandsuits_desc:0 "The Consiglieres aren't allowed to wear or display bones of humans, but that doesn't stop them from displaying bones.

  veg_mobsters:0 "Mobster Army"
  veg_mobsters_desc:0 "The Omertas are always packing heat, explosives, and a thousand other nasty things. When push comes to shove, they are the closest thing any New Vegas family has to an army, countless men looking to prove themselves."

New Vegas will thrive."
