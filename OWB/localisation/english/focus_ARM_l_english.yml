  arm_advanced_standardization_desc:0 "With the secrets of Armageddon Station now in safe hands, I can reactivate it's strategical computers as well as tactical databanks for my own purposes, which should allow me access to pre-war technology.

  arm_reopening_the_ciudad_victoria_armory_desc:0 "Ciudad Victoria was home to several units of the American army before the war. Tlaloc has kept those depots under lock and key, but it's time for Santa Anna to put them to use. "

Maybe there is a place in this new nation for someone such as myself."
  arm_hardline_approach:0 "Hardline Approach"
  arm_hardline_approach_desc:0 "Just like the hubris of the old world caused its end, so does the new world's democracy set their sight upon the same path. The republic of the Rio Grande cannot be allowed to gain the keys to Armageddon Station, lest they destroy everything I and Father have worked toward. Their quest for power ends today."

  arm_pressure_the_border:0 "Pressure the Border"

Rio will stop at nothing to gain the keys to Armageddon, and go on to use the treasures of Mexico to conquer its people and enslave them.

  arm_tense_negotiations_desc:0 "There is no one left now. No one but myself. I am all alone, without guidance, yet the hardest choice I've ever had to make is ahead of me. Mora seeks the last key to Armageddon, to open the station together and unlock what lurks within. Am I to trust the republic, be by it's side on this historical day? Father, is this what you meant when you asked me to do better? Whatever happens, I will make you proud."
  arm_seizing_armageddon:0 "Seizing Armageddon"
  arm_seizing_armageddon_desc:0 "Two keys. Rio already has two keys. And from what little I know, they might have very well already taken a third. Do they believe themselves invincible, that they fly so close to the sun, ignorant of the fact their wings are burning? I cannot allow them to gain the last key, I must take back control, whatever the cost. Father, forgive me for bringing war to these lands once again..."
  arm_the_southern_threat:0 "The Southern Threat"
  arm_the_southern_threat_desc:0 "A lesser man would have dealt with the Mayans ages ago, their rites and barbaric way an affront to civilization itself. But Tlaloc was kind, and so he didn't act. Tlaloc was generous, and so gave them gifts, hoping to steer them toward a better path. Yet they became set in their ways, complacent, ignorant of His kindness. It is time for the wrath of a lesser man to deal with these savages, once and for all."
  arm_southern_buffer_state:0 "Southern Buffer State"
  arm_southern_buffer_state_desc:0 "Petro Chico's tribals aren't much, but they sit on valuable resources that we could use, and also protect us from the Mayans. We should ensure they aren't crushed by those savages."
  arm_menace_of_yucatan:0 "Menace of Yucatan"
  arm_menace_of_yucatan_desc:0 "Tlaloc never stopped believing in you. Not for a single second, did He think it was futile to try and set you on the right path. Forever and always, caring for His children, and that is what doomed Him, ripped Him from this cruel world, away from me. But, after all this, all those efforts, you still chose to disappoint Him. And still, He would have forgiven you. Yet, I am but His humble son, so I do not have to."
  arm_petro_chico_protection:0 "Petro Chico Protection"
  arm_petro_chico_protection_desc:0 "The simple people that take upon themselves the name of Father's parent company are for the most part peaceful, but with the rise of the Mayans, a choice must be made. If I am to protect them effectively from Itza, I must take over their territory, and stand against the southern threat. Moctezuma, one of my brother, could be of use in my struggle. Yet, it is sure I will have to pay dearly for assistance."
  arm_coastal_preparations:0 "Coastal Preparations"

  arm_shielding_the_coast:0 "Shielding the Coast"
  arm_shielding_the_coast_desc:0 "If I am to maintain naval supremacy over the Aztec savages, I need a powerful enough navy to counter their own. The homeland of many of my ex-militias officers has been offered as the staging ground in the campaign against Chichen Itza, and many citizens are more than willing to help me build up my forces. It is this unity, this willingness to stand and fight that will bring about the end of the tyrant."
  arm_petro_chico_tribute:0 "Petro Chico Tribute"
  arm_petro_chico_tribute_desc:0 "The Refinery, the beating heart of Petro Chico, has been left to rot for far too long. Its towering buildings and complicated mechanism became sites of worships for the tribals, and while this is understandable, I will sadly have to clear them out. Let them take solace in its reactivation, for now, more than spiritual guidance, it offers wealth and prosperity to Mexico and its people."
  arm_naval_awakening:0 "Naval Awakening"
  arm_naval_awakening_desc:0 "To protect and care for the people, we must make sure to cover every facet of warfare, from ground combat to naval battles. Our nautical capabilities are currently... quite poor, if I am to be honest. Catching up with our neighbors in term of technology will be a first step toward securing Mexico's coast."
  arm_naval_requirements:0 "Naval Requirements"
  arm_naval_requirements_desc:0 "With our technological edge secured, now we must make sure to manufacture said equipment to an extent where we can contest our neighbors. Investing heavily into shipyards using the Tampico port's previous economical buildup should see us well on our way to gain naval might."
  arm_coastal_militia_integration:0 "Coastal Militia Integration"
  arm_coastal_militia_integration_desc:0 "There are many coastal militias throughout our land that have seen fit to protect their lands against Itzan raiders, or other bandits. Their courage is admirable, and their skill as sailor second to none. It would be most beneficial to extend an invitation for them to join my navy as officers, and surely they will accept once they learn of my plans concerning the Aztec menace."
  arm_mechanical_volunteers:0 "A Well-oiled Machine"
  arm_mechanical_volunteers_desc:0 "Petro Chico's legacy seems to live on to this day. Deep within the refinery, it seems like they had taken upon themselves to gain limited autonomy by constructing robot manufacturing plants, able to automate most day-to-day tasks. We will repurpose them to strengthen the might of my army, and use them to strike ever deeper south. No tyrant shall be spared."
  arm_appointing_the_almirante:0 "Appointing the Almirante"
  arm_appointing_the_almirante_desc:0 "Few in the proud nation can possibly argue to have the skill necessary to act as supreme admiral. Further study of my internal databanks have allowed me to find many documentations and studies about naval warfare, graciously provided by the United State's military records. And so, it falls upon me to guide our newborn navy against the aggressors, and lead Ejército Mexicano to victory!"
  arm_coastal_ship_conscription:0 "Sailors' Lessons"

  arm_tamaulipas_militias:0 "Tamaulipas Militias"
  arm_tamaulipas_militias_desc:0 "The militias of Tamaulipas are nothing more than raiders by another name. Santa Anna can conscript them, or use them as target practice."
  arm_dismantling_the_el_colibri_cartel:0 "Dismantling The El Colibrí Cartel"
  arm_dismantling_the_el_colibri_cartel_desc:0 "Why would Santa Anna work with a bunch of drug dealers?  Do you think he came back from the dead just to put up with some junkies?"
  arm_absorbing_the_el_colibri_cartel:0 "Absorbing The El Colibrí Cartel"
  arm_absorbing_the_el_colibri_cartel_desc:0 "Apparently, Santa Anna did come back from the dead to just deal with some junkies."
  arm_dismantling_tamaulipas_militias:0 "Dismantling Tamaulipas Militias"
  arm_dismantling_tamaulipas_militias_desc:0 "The only problem Santa Anna has with the militia is that they're too close for missiles.  So let's switch to guns."
  arm_absorbing_tamaulipas_militias:0 "Absorbing Tamaulipas Militias"
  arm_absorbing_tamaulipas_militias_desc:0 "While we could kill the militias, it's far better to give them ration scrip to kill our enemies!"

  arm_order_from_chaos:0 "The Battle of Veracruz"
  arm_order_from_chaos_desc:0 "The Battle of Veracruz was a 20-day siege of the key Mexican beachhead seaport of Veracruz during the Mexican–American War. Lasting from March 9–29, 1847.. At least, so we have thought. From a different outlook the battle has still been going on for centuries - Veracruz trading hands between American and Mexican forces in an endless struggle."
  arm_loyalty_of_the_people:0 "Loyalty Of The People"

  arm_reckless_anger:0 "Reckless Anger"
  arm_reckless_anger_desc:0 "This is the fault of the fucking Gringos who built Tlaloc. They've done nothing but harm my country and family since the 19th century. They take land with their armies, our resources with their treaties, and our hopes with their culture. And now they take my father?"
  arm_desperate_bargaining:0 "Desperate Bargaining"

  arm_family_fight_desc:0 "Already, my 'siblings' have wasted no time to begin their petty squabbling. This has gone on for long enough. They dare thread where He once stood, fight and bleed His people dry in the name of their madness. No more. It is time to show them why I am the older brother."
  arm_texas:0 "The Liberation of Texas"
  arm_texas_desc:0 "Texas is the home of some of the most despicable elements of the wastes. Rampant militarism, pitiful mutants clinging to their past, cannibals, raiders... abominations. This cannot go on, but I need a northern bridgehead. The Pursuant are despicable cowards delighting in the hunt and butcher of innocents, and will serve this purpose just fine.

  arm_alamo_desc:0 "The Alamo chapter, formed as a rival of the Texan Brotherhood and seeking to gain independence, has been of interest to me since their recent inception. I've studied them at great length, seeking to find if they were worth tolerating as to avoid any bloodshed, but it seems that sadly they are just as disgraceful as the ones they seek to distance themselves from. The Alamo shall fall to Mexico once again."
  arm_big_iron:0 "Big Iron"
  arm_big_iron_desc:0 "Out of all the splinter warbands resulting from Attis' bloodthirst resulting in his comeuppance, the Ironmongers remain the most hopelessly violent of the three, composed only of dull soldiers seeking whatever scrap they can fight for.

History shows that those 'Haciendas' are harmful to both economical growth, and the liberty of the people. I will break them into individual properties to help local development, and by that action also gain the loyalty of the many villages affected."
  arm_departments:0 "The Departmentos"
  arm_departments_desc:0 "This nation does not need a set of independent, or even autonomous, regions. I will reorganize it into departments under my control, starting with the [RRG.GetName]. They will learn of my achievements, and of my promises. I will protect Mexico and care for its people, whether they accept this fact or are dragged screaming into a better tomorrow is their choice."
  ARM_department_modifier:0 "The Departments"
  #### New stuff
  arm_republic_no_king:0 "Little Need for an Emperor"
  arm_republic_no_king_desc:0 "SANTA ANNA QUOTE MONARCHY"
  arm_tampico_port:0 "The Port of Tampico"
  arm_tampico_port_desc:0 "Tampico, the Place of Otters in Huastec, was a major port before the Great War. The Norteamericanos transferred the wealth of their occupation out of our country, never to return. We will refit and modernize it, to have it serve as a mighty trading hub for the people of Mexico, and increase our naval capabilities."
  arm_lessons_from_max:0 "Maximilian's Lessons"
  arm_lessons_from_max_desc:0 "Perhaps Maximilian, although a fool, had some things to teach us. He looked out for his people in a way we have, regrettably, failed to do."
  arm_our_sea:0 "The Gulf of Mexico"
  arm_our_sea_desc:0 "With my control over the Refinery and the destruction of [ITZ.GetName], I have finally secured peace throughout the gulf of Mexico. Yet there are many more battles to fight, and I will not let brave sailors bleed needlessly. My robots will work around the clock on improving the naval capabilities of Ejército Mexicano, be it through exercises or experiments. Let the enemy tremble before the might of our ships."
  arm_aircraft_jet:0 "Flying Shotgun to Armageddon"
  arm_aircraft_jet_desc:0 "At last, the four horsemen of the apocalypse have come to Armageddon Station, and it's heavy door was finally opened after decades. Within lurks both wealth beyond measure, and madness beyond comprehension. It will now be harnessed, brought under control, it's secret studied and applied properly. The sky will be under our control once again. The Mexican eagle shall soar."
  arm_no_peasants:0 "The Peasant Rebellion"
  arm_no_peasants_desc:0 "In my time, I have learnt much from the history of Mexico. Zapata's ideal lives on to this day, in its people and their heart, even if the name itself as well as its history has been forgotten decades ago. The pale copy taking on his name is nothing but an usurper, threatening to bring this glorious nation to its knees once again. I will not let this happen."
  arm_god_fearing_robot:0 "A God Fearing Robot"
  arm_god_fearing_robot_desc:0 "And lo, though Tlaloc was not flesh and bone, I chose to believe he still had a heart, as well as a soul. Mexicans find solace in the words of the Lord, and so should I, for what am I but a humble servant of His people? May you rest comforted for all of eternity, Father. Your legacy shall not be sullied."
  arm_help_carthage:0 "Arm Carthage"
  arm_help_carthage_desc:0 "The tenuous relationship between Carthage and the Texan Brotherhood, owing to the former's raider heritage, could be to my advantage in the upcoming conflict. It would be unacceptable to leave the fate of the Texan people in the hands of dullards foolishly seeing themselves as peacekeepers, but first they must be weakened. Arming their adversary for a pre-emptive strike shall do just fine..."
  arm_help_carthage_tt:0 "\nCarthage will get technological assistance and infantry equipment from scavenged stockpiles."
  arm_todd_just_works:0 "The Empresarios"
  arm_todd_just_works_desc:0 "Todd Howitzer was no friend of Texas or Rio, but nor is he a friend of Mexico.  Still, he is not the first upstart foreigner to serve la patria. 19th Century Mexico provided grants (known as Empresarios) to those who ruled land in exchange for the responsibility of settling land. Why should we not recognize Todd's empresario along the Rio Grande, so long as he supports us? As Todd says, 'Simplemente Funciona!'"
  arm_avenge_mexico:0 "Crush the Rebels!"
  arm_avenge_mexico_desc:0 "For too long has the Brotherhood pretended to represent the will of the people, while all that they seek is to further their own interest and bring all of Texas under their control. No more. It is time for me to take the reign, and guide the Texan people toward a new, prosperous future."
  arm_master_of_mexico_ii:0 "Mexico Reborn!"
  arm_master_of_mexico_ii_desc:0 "Finally, it is done. I've devoted all of my existence to liberating Texas, and worked tirelessly for the benefit of the Mexican people, but now with those goals accomplished, all that is left is to take stock of what remains. Father's resting place has been the centre of my rule, but now, with all said and done? It became so... cold, so silent. Maybe... maybe taking some time to rest is for the best..."
  arm_no_kings:0 "Against the Emperor"
  arm_no_kings_desc:0 "The mad emperor has risen, an empty and eerie parody of Maximilian The First, controversial if still well established historical figure. Already the puppet taking his name seeks to bring Mexico under his iron fist, and reform it into a horrible absolute monarchy to the detriment of its people. I will not allow this lunacy to happen."
  arm_bad_aztec:0 "End Human Sacrifice"
  arm_bad_aztec_desc:0 "Never in my existence have I felt such loathing, such... hatred for another being. Disgusting, Abominable pawn that dares call itself Moctezuma, you have the audacity to make a mockery of Father's legacy? You stand here today, using His databanks to slaughter His people, to drown the land in blood for your meaningless conquest. Shockingly, I feel that I will enjoy tearing you apart immensely."
  arm_brought_to_heel:0 "Las Bases Organicas"
  arm_brought_to_heel_desc:0 "Finally, Tlaloc's legacy has been secured. At last I can rest easy knowing His children are safe, and that my... 'brothers' are finally under control. Never again will I let them spread their corrupted influence over the Mexican people, they will be wiped from the network, every trace of the abomination of their existence erased. Still... their specific sub-routine could prove useful in the future."
  arm_brought_to_heel_tt:0 "Tlaloc's children will now serve the President as advisors."
  arm_tlalocs_son:0 "Tlaloc's Favoured Son"
  arm_tlalocs_son_desc:0 "Many of my brothers saw fit to steal Tlaloc's secrets as well as research, using it for their own twisted purposes. With them now destroyed, and their databanks under my control, I can finally begin to study the many advances and mountain of data that Father has left me. Hopefully, it will serve the interest of the people this time around."
  arm_monterrey_money:0 "Modernize Monterrey"
  arm_monterrey_money_desc:0 "Monterrey was once the gem of Northern Mexico. Indeed, in 1847 I fought the Norteamericanos to a standstill outside its walls. Outnumbered, outgunned, I tactically advanced in the opposite direction, a draw which rankles me still. Nevertheless, but upgrading the city all will know that Mexico is, once more, in my firm hands."
