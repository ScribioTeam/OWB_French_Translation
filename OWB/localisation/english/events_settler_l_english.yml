  nf_settler.1.t:0 "What our Forefather's gave us"
  nf_settler.1.d:0 "Every settlement is built on the backs of those who came before, those who managed to scrape a living from the ruins of the old world. We are defined by what it was that our forefathers left behind for us, and while we can never repay them, remembering where it was that we came from will help us look to our future."
  nf_settler.1.a:0 "Our forefathers left us clean Water."
  nf_settler.1.b:0 "Our forefathers left us with firepower."
  nf_settler.1.c:0 "Our forefathers left us the factories."

  nf_settler.2.t:0 "What kind of City are we?"
  nf_settler.2.d:0 "Any settlement worth a damn has something that it does particularly well. Booze. Water. Guns. You name it, someone's out there doing it, and making a killing while doing it. But folks like us? We think big picture, we do half a dozen things really well, it's how you stay on top. It's how you become a hotspot settlement."
  nf_settler.2.a:0 "We are a hub for mercenaries and scoundrels."
  nf_settler.2.b:0 "Salvage! Metal, water, and everything else!"
  nf_settler.2.c:0 "A city of vice! We sell whatever someone wants."

  nf_settler.3.t:0 "What will we become?"
  nf_settler.3.d:0 "That's the question on everyone's lips, what will we become? Who do we want to be? Every settlement is a little different. Most just want to be safe, they want to raiders to stop coming, they want the mutants to leave the area, and they want the water to stay clean? But us? We know that you can't get there without greater ambitions."
  nf_settler.3.a:0 "And so we will become powerful!"
  nf_settler.3.b:0 "And so we will become advanced!"
  nf_settler.3.c:0 "We will become wealthy!"
