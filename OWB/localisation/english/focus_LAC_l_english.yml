  lac_the_history_of_war_desc:0 "Throughout history, there were men who boasted that they came, they saw, they conquered. Their dead hands still grasp the hand of history; if you are ever to break free of their grip, you must know why."
  lac_folly_of_carrhae:0 "The Folly of Carrhae"
  lac_folly_of_carrhae_desc:0 "Carrhae is the story of an army that went too far in pursuit of greed.  Seeking gold and plunder, they died alone in a desert, with their king drowning on gold. Perhaps you can learn from this."
  lac_legend_of_arbela:0  "The Legend of Arbela"
  lac_legend_of_arbela_desc:0 " There was a great battle when an army of heroes, bristling in dense array, stood together against all the terror of a god. Few in number, strong in arms and armor - a sign that quality has a quantity all its own."
  lac_battle_of_marathon:0 "The Battle of the Marathon"
  lac_battle_of_marathon_desc:0 "And the Persians, who saw the Athenians advancing toward them on the double, prepared to meet their attack; they assumed that the Athenians were seized by some utterly self-destructive madness, but they won. They chose not to reduce let their city fall to slavery; they ensured its freedom and left a memorial to all posterity.  So standing on a Persian's grave, can you deem yourself a slave?"
  lac_building_a_true_legion:0 "Building a True Legion"
  lac_building_a_true_legion_desc:0 "Soldier, what I have to offer you is fatigue, danger, struggle and death; the chill of the cold night in the free air, and heat under the burning sun; no lodgings, no munitions, no provisions, but forced marches, dangerous watch-posts and the continual struggle with the bayonet against batteries;- - those who love freedom may follow me."
  lac_equites:0 "The Equites"

  lac_hastati:0 "The Hastati"
  lac_hastati_desc:0 "The Hastati are some of the poorest men in our army, those who could afford only modest equipment. Let us pay for their firearms and gear. They will never get a chance to be brave if they die before combat begins."
  lac_triarii:0 "The Triarii"
  lac_triarii_desc:0 "The Triarii will be the elite of our army, the core we will use at the decisive point in any conflict. Armed with grenades and other explosives, I think foul scorn of any who think they have a chance."
  lac_speculatores:0 "The Speculatores"
  lac_speculatores_desc:0 "No need to rely on frumentarii as spies, when our own merchants will gladly share information with us. The merchants do seem to know everything, even if everything has a price to them."
  lac_testudo:0 "The Testudo"
  lac_testudo_desc:0 "The Testudo is another of Diana's ideas.  We will use small unit tactics where warriors support one another with concentrated fire and movement, acting as one. Aye, this will make it harder for any one soldier to win glory - but victory has a thousand fathers."
  lac_quincunx:0 "The Quincunx"
  lac_quincunx_desc:0 "The needs of total war push our lands to the breaking point.  This new coin can help to pay our soldiers, although it will weaken faith in the coin of the Legion."
  lac_liberti:0 "Libertas"
  lac_liberti_desc:0 "Some of the profligates we once enslaved may fight for us, if we grant them freedom. So be it - for did I not promise to set the Wastes free, in ways they could not imagine?"

  lac_skilled_arial_gliders:0 "The Eagle's Wings"
  lac_skilled_arial_gliders_desc:0 "And Lanius said of all the animals, he envied the eagle the most; for it flew high, and cracked its food upon the rocks below."
  lac_a_gift_from_the_factory:0 "A Gift From the Factory"
  lac_a_gift_from_the_factory_desc:0 "They say beware of gods bearing gifts - but is this not a sacred honour from the Moon? Who but the Chosen One of the gods could deserve a G.E.C.K.?"
  lac_terra_firma:0 "Esto Perpetua"
  lac_terra_firma_desc:0 "We are not in the situation of poor Alexander the Great, who wept, as well indeed he might, because there were no more worlds to conquer.  To make justice in the broken shards of this world, there is enough to do, in war or peace, to keep our risible muscles and our pens going until the end of days."
  lac_confronting_loyalists:0 "Confronting Loyalists"
  lac_confronting_loyalists_desc:0 "Wars, both civil and foreign, I undertook throughout the world, on sea and land, and when victorious I spared all citizens who sued for pardon. The foreign nations which could with safety be pardoned I preferred to save rather than to destroy."
  lac_path_towards_integration:0 "You May Call It Peace"
  lac_path_towards_integration_desc:0 "Having obtained all things through the will of the Wasteland, the people clothed me with laurels and a crown, and an inscription which testified to my virtue, mercy, justice, and piety.  I exceeded all in influence, but had no greater power than any other warrior. I was the friend to all and master of none.  Remember me, and what I have done for you."
  lac_rebuilding_the_cohort:0 "Rebuilding the Cohort"
  lac_rebuilding_the_cohort_desc:0 "Lanius, remember by your strength to rule\nEarth's people—for your arts are to be these -\nTo pacify, to impose the rule of law, \nTo spare the conquered, battle down the proud."

  lac_outsmart_the_enemy:0 "Outsmart The Enemy"
  lac_outsmart_the_enemy_desc:0 "It is much better to overcome the enemy by famine, surprise or terror than by general actions, for in the latter instance fortune has often a greater share than valour. Those designs are best which the enemy are entirely ignorant of till the moment of execution. Opportunity in war is often more to be depended on than courage."
  lac_approach_dineta:0 "Approach the Navajo"
  lac_approach_dineta_desc:0 "The Navajo work with Caesar for want of any alternatives. But the ancient Greeks (whoever they were) aren't the only people to worship a goddess of the hunt. Perhaps we can invite them to our pact against Caesar."
  lac_painted_rock_2:0 "Paint the Rock"
  lac_painted_rock_2_desc:0 "The savages of the Painted Rock are a threat to... well, not much. But they would be useful in the coming struggle."
  lac_war_prep_1:0 "The Greatest Smile"
  lac_war_prep_1_desc:0 "“The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly; it is dearness only that gives everything its value.

  lac_war_prep_2:0 "The Band of Brothers"
  lac_war_prep_2_desc:0 "Caesar asks you to fight for his glory, and for his cause. But you should fight for your glory. For this is not a triumph for me. It is a triumph for all who fight with me. My victory is yours, and yours is mine."
  lac_war_prep_3:0 "The Volunteers"
  lac_war_prep_3_desc:0 "Do not call me a dictator, or a monster. The whole of New Mexico voluntarily took an oath of allegiance to me and demanded me as its leader in the war."
  lac_war_prep_4:0 "The Cornerstone of Empire"
  lac_war_prep_4_desc:0 "The men and women who supply my forces are a humourless lot, but, then, they know that if I lose, they will be the first I slay.  but that is because the line between victory and defeat, all too often, depends on logistics."

  lac_war_prep_1b:0 "Cut Back Spending"
  lac_war_prep_1b_desc:0 "If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity. Let us not treat our soldiers' lives like caps at some profligate's bar."
  lac_the_looting_of_flagstaff:0 "The Sack of Flagstaff"
  lac_the_looting_of_flagstaff_desc:0 "As Lanius watched Flagstaff burn, he was wrapped long in thought. For all cities, nations, and rulers must, in the end, meet their doom; that is what happened to America, the Lambda, and to the empires of Greece and Rome. Perhaps all glory would fade; perhaps war never changes."
  lac_exile_to_the_savage_south:0 "To the Savage South"

  lac_yearning_for_a_stable_world_desc:0 "A wise man once told me that if war never changes, then men must change, and so must their symbols.  And men can only change based on the roads they walk. Hear the words of Lanius, the myth of the East."
  lac_exile_to_the_far_west:0 "The Setting Sun"
  lac_exile_to_the_far_west_desc:0 "Caesar's time ended, like just as every day must end. Let us send him west, so he can follow the sun."

  lac_destroy_the_reservation:0 "Reservations About Separatism"
  lac_destroy_the_reservation_desc:0 "While Caesar profited from trade with the Reservation, we can only imagine the grim fate that awaits the many slaves who go into those lands but do not come out. It is time to end this once and for all."

  lac_city_of_lights:0 "The Glowing Day"
  lac_city_of_lights_desc:0 "Dayglow is the greatest of California's cities, and a bustling port on the wine dark sea. We could do worse than move there, and look upon the horizon. Perhaps we will find out lies beyond our vision."
  lac_alliance_with_the_omertas:0 "The Importance of Family"
  lac_alliance_with_the_omertas_desc:0 "The Omertas are the greatest of the Vegas families and crucial to its wealth. While some may wish for their destruction, a good shepherd shears his sheep; he does not flay them."
  lac_the_grand_lighthouse:0 "The Great Lighthouse"
  lac_the_grand_lighthouse_desc:0 "The Lucky 38 is the marvel of Vegas. Far better to make it a monument to the people, than leave it as a ghost's home."
  lac_treasures_caesar_left_behind_desc:0 "After my victory I replaced in all the shrines and temples in all the cities of the province of Arizona the ornaments which my foe used in war for his private use. And when they built statues of me, on foot, on chariot, and on motorbike these I myself removed."

  lac_gardens_of_balboa:0 "The Gardens of Balboa"
  lac_gardens_of_balboa_desc:0 "Diana told me she once visited a garden in Dayglow, a place of beauty and wonder adorned with nature's riches. How fitting would it be to offer her a new shrine on the western shore?"
  lac_the_midway:0 "The Midway"
  lac_the_midway_desc:0 "Dayglow contains a museum to an ancient vessel which fought in some long forgotten war. But there is much wisdom in the ruins, if you know where to look."
  lac_challenge_the_brotherhoods:0 "Challenge the Brotherhoods"

  lac_veg:0 "Take Out Vegas"
  lac_veg_desc:0 "For the cowards in Vegas who think their wealth is the salvation of mankind, they will find coins are a worse ammunition. But perhaps they can pay the tolls on the highway of the dead."
  lac_new_california:0 "To the Western Shores"
  lac_new_california_desc:0 "The NCR's people suffer under a bloated, dying aristocracy. They call themselves servants of the people, but ever since Queen Tandi died its leader wallowed in filth while people hungered.

  lac_grand_reconcilliation_act:0 "For the Public Things"
  lac_grand_reconcilliation_act_desc:0 "With Caesar's exile, it is time to take the next step.  No longer shall we be a Legion, an army in search of a state. We serve the people, and build a state which shall stand the test of time.  \n\nWhen you write my words, know I fought for the people."
  lac_invite_sleepers:0 "The Sleepers Must Awaken"

And now they lie in ruins.  \n\nUntil now."
  lac_the_phoenix_agreement:0 "The Phoenix Agreement"
  lac_the_phoenix_agreement_desc:0 "In Phoenix I restored liberty to the commons, which were oppressed by the tyranny of faction.

  lac_a_new_pantheon_desc:0 "Lanius sacrificed to the gods to whom it was his custom to sacrifice, and gave a public banquet, seated all the Legionaries, and then any persons from the other peoples who took precedence for rank or any other high quality, and he himself and those around him drank from the same bowl and poured the same libations, with the soothsayers and priestesses initiating the ceremony."

  lac_temple_of_athena_desc:0 "I begin to sing of Pallas Athene, the glorious goddess, bright-eyed, inventive, unbending of heart, pure virgin, saviour of cities, courageous.

Hail, goddess, and give us good fortune with happiness!"

  lac_temple_in_chains:0 "The Chained Temple"
  lac_temple_in_chains_desc:0 "The Brotherhood's reach extends even to Colorado, where they hoard the ways of the old world. Taking the bunker would give us access to great wealth and power, and Diana could certainly put it to better use. But perhaps we can persuade them that Caesar is a threat to all of us."
