  vlt_all_clear:0 "The All Clear"
  vlt_all_clear_desc:0 "While our records are not entirely certain about when Vault 8 opened, it is clear that it was in the first one or two decades after the bombs fell. The world was a very different place back then.\nWhat were our first steps?"


  vlt_gecko_friends:0 "The Ghouls of Gecko"
  vlt_gecko_friends_desc:0 "Although we almost came to blows with our ghoulish neighbours, we were able to broker an agreement."

  vlt_the_outside_world:0 "The Outworld"
  vlt_the_outside_world_desc:0 "The gem of the wasteland has never been as bigoted as some portray, and worthy Wastelanders have always been able to gain citizenship. But we cannot let everyone into the utopia. Some gain citizenship due to their penetrating intellect, some by a service to Vault City, and some by a bit of both."

  vlt_presence_bear:0 "The Presence of the Bear"
  vlt_presence_bear_desc:0 "Love it or hate it, the NCR is the strongest power in the Wasteland that we know of. Some chafe at the subsidy we pay to them, while others recognize its better for them to die in pursuit of empire than our youth."

  vlt_end_of_a_term:0 "End of a Term"
  vlt_end_of_a_term_desc:0 "By all appearances, Lynette's term as First Citizen will be one of many, like her mother before her. But Security Chief Maier has adopted the Californian heresy... and is pushing for an election. Will the wisdom of Vault City prevail, or will mob rule come to the City of Tomorrow?"

  maier_support_tt:0 "Boosts Support for §MDemocracy§! and improves the standing of Maier's §MCitizen League§! party!"

  vlt_election_garrison:0 "Condemn the Garrison!"
  vlt_election_garrison_desc:0 "Lynette's mother made us the joke of the Wasteland, reliant upon jetted up NCR soldiers to protect us. It is time for them to withdraw once and for all, and if elected, I shall prepare us to stand on our own two feet."

  vlt_election_reno_trade:0 "Trade With Reno"
  vlt_election_reno_trade_desc:0 "Vault City has traditionally spurned New Reno, but there are some fine people there. Even if they need to be saved from their decadent ways, there's no reason to think they're subhuman."

  vlt_election_legalize:0 "Legalize It!"
  vlt_election_legalize_desc:0 "The Council has long banned alcohol from the City, but there is nothing wrong with vice in moderation. And, in fact, some rumours say members of the Council indulge on the side. If it's good enough for them, it's bad enough for you!"

  vlt_election_immigrants:0 "Welcome Immigrants"
  vlt_election_immigrants_desc:0 "Maier is far from the only immigrant to make Vault City a better place. Who can forget the resident of Vault 13 who served as Captain of the Guard? We must welcome the best and brightest to our utopia."

  vlt_election_support_guard:0 "Support the Guard"
  vlt_election_support_guard_desc:0 "If we will expel the Californian tyranny, we will need to stand up for ourselves. We shall always be on Guard for you!"

  vlt_election_mutant_threat:0 "The Mutant Threat"
  vlt_election_mutant_threat_desc:0 "We have tolerated ghouls for too long. We will build a nation free of the threat of ferals, or FEV tanks, or cannibalistic monsters. We will build a promised land for the pure."

  vlt_election_wasteland_workshop:0 "The Workshop of the Wasteland"
  vlt_election_wasteland_workshop_desc:0 "Lynette's peace and prosperity is nothing to sneer at. Let the Californians die for the Mojave; or spend their lives shovelling brahmin dung. We will build a utopia."

  vlt_election_courtyard_supermutants:0 "Let Super Mutants in the Courtyard"
  vlt_election_courtyard_supermutants_desc:0 "Although we shouldn't let Super mutants in our city, a few of them are no threat in the Courtyard! They bring unique and valuable skills."

  vlt_election_wasteland_scholars:0 "Wastelander Scholars"
  vlt_election_wasteland_scholars_desc:0 "Although we are the smartest people in the Waste, there are just so, so many Wastelanders that some of them rival our brilliance."

  vlt_election_new_generation:0 "The New Generation"
  vlt_election_new_generation_desc:0 "Lynette's prosperity will let Vault City start a new cycle of children ahead of schedule! Please schedule your appointment with Vault City medical to see who your partner will be!"

  vlt_election_california_girls:0 "You'll Wish They Could All Be California Girls"
  vlt_election_california_girls_desc:0 "For all its flaws, the NCR is the most successful state in the Wasteland. Would you prefer to align with people who are, literally, called Bone Dancers? Or the techno-knights of Lost Hills? No, let us celebrate our ties to the largest civilization in the Wastes."

  vlt_election_new_entertainment:0 "New Entertainment"
  vlt_election_new_entertainment_desc:0 "Although criticisms by some of our youth that Vault City is 'designed for octogenarians' are unfair, one way to beat Maier is to promise more freedom of expression. I quite liked some of these comics when I studied abroad!"

  vlt_the_election_of_2275:0 "The Selection of 2275"
  vlt_the_election_of_2275_desc:0 "Vault City stands at a crossroads. Will it continue the traditions that have made it a light in the darkness? Or can it stand for something more?\nIt will all come down to the decision reached on the evening of the §Gfirst of July§!."

  vlt_a_new_direction:0 "A New Direction"
  vlt_a_new_direction_desc:0 "The first thing First Citizen Maier did after his Selection win was to cut down the bureaucratic mess of forms, appointments and meetings that was needed to become a citizen of Vault City. Instead it was replaced with a way simpler system of either joining the Guard or the Corps of Engineering for a certain time. A stable job, a good, safe place to live inside our walls and after your time is up, you become a full citizen."

  vlt_service_for_citizenship:0 "Service for Citizenship"
  vlt_service_for_citizenship_desc:0 "Nowadays you have the option to skip the indentured servant step, but the whole process is still a bureaucratic mess of forms, appointments and meetings that can figuratively (and sometimes literally) take years, while the candidates are still waiting, living outside our walls in ramshackle huts. We could streamline the process if we gave the option to serve in the Guard or Corps of Engineering instead. A stable job, a good, safe place to live inside our walls and after a few years you get a free pass to become a full citizen."
  vlt_corps_of_engineering:0 "The Corps of Engineering"
  vlt_corps_of_engineering_desc:0 "The issue with recruiting outworlder... sorry, 'future citizens' for our Corps of Engineering is that we really don't have a Corps of Engineering. We have a Maintenance Center but the building itself is not really suited for more than a few people at best. So the first task for our newly formed Corps of Engineering is building something they can actually work out of."
  vlt_tackling_new_projects:0 "Tackling New Projects"
  vlt_tackling_new_projects_desc:0 "There is always more work to be done. As soon as we solve longstanding internal issues, we can finally look outward. No more resting on our perceived superiority."
  vlt_office_for_salvage_and_reclamation:0 "Office for Salvage and Reclamation"
  vlt_office_for_salvage_and_reclamation_desc:0 "There are many pre-war facilities that survived the great war scattered all over the wasteland. A lot of the time the most interesting bits are mostly untouched because the average wastelander has no idea what to do with the high-tech machinery within those facilities. Good for us."
  vlt_office_for_military_technology:0 "Office for Military Technology"
  vlt_office_for_military_technology_desc:0 "As the most advanced city in the Wasteland, bolstered by those loyal to the idea of a free, human Nevada, we can easily equip a military force that even the Brotherhood would envy."
  vlt_machines_of_war:0 "Machines of War"
  vlt_machines_of_war_desc:0 "The tank has been a mainstay of the armed forces for three world wars. Even if it was gradually phased out for power armor during the last one, the effectiveness of the tank is not to be underestimated. We probably will not be able to field a massive amount of them, but giving our technical expertise, the ones we can will be devastating."
  vlt_the_power_of_armor:0 "The Power of Armor"
  vlt_the_power_of_armor_desc:0 "The simple fact that various models of Power Armor can still be found, despite being exposed to 200 years of harsh wasteland conditions speaks volume of their design. And who is better suited to use these marvels of pre-war technology than us?\nNot to mention that we found some plans for Vault-Tec branded Power Armor in our mainframe."
  vlt_the_courtyard_push:0 "The Courtyard Push"
  vlt_the_courtyard_push_desc:0 "With our new path to citizenship established it's time to deal with the courtyard. An aggressive recruitment push will bring a good chunk of the courtyard populace into the fold. This will also make it easier for further projects in the area. Can't be a shining beacon of civilization, if you have to wade through literal filth right at our gates."
  vlt_courtyard_district:0 "The Courtyard District"
  vlt_courtyard_district_desc:0 "The Courtyard is the first place outworlders enter in Vault City, but it could be so much more.  As we open citizenship up to our fellow Nevadans, let's expand the district to make homes for them.  Let's turn these slums into homes worthy of Vault City citizens."
  vlt_expanding_vault_city:0 "Expanding the Vault City Walls"
  vlt_expanding_vault_city_desc:0 "With our rising population due to the influx of new outworld citizens space inside our walls has gotten slightly more scarce. While it's not really feasible to produce the same hight and strength walls as our current ones on a much larger scale, an effort must be made to protect all our citizens. Rusted car husks do not provide sufficient protection."
  vlt_expanding_vault_city_tt:0 "Add §Y3 Outposts§! along the southern border of the Courtyard District."
  vlt_winnemucca_outpost:0 "Winnemucca Outpost"
  vlt_winnemucca_outpost_desc:0 "Winnemucca has been a Vault City outpost for a while now. The eastward facing defensive encampment was meant to give us early warning if a larger force approaches. Despite the fact that over the years a sizeable amount of wastelanders have settled close to it, it was always treated as an afterthought. We should improve the outpost's infrastructure and consider what to do about the wastelanders."
  vlt_disaster_waiting_to_happen:0 "A Disaster Waiting to Happen"
  vlt_disaster_waiting_to_happen_desc:0 "Our relationship with the ghouls in the Gecko power plant has been tenuous at best. There is no interaction beyond our trade of supplies for electricity. If the power connection would be interrupted for any reason... like them going feral, or just trying to ransom us for more, we would be completely helpless. The old vault generator just can't support our defences that keep the wasteland at bay. "
  vlt_disaster_waiting_to_happen_tt:0 "§YCitizen Carter§! becomes available for service."
  vlt_kicking_out_the_ghouls:0 "Kick Out the Ghouls"
  vlt_kicking_out_the_ghouls_desc:0 "With our Guard having a surplus of manpower for once, we can finally do something about our ghoulified neighbours. It's doubtful they'll put up much of a fight, but you'll never know for sure with those Ghouls."
  vlt_kicking_out_the_ghouls_tt:0 "Reduces the Output of the §YGecko Power Plant§! by §R15§!£resources_strip|2 but removes the §YConstruction§! and §YManpower§! penalties."
  vlt_renovate_the_power_plant:0 "Renovate the Power Plant"
  vlt_renovate_the_power_plant_desc:0 "Supposedly the power plant in Gecko was 'fixed' 30 years ago. What was fixed was the ghouls almost killing us with their carelessness. A good part of the structure is still slowly but surely falling apart and it is only a matter of time until it all goes horribly wrong. The duty to keep this from happening now falls to us. Especially since we may have broken some things while getting it under our control."
  vlt_assault_concluded_tt:0 "Unlocks decisions to repair and/or find new fuel for the Gecko Power plant"
  vlt_assault_concluded_badly_tt:0 "Unlocks decisions to try to fix your mistakes."
  vlt_aquire_a_new_fuel_source:0 "Find a New Fuel Source"
  vlt_aquire_a_new_fuel_source_desc:0 "After Broken Hills ran out of uranium we have mostly relied on our stockpiles and the rare trader that was willing to deal in the dangerous material. And we have honestly no idea how the Gecko ghouls kept the plant running as long as they did. But with it under our full control our stockpiles will be used up soon and then we would have to rely on the backup generator from the Vault again."
  vlt_gem_of_the_wasteland:0 "Gem of the Wasteland"
  vlt_out_with_the_old:0 "Out with the Old"
  vlt_out_with_the_old_desc:0 "A lot of the old institutions that were part of the infrastructure of Vault City are either outdated or not up to dealing with the new situation we are in. We need to consider which to keep and which to get rid off."
  vlt_new_amenities_office:0 "Merit Exchange Center"
  vlt_new_amenities_office_desc:0 "One of the jobs of the old Amenities Office was to give rewards for special tasks or extra efforts our citizens undertook. We should expand on this part of it's function, to keep the new influx of citizens motivated to work towards a common goal."
  vlt_new_servant_allocation_center:0 "Work Allocation Center"
  vlt_new_servant_allocation_center_desc:0 "Obviously the Servant Allocation Center has no use to us anymore, but the facility and systems in place can be repurposed. There is a lot more work to be done now that we are expanding and there is a lot more workforce available to us. The Work Allocation Center will help us to bring these two things together in hopefully the most efficient way possible."
  vlt_new_servant_allocation_center_tt:0 "This focus will either unlock the §YWork Allocation Center§! as a Major Business and grant you §G100§! political power, or if you already have chosen the §YServant Allocation Center§! swap it, giving you an effective change of §G+5%§! §YInfrastructure§!, §YAir§! and §YNaval Base§! Construction Speed."
  vlt_new_guards_on_duty:0 "New Guards on Duty"
  vlt_new_guards_on_duty_desc:0 "Our new batch of recruits in the Guard are in dire need of some training to work together in an organized fashion. Some of our earlier immigrants, although too old to fight directly on the front line, can train them in the ways of combat; and perhaps inspire others to join the Guard."
  vlt_new_guards_on_duty_tt:0 "When you recruit a new §YUnit Leader§! there is now a chance to recruit a §YWastelander§! instead of a §YVault Dweller§!."
  vlt_rooting_out_ghoul_sympathizers:0 "Rooting Out Ghoul Sympathizers"
  vlt_rooting_out_ghoul_sympathizers_desc:0 "Gordon, the ghoul envoy from Gecko, seems to be a prominent figure in a group that calls themselves the 'Cult of Renewal'. They teach some hokey superstitions about a universal cycle of renewal of all things and also support ghouls in Gecko and elsewhere. Gordon was never a particular welcome sight in Vault City anyway, so let's make this a bit more official by getting rid of him and his cultist friends."
  vlt_redefining_the_guard:0 "Redefining the Guard"
  vlt_redefining_the_guard_desc:0 "With a lot more men under the banner of the Guard, we can split up their responsibilities more. Until now a Guardsman was supposed to do anything. Patrol the outskirts of the city, protect the gates, prevent crime, respond to domestic issues, fight fires, fight wars. Now we have options."
  vlt_the_patrolmen:0 "The Patrolmen"
  vlt_the_patrolmen_desc:0 "The patrols tend to be one of the more dangerous jobs a guard has to do. It's hard for some of our citizens to even consider leaving the city's walls. But with some more hardy outworlder under our command, we can make the Patrolmen a permanent fixture. We actually would have the forces required to protect smaller factions and independent settlements that are in a friendly relationship with us."
  vlt_woop_woop_thats_the_sound_of_da_police:0 "A Domestic Police Force"
  vlt_woop_woop_thats_the_sound_of_da_police_desc:0 "Not every local incident requires sending in people with heavy armor and combat shotguns, especially in a relatively calm city like Vault City. Loud neighbours or a missing wallet usually require a different approach."
  vlt_a_proper_army:0 "A Proper Army"
  vlt_a_proper_army_desc:0 "Thanks to advice from some of our illustrious immigrnats, the City Guard is a professional military force in fact as well as name. The Let the term "City Guard" strike fear into the hearts of all who oppose us."
  vlt_criminal_empires:0 "Criminal Empires"
  vlt_criminal_empires_desc:0 "Considering how much the NCR touts itself to be safe and secure, there are a surprising amount of what we would consider 'Criminal Empires' between us and them. New Reno, the Den, the Yakuza. If we want this wasteland to be a better place, we need to start with them."
  vlt_hive_of_scum_and_villainy:0 "Challenge the Laws of Chance"
  vlt_hive_of_scum_and_villainy_desc:0 "The leadership of New Reno was always a rather tenuous thing, with multiple of the 'families' vying for power. It was only a matter of time until it came to a head. Now we need to deal with the consequences of that struggle, one way or the other."

  vlt_new_new_reno:0 "New Reno Tourism"
  vlt_new_new_reno_desc:0 "Despite the seedy underbelly of the city, it is a place built on the principle of entertainment. And some decent entertainment is something we are desperately lacking in Vault City itself. Now that it's safe to walk the streets of Reno again without being harassed by chem dealers and thugs, why not make a trip there to relax?"
  vlt_send_regards_to_the_oyabun:0 "Send Our Regards to the Oyabun"
  vlt_send_regards_to_the_oyabun_desc:0 "The Yakuza seem to be mostly reasonable folk, despite their criminal heritage. Maybe if we can give their Oyabun some gifts, we can get them to deal with some problems for us. Like the way less reasonable Vipers and Jackals."
  vlt_pest_control:0 "Pest Control"
  vlt_pest_control_desc:0 "Since the job of dealing with the raiders at our doorstep is either something the Yakuza are unwilling to do or something we don't trust them to do, it falls to us to get rid of them like the pests they are named after."
  vlt_another_mans_trash:0 "Another Man's Trash"
  vlt_another_mans_trash_desc:0 "Both Jackals and Vipers had control over a surprising amount of territory that they, unsurprisingly, barely utilised. There is so much useful materials just lying around it is staggering.\nLet us make use of what they did not."
  vlt_cultural_exchange:0 "Cultural Exchange"
  vlt_cultural_exchange_desc:0 "It's always hard arriving at a new place, where you don't now anybody. Especially if you are supposed to learn and work together with the people who have known each other forever. Let's all give our new Yakuza friends a warm welcome!"
  vlt_cultural_exchange_tt:0 "Two units of §YYakuza Exchange Students§! spawn in Vault City."
  vlt_just_another_raider_gang:0 "Just Another Raider Gang"
  vlt_just_another_raider_gang_desc:0 "What could have been, if not an ally, at least a helping hand with turning this place into something you could call civilization, the Yakuza have proven to just be another raider gang. And they will share the fate of their ilk."
  vlt_like_reno_but_somehow_worse:0 "Like New Reno, But Somehow Worse"
  vlt_like_reno_but_somehow_worse_desc:0 "Imagine New Reno. Now imagine New Reno, but with way less, way worse casinos. Now imagine it with even more chems and a lot of slavery. Congratulations, what you see in your mind is the Den.\nIf New Reno was an issue, the Den definitely is."
  vlt_getting_rid_of_the_last_family:0 "Getting Rid of the Last Family"
  vlt_getting_rid_of_the_last_family_desc:0 "The Mordinos were among the most vile families of New Reno, even if some of our citizens once worked with them. Since their flight to the Den, they've stuck their greasy fingers in the Wasteland's slave trade. Now we must decide what to do with them."

  vlt_modoc_is_kinda_in_the_way:0 "The Modoc Staging Grounds"
  vlt_modoc_is_kinda_in_the_way_desc:0 "Modoc is a small farming town built on the edge of the former Modoc National Forest. Its has long been a stopover for caravans from Reno, and we've sometimes purchased brahmin there when no better options are available. But now our military, emboldened by the liberation of the East, turns towards Reno. What shall we do with this little hamlet?"
  vlt_winning_the_war_against_crime:0 "Winning the War Against Crime"
  vlt_winning_the_war_against_crime_desc:0 "This war was harder and more bloody than trading fire with unorganized raider scattered raider groups.\n But we learned our lessons. We have become stronger through this struggle."

  vlt_time_well_spent_desc:0 "Nevada is now a safer, more civilized place. A place worth living in. A place worth fighting for. If you are a human, that is.\nTime to appoint some §MMagistrates§! and get some work done."

  vlt_the_wilds_of_east_nevada_desc:0 "While the area to our west is generally considered to be civilized, if not necessarily peaceful, the east is an unorganized mess of frontier towns, tribes and raider hideouts."
  vlt_among_the_willows:0 "Among the Willows"
  vlt_among_the_willows_desc:0 "If the Elko Posse was any more organized, you maybe could group them together with the 'criminal empires' to the west. But as it currently stands they are a typical raider gang with illusions of grandeur. There have been rumours floating around of them gunning for Vault City, as laughable as that is. Let's squash these rumours. And while we are at it, squash the Posse too."
  vlt_finding_the_holdouts:0 "Finding the Holdouts"
  vlt_finding_the_holdouts_desc:0 "Some of the Posse are still hiding out in the hills. But we will bring them to justice and keep the people they oppressed free and safe."
  vlt_riding_shotgun:0 "Riding Shotgun"
  vlt_riding_shotgun_desc:0 "The Buckaroos claim they are just humble ranchers, keeping the tradition alive. In reality though, most of the livestock they keep was stolen from various settlements in the area, to sell them for more profit or use them for their products. Expanding into the area will help their victims, but also gives access to a reasonably fertile area and all the livestock that isn't claimed by anyone else."
  vlt_corral_the_herds:0 "Corral the Herds"
  vlt_corral_the_herds_desc:0 "One consequence that we did not foresee, was that while the Buckaroos were large scale cattle rustlers, their presence was also \"protecting\" the area from various smaller raider groups that were preying on the regular folks instead of their livestock. That protection is now gone and we need to do something about that."
  vlt_contacting_eastport:0 "Contacting Eastport"
  vlt_contacting_eastport_desc:0 "Eastport is a loose community of settlements with an oddly chosen name. Their claim to fame is a working pre-war brewery and the sale of it's products. They have reported an increase in the sightings of [EHT.GetName] road warriors driving around the area over the last couple months. We should establish a military presence there as quickly as we can.

  vlt_the_cutest_fur_trade:0 "The Cutest Fur Trade"
  vlt_the_cutest_fur_trade_desc:0 "These critters were surprisingly obnoxious to fight against. The whole area was filled with traps and tunnels allowing them to move freely, while we were hindered at every step.\nAt least we got something out of our efforts.

The faded sign on a wall was proudly proclaiming \"Palikoi Geothermal - A Subsidiary of Poseidon Energy\". The power plant in front of them clearly showed some of the ravages of time, but it was built to last. The complex itself will be invaluable to us, not to mention the knowledge hidden within."

  vlt_secrets_withint_secrets_desc:0 "The forested area the furry mutants called their home was an oddity in itself. Despite being surrounded by wasteland it could almost be called a jungle.

  vlt_how_the_east_was_won_desc:0 "It might not have been a victory in the face of insurmountable odds, but for what was just a few years ago barely more than a city, this campaign was a huge accomplishment. We showed the world that we can stand on our own and that no raiders, imperialists or mutants will bring us down.\nAs it stands now, we are hardly just a city anymore.

  vlt_winnemucca_hub:0 "Winnemucca Hub"
  vlt_winnemucca_hub_desc:0 "Winnemucca is already an outpost that we had established a while ago, but it's position lends itself perfectly as a hub for incoming and outgoing traffic to and from Vault City.

Lynette married a senator from the NCR, dealt with the Chosen One, and welcomed refugees who needed a new home after their base off the coast of California got \"blown up in an act of terrorism\" as they claimed.

The engineers were there to quickly erect some buildings and walls to house the soldiers, then left. The soldiers though were here to stay in a permanent garrison just right outside our walls. \n\nBack then the rising threat of raiders was more than our guards could handle and the NCR was here to help.\nObviously the NCR's involvement was not completely altruistic in nature. They clearly wanted to bring us into their fold and this was their first step.\n\nBut the expected big push from the raiders never came. And neither did the NCR's, for various reasons.\n\nBut still the garrison remained. The soldiers were rotated out in regular intervals, but over time it became noticeable that with every rotation their equipment became worse. Outdated weapons in sometimes atrocious condition and lacking essential supplies. What also became worse was the... character of the average soldier. Drunken brawls that needed to be broken up regularly by our guards. Brawls that should not have happened in the first place if some of the soldiers didn't also smuggle in alcohol, cigarettes and sometimes even chems through the gates with their shipments from the NCR.\n\nBut at that point, even with the raiders being less of a threat, a lot of our defence has become reliant on these soldiers. And just ousting the garrison would not go over well with our 'friends' in the NCR."

  nf_vault_city.5.d:0 "Maier's insistence to involve the regular citizens in this years selection for the new First Citizen has made this a way longer process than it usually is. Normally the decision is made reasonably quickly and away from the public eye in the council building, by an unanimous vote from the council members. No public speeches, not trying to get the average citizen behind you. And while the council will still have the final word on the decision, Maier got his will and the decision will be heavily influenced by public opinion. Half a year after the announcement of this years selection, it is time for the council to convene."
  nf_vault_city.5.a:0 "The Votes Are In"

  nf_vault_city.6.d:0 "Even though Maier's insistence that the people would want change, they are clearly very comfortable with the current situation. This was proven when Lynette was appointed for her second term as the First Citizen of Vault City. She gave a short speech in the Downtown park area, thanking her supporters and giving promises of great things for Vault City in the future."
  nf_vault_city.6.a:0 "Five More Years!"

  nf_vault_city.7.t:0 "The Result"
  nf_vault_city.7.d:0 "The results of this years selection proved Maier's hunch, that the people of Vault City are not satisfied with the current situation, right. He was surrounded by a large amount of citizens in the Downtown park, being congratulated for his victory. He wanted to get some words in, a speech he had prepared in advance for this day, thanking his supporters and his husband, but the celebrations gave him no opportunity to come to word. Deciding to just go with the flow of the event, he was at least secure in his belief that he did the right thing."

  nf_vault_city.8.t:0 "The Result"
  nf_vault_city.8.d:0 "You would think that there was a procedure for the type of result that came out of this years selection. But there isn't. This is the first time in the recorded history of Vault City that the decision of the council on who would become the next First Citizen was tied. Normally the council members' vote would be almost unanimous, but the split opinion of the citizens was reflected in the council members and none of them felt the need to budge from their position. So instead of celebrations and speeches, the evening was spend with the council members and their aides digging through records and law texts, trying to find a solution.\nBut there was none to be found."

  nf_vault_city.9.d:0 "It has been a week now. Nothing has changed. The council members still won't agree on a new First Citizen and no solution to the situation was found. The citizens of Vault City are starting to become scared and angry. While the First Citizen usually does not affect day to day proceedings of the average citizen, the position has been an institution and a cornerstone of Vault Cities structure for almost 75 years. For many the absence of a First Citizen is a portent of worse things in the future. How can Vault City be an example of civilization in the wasteland, if it can't even get something as simple as a vote right?"

One evening in the Parlour Room after maybe one drink too many, Gordon of Gecko, the usually barely tolerated ghoul attaché from Gecko, was giving a speech. \nThis was not the unexpected part. \nThe unexpected part was that people started to listen.\n\nHe talked about Vault City becoming a second rate power instead of the utopia it is supposed to be, about falling more and more behind new emerging players.\nAbout half their citizens spending more time in the back and forth of paperwork and the red tape of bureaucracy instead of accomplishing anything of worth. As was made clear by the current situation. \nThat they need to recapture the essence of the evolutionary spirit that got them so far, to get it right before they'll get eliminated.\n\nPeople listened."

  nf_vault_city.11.t:0 "Something New"
  nf_vault_city.11.d:0 "The 'movement' took a bit to get going, but once people started to actually listen to Gordon, they noticed he was quite charismatic (for a ghoul) and what he said made a lot of sense. The same place where a couple weeks ago both Lynette and Maier held speeches to secure their spot in the limelight, now Gordon stood holding similar speeches.\nAbout how Vault City needed a different direction, a different outlook on things.\nAbout how the councilmen might grumble and wing, but they are only representatives of the peoples' will. And the people want something new.\n\nA Renewal, you might say."
  nf_vault_city.11.a:0 "Renewal? Sounds familiar."

  nf_vault_city.12.d:0 "It was not quite a revolution in the traditional sense. But when the large majority of your citizens urges you to select a candidate you have to consider your position. Even if that candidate was not actually part of the initial First Citizen hopefuls. Even if that candidate is a ghoul, of all things. But he was nominatively a citizen of Vault City and all citizens had the right for a chance of becoming First Citizen, regardless of background.\nThey stalled for a bit citing research of the respective law texts, but with the precedence set by Lynette's and Maier's unusual approach of public campaigns to win the Selection it was only a matter of time.\n\nIn the end they announced that Gordon of Gecko would be the new First Citizen of Vault City. First to be done so by public vote. First to hold this position that was not born in Vault City. First ghoul."

Lynette supports ghoul rights and advocates stronger ties with the NCR, hoping to be a good influence upon the Wasteland. While Vault City should remain aloof, it can be a light unto the Wastes, above the filth and muck that threaten so much.\n\nBut not everyone is happy with this system. Maier, the hero of the Guard, has adopted the views of the NCR. Maier believes the strength of the NCR comes from its people, and that Vault City can be the nucleus for a new, free Nevada. Maier's parents immigrated to Vault City in the 2240's, and he has adopted some of their ideals.

For should we not rally behind a government of laws, and not of men?' \n\nBut, to be fair, there are many criticisms to be made of the Garrison. Its soldiers are, ah, some of the more unorthodox of the republic. They are underequipped, due to the struggles down south.  Whatever protection they once provided is now little more than a Richardson village. We should expel the garrison, and stand on a firmer footing. \n\nPerhaps there is a third option, however.

For as long as [MOD.GetName] has existed, we have defended our freedom against aggression from raiders, criminal gangs and even pressure from the NCR.

Initial guesses were a natural spring that got unearthed during the war, but what was found was way more fantastical. The stream seemed to originate from a hollow root, exposed to air and broken open. But it wasn't a primitive piping system made by the critters.

The cathode projector started up with a electric buzz.\nEveryone was speculating what they would see.\nAlien landscapes?\nMaybe sights beyond our understanding?\n\n\"Is that a §PSlocum's Joe?!§\""
  nf_vault_city.250.a:0 "That was slightly anticlimactic."
  nf_vault_city.251.t:0 "Different Place, Same Slocum's Joe"
  nf_vault_city.251.d:0 "It was indeed a Slocum's Joe. Specifically one on the Commercial Street, between French and Elm Street, of the sleepy pre-war town of Higgins, Texas. Just a bit west of the border to Oklahoma. Well, the ruins of it. Both Slocum's Joe and Higgins, that is.\nThe camera feed from the Mr. Handy showed only destroyed buildings and no discernable sigs of life. The area seemed to have been mostly picked clean long ago by scavengers and obviously was found unworthy of habitation.\nSo why was there a a gateway created by psychic emanations between the Bonedancers Red Forest and this place? There had to be a reason for this. Something was receiving the psychic \"signal\" for lack of better terms. One of the sensors they had installed on the Mr. Handy was picking of something outside the usual spectrum. They send him in the general direction of it, often having to triangulate the weak readings. Until they hid the Watonga Correctional Facility. There the readings went off the charts. Whatever it was, they clearly had found it.\nThen something bashed the Mr. Handy in the head, destroying one of his sensor eyes. The camera feed showed something one of the scientist called 'Zombie'. Which caused some exclamations about racism from some ghouls in attendance. Until the scientist, quite clearly embarrassed, explained that he meant the pre-war concept off zombie, popularized through movies.\nAnd while the scientist and the few ghouls who actually remembered said movies had an avid discussion about some of those movies, the Mr. Handy was torn to pieces by said zombies.\nBut they had the coordinates of the place. And after some tests with molerats, it was deemed safe to send people through the anomaly."

It's not quite floating islands or ancient cyclopean structures, but this is way more interesting than the ruins of some pre-war donut store franchise.\nBut that's not what we are here for. We are here for whatever directed the psychic energy this way.\nSome more reconnaissance told us what we could see was located on the western coast of what used to be the Mexican Territory.Listening to recordings (technically: a translation of said recordings) made of chatter of locals in a nearby town, we found out the likely reason of the anomalies location. The leader of the [ATE.GetName] as they call themselves seems to have the ability of precognition.\nWhile that seems to be mostly harmless in itself, we can't take any risks."

The rescue of a merchants daughter, foiling an ambush, a curse from a tribal shaman. An epic struggle with summoned spirits and the eventual defeat of the spirits and the shaman who called them at the hand of a green lightning during a radstorm, as if the gods themselves were angry.\n§o\"All in all, an interesting weakened.§!\" said Zomak.\n\nNot that it was the only thing he brought with him from his travels.

Some citizens have claimed to have seen him with the arm of a mirelurk, others say it was a giant claw. Occasionally the arm appears to be missing, though Zomak claims he can still tough things with it, proving it by \"holding\" a bottle of Roentgen Rum with it, before drinking it in one go.\n§o\"Oh, you know, the usual.§!\" he says, when asked about how he got the strange limb.\n§o\"Blew up a nuclear bomb up north before it could be used to kill helpless villagers.

Of course i walked through it, who wouldn't?\nSo there i was looking like i do now, in a city maybe 6 years or so before the bombs dropped. Man did i get some weird looks. But you won't believe how fast people get used to the mutated freak.\nAnyway, i briefly toyed with the idea of maybe preventing the war, but I've seen enough science fiction in my time to be aware of paradox. So i didn't even bother.\nInstead i did something i always wanted to do, but never managed before the war. Get my master's degree.\nLuckily the university i enrolled accepted my bachelor's degree i managed to get the first time around. Took some convincing that the handsome guy on the ID they had filed indeed looked like this now. Couple years later, i hold my Master's dissertation. If you are interested the topic was 'Non-Renewable Resources Before and After a Nuclear War'.\"§!\n\nNobody was interested. What they were interested in was the location of said arch, which seems to be a time machine.

The book itself was a heavy leatherbound book, with a long gash diagonally across the front, like an open wound. Zomak says he added some chains around it after a while because 'it tends to open by itself otherwise' as he claims.\n§o\"Anyway, there i was, somewhere in the north east of the good old United States. And for some reason my new appearance made some local crazy people think I am their 'chosen one'. I tried to explain to them that i was pretty sure that name was already taken by a guy out west, but they would not listen to me. Push came to shove and they dragged me down into some temple i guess? All black stone and weird lights that have no discernable source. Oh and an altar of course. Can't be a proper temple to some alien god without that.\"§!\nA rather haggard looking outlander listening to this story nods in agreement.\n§o\"So, looks like their chosen one is chosen not to do some great deed, but to be the vessel of their deity. Of course i like my mind intact and my body under my control, so i fought them off. Turns out cultist knives are not that great when your opponent has a fully automatic gun at his disposal. Then they started summoning tentacles. Ugh.\"§!\n\"§cI hate when that happens. Tentacle goop is so hard to get rid our of your clothes.\"§! the haggard man adds to the story.\n§o\"This guy knows what I'm talking about. Get this man a drink. I'm paying.\"§!\nFurther questions about what that book exactly was and why he is still keeping it around were drowned out by both Zomak and the haggard man starting to laugh over a shared drink (followed by more drinks) and even more outlandish tales of their adventures."
