  VLT_FIRST_CITIZEN_LYNETTE_NAME: "First Citizen Lynette"
  VLT_FIRST_CITIZEN_LYNETTE_DESC: "Daughter of the the First Citizen who met the Chosen One, Lynette stands in stark contrast to her mother. Lynette studied in the Boneyard, and is more than willing to work with the NCR, Followers, or even ghouls. Lynette wishes to give a hand up to the peoples of Nevada, educating and guiding them towards a civilized lifestyle. Some of her critics have mocked her pacifist ways, but she thinks the only way for Vault City to remain a beacon of learning is to set an example for the Wasteland. \n\nBut Lynette has no desire to join the NCR. Vault City would disappear like ink in brahmin milk; it would do far better, in her opinion, to set an example as a light for the world."
  VLT_FIRST_CITIZEN_MAIER_NAME: "Security Chief Maier"
  VLT_FIRST_CITIZEN_MAIER_DESC: "Security Chief Brian Maier is descended from immigrants to Vault City in the 2240's, and like those refugees, fights to protect civilization. Maier has travelled the Wastes protecting his homeland's interests, and understands that Nevada needs a firm, guiding hand for orderly development. Maier has fought super-mutants, feral ghouls, and raiders, and has seen the corruption of the NCR first-hand. Any further involvement with the NCR will merely, in his eyes, lead to the strangulation of the last, best hope for peace, and he has become increasingly influential over time. For Maier is beloved by the other members of the Guard, and has risen high in their ranks. And he now prepares to take the necessary steps to save Vault City from all enemies, foreign and domestic."

  VLT_CHAD_RANNOR_NAME: "Chad Rannor"
  VLT_CHAD_RANNOR_DESC: "Rannor is one of the immigrants to Vault City in the last thirty years. A sergeant in the Guard, he is somehow more effective than the Captain himself. NCR attempts to find more details about where, exactly, he served have been stymied by the Vault City bureaucracy, but he will gladly take up his laser rifle for his home."
