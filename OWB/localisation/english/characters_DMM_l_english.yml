  DMM_GRISTLE_DESC:0 "Gristle is an icon of the power and prestige that The Dammed once enjoyed in and around the lakes of Manitoba. With control over the Grand Rapids Generating Station now contested by Nunavut, The Damned can no longer produce enough power for their populace nor easily trade between Lakes Manitoba and Winnipegosis. Import fees through Three Rivers choke out the last link between the east and west shorelines, leaving Gristle forced to make shady deals with even shadier hunters or risk starvation and revolt."
