  nf_des.1.t:0 "Rejecting the Unification Treaty"
  nf_des.1.d:0 "2271 was the year that the NCR and Desert Rangers unified into a single organization, bent on protecting the best interests of the people of the wasteland.\nAt least, some would say.\n\nFor Abigail Lee, that was something she could never abide by. To her, the idea that the Desert Rangers would surrender their sovereignty, that they would turn a blind eye to any innocent just based on their nationality was repulsive.\nOver time, she began to become emboldened by her views - watching as innocents died in Brotherhood raids deep into NCR territory, how raiders continued probing into the frontiers of the NCR’s territory, cities like Shady Sands and New Reno turning a blind eye to the evil’s of the world.\n\nTaking on the mantle of the Rogue Ranger - the Ranger that defied the Unification Treaty and sought to stand by her ideals, no matter what - Abigail gathered a small group of fellow rangers and traveled to the wasteland of Esmeralda, hoping to make a difference in a way that she couldn’t under the banner of a corrupt government."
  nf_des.1.a:0 "Evil's out there, we just have to find it."

  nf_des.2.t:0 "Establishing Outpost Mesa"
  nf_des.2.d:0 "Right on the border of NCR territory, the former county of Esmeralda was to be the home of the Rogue Ranger and her follower's base of operations - Outpost Mesa. While some say that it would be better if we fought against the greater evils of the wasteland, such as the Legion ultimately it is those small evils that we must watch for. Those that lurk in the shadows and strike against those who have nobody else to defend them. That is why the Rogue Ranger first went to Esmeralda, to defend the helpless and fight back against those who would strike at them."
  nf_des.2.a:0 "Hopefully the NCR will leave us alone.."

  nf_des.3.t:0 "The Strange Broadcast"
  nf_des.3.d:0 "Every day, on every radio and television in the county only one channel would be active, and only one show would be on 24/7 - Carousel. Carousel is a strange show, showing the lives of strange machine-people as they about their fake-days, living little facimilies of human life. They weren't very good actors, very often actors breaking down on set and needing to be replaced. Still, the sight of those machines gave the Rogue Ranger a curious thought - what sort of evil could be orchestrating something like this?"
  nf_des.3.a:0 "Wickedness knows no bounds."

  nf_des.4.t:0 "A Challenge to the Rogue Ranger!"
  nf_des.4.d:0 "With a big iron on his hip, a stranger would ride into Mesa atop the apolstery of a Cadillac. Calling himself Snake Vargas, he claims to represent those among the Rogue Rangers who feel that Abigail has gone too far in her rejection of the treaty, that - given enough time - she might even risk a civil war in the Rangers themselves! Vargas has challenged the Rogue Ranger to a old fashioned standoff!"
  nf_des.4.a:0 "This should be good.."

  nf_des.5.t:0 "The Standoff"
  nf_des.5.d:0 "Abigail stepped out of the saloon, holding tight her pistol as she approached the dirt highway of the old Mesa road. Vargas looked on from a distance. Both felt what they were doing was right, but only one would walk away alive this day. Who would draw first?"
  nf_des.5.a:0 "The Hero of Esmeralda."
  nf_des.5.b:0 "The Ranger with a big iron on his hip."

  nf_des.6.t:0 "Abigail Stands Tall"
  nf_des.6.d:0 "It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round, ultimately Abigail would shoot first. This victory - in tandedm with those against the other foes of Esmeralda - would cement the Rogue Ranger as the true embodiment of heroism!"
  nf_des.6.a:0 "Shows him."

  nf_des.7.t:0 "Abigail's End"
  nf_des.7.d:0 "It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round. There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground. Oh she might have went on living but she made one fatal slip When she tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip.\n\nIt would only take a night for Vargas to cement himself as the new leader of the Rogue Ranger's, cowboy diplomacy winning out as he proceeded to try to put the Rogue Ranger's on a new course - one that would have them reconsider their previous ways, see the darkness that lurked just at the end of their gun barrels."
  nf_des.7.a:0 "Can't fight human nature.."
