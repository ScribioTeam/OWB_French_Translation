  CARTEL_EMILIA_NAME:0 "Emilia Sinaloa"
  cartel_emilia_cultural_advisor:0 "Born to dirt-poor peasants and sold to the cartel for a pouch of caps, Emilia's life has been one of complete upheaval. Displaying an aptitude for violence at a young age, Emilia quickly became a top Sicario in the Sinaloa cartel, her youthful appearance belying a vicious spirit. The Queen Regent of the cartel soon took notice, and placed the firebrand under her ward, introducing Emilia to the world of cutthroat politics and diplomacy. Emilia soon won the respect and fear of the cartel hierarchy, and after a successful stint in the heart of the Aztlani empire, was designated the heir of the Sinaloa cartel. While this honour was originally given as a formality due to the almost entirely ghoul leadership, Emilia has continued to consolidate power amongst the tenientes, and it may just be possible that one day a smoothskin will be calling the shots in Sinaloa."
