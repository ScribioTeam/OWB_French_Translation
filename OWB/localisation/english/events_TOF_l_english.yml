  nf_tof.1.d:0 "When rebellion came to Farfield the soldiers of New Canaan were there to put an end to it, crushing the resistance and restoring order to the city. In the aftermath however, the city was left with the question of what to do with those rebels who had survived the battle. Summary executions would have been against everything the Canaanites stood for, and so instead it was decided the defeated would need to repent and repay the community for their sins.

Marianne then called in as many favors as she could to practically become the leader of the chaotic prison gang overnight.
