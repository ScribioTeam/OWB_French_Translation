  ship_medium_weapon_module_1:0 "Naval Ballistae"
  ship_medium_weapon_module_1_desc:0 "A heavy bolt thrower, the ballistae let our crew fire accurately over long distance with it's relatively high velocity, and inflict heavy damage with it's much wider and heavier projectiles."
  ship_medium_weapon_module_2:0 "57mm Deck Cannon"
  ship_medium_weapon_module_2_desc:0 "A 57mm cannon with a simple screw breech loading system, it fires heavy projectiles containing close to 250 grams of explosive, more than enough to blow open even light iron armour."
  ship_medium_weapon_module_3:0 "57mm Revolver Cannon"
  ship_medium_weapon_module_3_desc:0 "Now equipped with a revolving autocannon design, as well as improved ammunition, this impressive weapon can fire 8 shells per second in burst from a belt-feed, cracking open vessels in seconds."
  ship_medium_weapon_module_4:0 "Plasma Discharger"
  ship_medium_weapon_module_4_desc:0 "Even though bore is hardly applicable to a plasma weapon, if it was applied here it would be close to 200mm. Firing a huge two-stage shell, they each transform into a superheated ball of plasma once in contact with the enemy."

  ship_heavy_mounted_gun_module:0 "Four Mounted Guns"
  ship_heavy_mounted_gun_module_desc:0 "Weaponry usually fitted to heavy-class naval assets"
  ship_heavy_weapon_module_1:0 "Naval Catapult"
  ship_heavy_weapon_module_1_desc:0 "A siege engine with it's design dating way back, this particular weapon has been refitted with some... unconventional projectile. Firing what amounts to aerodynamic TNT barrel, an external fuze and good math skills brings death to the enemy in a huge explosion."
  ship_heavy_weapon_module_2:0 "75mm Deck Cannon"
  ship_heavy_weapon_module_2_desc:0 "With a huge TNT filling, and some extensive physical training for the gunnery crew, this weapon can punch holes in any ship of it's class, and seriously injure anything even heavier.."
  ship_heavy_weapon_module_3:0 "75mm Revolver Cannon"
  ship_heavy_weapon_module_3_desc:0 "Improvements in shell design and loading technology let this armoured turret fire a 75mm heavy APHE shell at around 80 rounds per minute, making it a devastating ballistic weapon."
  ship_heavy_weapon_module_4:0 "Microwave Lance"
  ship_heavy_weapon_module_4_desc:0 "A huge directed energy weapon taking it's energy from microfusion shells, it can blast an enemy ship with the same heat a thermonuclear explosion would release at it's shock-wave stage."

  ship_super_heavy_weapon_module_1:0 "Naval Trebuchet"
  ship_super_heavy_weapon_module_1_desc:0 "A counterweight trebuchet using a heavy load to swing a catapult arm, this particular weapon has been armed with an even heavier aerodynamic explosive shell."
  ship_super_heavy_weapon_module_2:0 "90mm Deck Cannon"
  ship_super_heavy_weapon_module_2_desc:0 "Heavy hardened shells filled to the brim with explosives and lobbed from a 90mm main gun is the heaviest ballistic weaponry we can currently field, though i doubt more is needed."
  ship_super_heavy_weapon_module_3:0 "90mm Twin Cannon"
  ship_super_heavy_weapon_module_3_desc:0 "Semi-fixed shells with provision for much higher muzzle velocity, increased explosive filling and better aiming devices let us annihilate entire ships in a single mighty blow."
  ship_super_heavy_weapon_module_4:0 "Railgun"
  ship_super_heavy_weapon_module_4_desc:0 "With variable projectile velocity settings going as far as 2,000 meter per second, this weapon can either penetrate a heavy ship from bow to stern, or simply explode inside a ship's side armour, showering the inside with fragments."

  light_ship_subsurface_module_1:0 "Naval Ram"
  light_ship_subsurface_module_1_desc:0 "A thick reinforced spear at the prow of our light ship as well as special crew training for proper naval close-combat should help the crew of our light ships take on larger foes. In addition, equipping our crew with a mix of heavy pistols and melee weapons instead of the usual light side arm will give them an edge."
  medium_ship_subsurface_module_1:0 "Naval Ram"
  medium_ship_subsurface_module_1_desc:0 "Our medium ships hit the threshold where nothing more than just a ram is necessary. After all, ramming most ships of equal or lighter tonnage would already provoke heavy damage or even destroy the keel itself. Reinforcing the prow is all that's needed to have our medium crafts able to damage heavier vessels as well."
  heavy_ship_subsurface_module_1:0 "Naval Ram"
  heavy_ship_subsurface_module_1_desc:0 "While we manufacture one of the heaviest class of warship in the wasteland, there is still the possibilities that we will encounter bigger. For such an eventuality, and to deal with lesser crafts much quicker, we installed a reinforced wooden ram on our heavy ships with a sharpened edge and wide base to broaden any breach in an enemy hull."
  super_heavy_ship_subsurface_module_1:0 "Naval Ram"
  super_heavy_ship_subsurface_module_1_desc:0 "Our heavy ships are very well armed, but taking time to engage and destroy lesser assets slows down even more the already steady pace they move at. The sheer weight of our warship provides a simple answer, a wooden naval ram the size of the prow will simply smash through any ship in our way."
  light_ship_subsurface_module_2:0 "Composite Ram"
  light_ship_subsurface_module_2_desc:0 "To assist our light ships in taking out heavier targets, a simple spear wasn't enough. The advent of more stable explosive fillings and better alloy lets us install an easily removable Bangalore spear. Explosive charges at the tip, an impact fuze and an aluminium construction will blow a hole through medium and even heavy armour with a bit of luck."
  medium_ship_subsurface_module_2:0 "Composite Ram"
  medium_ship_subsurface_module_2_desc:0 "While rams are sufficient, new and thicker armour is sure to be installed on enemy heavy crafts. For such an eventuality, our engineers devised a very effective system. The prow is reinforced with steel and a ram juts out from the tip. A gun barrel runs from the tip of the ram to the interior hull of our ship, all linked to a pressurized pneumatic device and simple breech. The ram will breach the enemy hull and from then our crew can fire fragmentation shells directly into the enemy hull for extreme internal damage, shredding personnel and destroying most internal modules outright."
  heavy_ship_subsurface_module_2:0 "Composite Ram"
  heavy_ship_subsurface_module_2_desc:0 "Manufacturing a new ram in face hardened armour steel with a much better edge and thicker base should split most enemy crafts in half upon impact"
  super_heavy_ship_subsurface_module_2:0 "Composite Ram"
  super_heavy_ship_subsurface_module_2_desc:0 "To improve such a huge ram comes down more to it not deteriorating as much from multiple impacts than to redesign it for more damage. The enemy crafts are still almost completely obliterated on impact but the ram should withstand more than half a dozen of them."
  light_ship_subsurface_module_3:0 "Torpedoes"
  light_ship_subsurface_module_3_desc:0 "Fitting the Bangalore system with a miniaturized engine and a propeller lets our light crafts engage enemy ships a class above both stealthily and from a safe distance. A proximity fuze to have it explode directly under the enemy will give a nasty surprise to anyone taking our screening fleet for an easy target."
  medium_ship_subsurface_module_3:0 "Torpedoes"
  medium_ship_subsurface_module_3_desc:0 "While the previous system was effective, the critical flaw was range. To engage enemies without needing to close in as combat distances get farther and farther, a propeller and electric engine is fitted to a thick naval torpedo filled to the brim with military-grade explosives. Such weaponry allows us to take on even heavy-class ships."
  heavy_ship_subsurface_module_3:0 "Torpedoes"
  heavy_ship_subsurface_module_3_desc:0 "The easiest part of explosive engineering is getting it to blow up. The hardest part is getting it to blow up at the right time. Underwater torpedoes using a directed explosive blast instead of a spread one will blow giant holes in even the thickest hulls and even lift smaller vessels clean off from the sheer impact of such weaponry."
  super_heavy_ship_subsurface_module_3:0 "Torpedoes"
  super_heavy_ship_subsurface_module_3_desc:0 "While making an object dedicated to exploding expensive or costly would be an exercise in futility, we can improve other factors without needed to refit and replace components every launch. A sub-surface sonar apparatus can scan the bottom of enemy vessels and provide targeting data directly to our torpedoes via uplink. Such a system allows a salvo of them to be fired, placed right under an enemy's keel and explode at the same time, generally resulting in catastrophic structural damage and fist-bumping from the torpedo crew."

  light_ship_armour_module_1:0 "Light Wooden Hide"
  light_ship_armour_module_1_desc:0 "While speed is essential, our screening vessel should still have some amount of armour. Enough to resist pistol fire and light naval projectiles should let our crews get on with their screening duties more safely."
  medium_ship_armour_module_1:0 "Medium Wooden Hide"
  medium_ship_armour_module_1_desc:0 "Medium ships need a balance of speed and armour which is not easily achieved. Still, this armour will protect us against most small arms fire and medium naval projectile we might encounter, just don't expect it to resist HMG fire."
  heavy_ship_armour_module_1:0 "Heavy Wooden Hide"
  heavy_ship_armour_module_1_desc:0 "Heavy ships can easily mount thick armour. One such made from the sturdiest wood possible and treated further for resilience can resist even ballistic weaponry such as light autocannons."
  super_heavy_ship_armour_module_1:0 "Superheavy Wooden Hide"
  super_heavy_ship_armour_module_1_desc:0 "More akin to a floating castle than a ship, our superheavy hulls are armoured with a staggering quantity of treated wood that can even stop light cannons such as 37mm."

  light_ship_armour_module_2:0 "Light Ironclad Hide"
  light_ship_armour_module_2_desc:0 "While we cannot further increase the armour of our light ship, we can make it much more efficient. A wooden backing with a thin wrought iron plate will stop most small arms projectiles as well as some weapons deployed by enemy screening assets."
  medium_ship_armour_module_2:0 "Medium Ironclad Hide"
  medium_ship_armour_module_2_desc:0 "Advance in engine technology allows us to keep the previous wooden armour while adding a wrought iron plate thick enough to withstand HMG fire by itself. Both combined will repel medium weaponry and some autocannons."
  heavy_ship_armour_module_2:0 "Heavy Ironclad Hide"
  heavy_ship_armour_module_2_desc:0 "To reduce cost on such massive hulls, the wooden backing was kept while a thick iron plate was bolted on top for protection. Cannon fire can now be repelled reliably, which should give our vessels a clear advantage in battle."
  super_heavy_ship_armour_module_2:0 "Superheavy Ironclad Hide"
  super_heavy_ship_armour_module_2_desc:0 "To clad such a vessel in such a way demands a huge amount of time. The sheer size of armour plates that can be as thick as a man is staggering to say the least, and the wooden backing will catch any projectile that damaged such armour."

  light_ship_armour_module_3:0 "Light Steel Hide"
  light_ship_armour_module_3_desc:0 "An all-steel construction with an aluminium backing is both lightweight and resistant, letting us engage larger enemies will less trouble than ever."
  medium_ship_armour_module_3:0 "Medium Steel Hide"
  medium_ship_armour_module_3_desc:0 "An entire redesign of our medium hull and extensive calculation to balance engine power and protection resulted in one of the most advanced steel armour yet. Further internal reinforcement to key components concludes our engineers' efforts"
  heavy_ship_armour_module_3:0 "Heavy Steel Hide"
  heavy_ship_armour_module_3_desc:0 "Our warships suffer from more and more targeted fire, and while our hull holds to enemy shells, they do not to repeated impacts. Thicker and more resistant face-treated steel will not break as easily, and lets our frontline crafts stay in the fight much longer."
  super_heavy_ship_armour_module_3:0 "Superheavy Steel Hide"
  super_heavy_ship_armour_module_3_desc:0 "Improving such armour comes down to internal reinforcement and redesign of the hull. The steel composition lets our superheavy crafts be as armoured as ever with lighter hulls, which will be the benediction of many engineers and supply crew. Internal armouring of such components as the engine and magazine will also increase overall protection."

  light_ship_armour_module_4:0 "Light Reinforced Hide"
  light_ship_armour_module_4_desc:0 "With face-hardening and full welding becoming possible, we can actually make our ships lighter while providing more protections. Reinforcement of key sub-sections such as the bridge and the engine room is welcomed, while wet storage for all ammunition depots is something every gun crew will thank us profusely for."
  medium_ship_armour_module_4:0 "Medium Reinforced Hide"
  medium_ship_armour_module_4_desc:0 "In addition to advanced welding and heat treating of the armour plate, we can now reinforce most sub-section of our ships with spall liners and other anti-fragmentation components to avoid any internal spalling on impact."
  heavy_ship_armour_module_4:0 "Heavy Reinforced Hide"
  heavy_ship_armour_module_4_desc:0 "The priority of our heavy armour development is to maintain the level of protection required by frontline combat while decreasing weight. A general improvement to the armour layout as well as much reinforced gun shields on more powerful powered mounts will protect our crew more efficiently while in the thick of battle."
  super_heavy_ship_armour_module_4:0 "Superheavy Reinforced Hide"
  super_heavy_ship_armour_module_4_desc:0 "Barely able to be scratched by most currently fielded naval weaponry, the focus is now turned on the only one that can. The torpedo. Redundant external bulkheads under the waterline and anti-torpedo bulge incorporates into the reinforced armouring scheme to make our ships as close to invincibility as they can get right now."

  light_ship_armour_module_5:0 "Light Composite Hide"
  light_ship_armour_module_5_desc:0 "The pinnacle of what we can equip our screening vessels with, it allows good speed with impressive protection. An aluminium alloy incorporated some distance away from the main armour will deform incoming projectiles, while an all new hardened steel alloy plate as main armour and a Kevlar backing acting as spall liners provides protection against even canons."
  medium_ship_armour_module_5:0 "Medium Composite Hide"
  medium_ship_armour_module_5_desc:0 "Further reinforcement of internal bulkheads as well as composite alloy and the integration of anti-torpedo side devices makes our medium armour truly modern, able to withstand most threats found on second-line duty."
  heavy_ship_armour_module_5:0 "Heavy Composite Hide"
  heavy_ship_armour_module_5_desc:0 "Thick torpedo bulges, more internal reinforcement to the infrastructure of the ship itself and a heavier composite alloy brings our level of protection to almost pre-war level, letting us withstand anything but the heaviest guns."
  super_heavy_ship_armour_module_5:0 "Superheavy Composite Hide"
  super_heavy_ship_armour_module_5_desc:0 "With previous upgrades focused on decreasing weight while improving efficiency, the advent of better propulsion has let our engineers go hog wild. Huge torpedo bulge, armour plates thicker than a behemoth and gun shields big enough to catch even cannon shot by themselves makes our vessel close to unsinkable. Even pre-war designers would be in awe at such a craft."

  light_ship_storage_module_1:0 "Storage Compartment"
  light_ship_storage_module_1_desc:0 "Compartments bolted to the sides of the hull and lightly armoured to withstand spall lets our screening vessels carry more equipment to the field"
  medium_ship_storage_module_1:0 "Storage Compartment"
  medium_ship_storage_module_1_desc:0 "A locking system and medium armour on large storage modules lets our sensitive equipment be protected from internal damage while increasing the amount we can carry safely."
  heavy_ship_storage_module_1:0 "Storage Compartment"
  heavy_ship_storage_module_1_desc:0 "A bulkhead-like door to a safe room as reinforced as other important sub-sections lets our equipment survive glancing blows and gives us increased storage capacity without having to put it somewhere vulnerable to water and fire damage."
  super_heavy_ship_storage_module_1:0 "Storage Compartment"
  super_heavy_ship_storage_module_1_desc:0 "More efficient storage in the centre of our armouring scheme as well as redundant storage system lets us lose a minimal amount of supply even on direct hits."
  light_ship_storage_module_2:0 "Advanced Storage Compartment"
  light_ship_storage_module_2_desc:0 "Lighter spall liners and aluminium alloy lets our crew handle storage modules much easier while providing better protection against flooding and ballistic projectiles."
  medium_ship_storage_module_2:0 "Advanced Storage Compartment"
  medium_ship_storage_module_2_desc:0 "Giving our storage modules a dedicated, reinforced hold in our crafts with efficient armouring and structural reinforcement will protect what makes our fleet able to fight."
  heavy_ship_storage_module_2:0 "Advanced Storage Compartment"
  heavy_ship_storage_module_2_desc:0 "Reinforced bulkheads against even the crushing force of a full-on internal flooding and emergency supply rooms scattered around the ships will let our crew breathe easy knowing medical supplies and ammunition are safely stored and close at any moment."
  super_heavy_ship_storage_module_2:0 "Advanced Storage Compartment"
  super_heavy_ship_storage_module_2_desc:0 "The sheer size of those crafts demand lessened time to access critical supplies at any moment. Reinforcing the core storage against catastrophic hits, scattered emergency stashes and lightweight spall-resistant supply boxes able to be carried around by the crew comfortably will let our seamen access such supplies easily and safely."

  light_ship_mines_module:0 "Mine Equipment"
  light_ship_mines_module_desc:0 "With the advent of naval mines and other maritime dangers, our light ships should more than ever be prepared for such eventualities. This module consists of a surprising but very effective upgrade. The engines are simply uprated and equipped with a supercharger system allowing impressive speed for short bursts. Our light vessels designed for shallow water then simply steam ahead full speed through a minefield, floating too high to be damaged. The resulting pressure wave detonates most if not all pressure mines present in their path. When they are out of range, of course."
  medium_ship_mines_module:0 "Mine Equipment"
  medium_ship_mines_module_desc:0 "Mines are tricky business for any naval operations, and often them combined with enemy naval assets keeps our screening crafts from their mine-clearing duties. Equipping a more armoured craft with an anti-mine net that detonates them on contact lets our craft go to their duties even under enemy fire."

  light_ship_torpedoes_module:0 "Torpedo Launcher"
  light_ship_torpedoes_module_desc:0 "Torpedoes require a more effective delivery system than a fixed hull-mounted tube. Having torpedo tubes on a swivelling turret mount and launched via intense pneumatic pressure directly into the water lets our crafts be more tactically flexible."

  ship_pd_module_1:0 "Coach Gun Point Defence"
  ship_pd_module_1_desc:0 "Elephant guns loaded with huge buckshot, these shotguns can easily shred airplane on a direct hit, and the amount of smoke created on firing will make any pilot think twice before attacking."
  ship_pd_module_2:0 "HMG"
  ship_pd_module_2_desc:0 "A 7.7mm machine-gun mounted on a swivel, and armed with incendiary ammunition, let our crews fill the sky with lead, and deter any airplane trying to dive-bomb the ship."
  ship_pd_module_3:0 "Twin-mount HMG"
  ship_pd_module_3_desc:0 "A twin-mounted HMG chambered in 12.7mm calibre, this much heavier anti-air weapon benefit from both increased damage and vastly increased range, allowing saturation fire on even powered monoplanes."
  ship_pd_module_4:0 "Krautmower"
  ship_pd_module_4_desc:0 "A powered and armoured turret armed with a quadruple 14.5mm machine-gun layout, all fed from multiple ship-bound ammo belt, will knock any plane out of the sky if hit, which is especially easy considering the staggering 30 rounds per second rate of fire."
  ship_pd_module_5:0 "20mm Autocannon"
  ship_pd_module_5_desc:0 "A dual 20mm autocannon setup in a lighter powered turret let our AA crew track enemy aircraft easier, and down them from increased range, which keeps most planes from even approaching heavily armed vessels."
  ship_pd_module_6:0 "20mm Rotary Autocannon"
  ship_pd_module_6_desc:0 "A 20mm rotary autocannon, firing close to a hundred high explosive projectile per second, can fill the sky with shrapnel and easily shred even armoured dirigible."
  ship_pd_module_7:0 "Point Defence Laser"
  ship_pd_module_7_desc:0 "A focused energy weapon firing at a microsecond scale, this powerful AA unit acquire and down enemy airplanes in second with it's pre-war computing unit and micro-fission power unit."

  ship_detection_module_1:0 "Seagull Scouts"
  ship_detection_module_1_desc:0 "Trained seagulls are an archaic but useful method of sighting and identifying enemy vessels at a distance. Few are the seamen that would think a simple seagull would announce a hail of gunfire, and complex communication between them and their handlers can even tell us what class of ships the enemy fields, letting us choose the best ammunition for the fight ahead."
  ship_detection_module_2:0 "Long Range Optics"
  ship_detection_module_2_desc:0 "Treated lenses array and handheld optical devices provides us with both a quick reconnaissance option and advanced identification capabilities. Also provides a few laughs to the crew when looking at the enemy ship when the heavy artillery gets a direct hit."
  ship_detection_module_3:0 "Radar Arrays"
  ship_detection_module_3_desc:0 "Primitive radar arrays and more advanced optical devices allows us to find enemy warships more easily. And while estimating the range by radar return alone is a somewhat lengthy process, it should also give us more accurate targeting data."
  ship_detection_module_4:0 "Advanced Radar Arrays"
  ship_detection_module_4_desc:0 "Advanced multi-pulsed and armoured radar arrays in conjunctions with coincidence rangefinder devices lets us detect even the smallest patrol boat and get accurate, real-time range data for our main guns."
  ship_detection_module_5:0 "Detection Avoidance Kits"
  ship_detection_module_5_desc:0 "Changing our entire hull pattern to diminish radar return would be a hopeless endeavour. Instead, a powered electronic device detects any radio wave emitted by radar arrays and emits a powerful multi-frequency barrage jam to feed garbage data to enemy crews. It can be modulated to make our warships appear smaller, bigger, or simply fill their entire screen with radar returns."

  ship_communications_module_1:0 "Messenger Seagulls"
  ship_communications_module_1_desc:0 "Trained seagulls are versatile creatures. Having carrier seagulls transporting messages between warships lets us coordinate with allied vessels much easier, letting us relay enemy sightings and faster naval path."
  ship_communications_module_2:0 "Signal Flags"
  ship_communications_module_2_desc:0 "With improved optics, we can now use trained flag operators and signal flag to drastically reduce the time between messages. The flag operators stressed multiple time the importance of developing new technology for communication, which might have something to do with them working even under fire on exposed parts of the ship."
  ship_communications_module_3:0 "Light Signals"
  ship_communications_module_3_desc:0 "Powerful spotlight and signal manuals let our crew communicate with other warships from protected enclosure, being able to relay with their own crew much faster at the same time while not being under enemy fire. The flag wavers have sent us a cask of alcohol, by the way."
  ship_communications_module_4:0 "Radio Communication"
  ship_communications_module_4_desc:0 "Radio devices and encrypted communication protocols let us install our signal crew deep within the ship, even more protected from enemy fire. Advanced equipment and proper relays to the command bridge improves our fleet coordination even more."
  ship_communications_module_5:0 "Visual Data Feeds"
  ship_communications_module_5_desc:0 "An advanced data feed scans at any time an all-around angle around the warship to provide the signal crew with immediate information on allied position, enemy position, incoming fire as well as tides and obstacles."

  ship_command_module_1:0 "Word of Mouth"
  ship_command_module_1_desc:0 "Messengers send to different parts of the ship lets our command crew have a much better view of the status of their vessels, such as supply problems, hull breach, whether the ship is utterly sinking or not and the various colourful insults the sailors have to say in the situation."
  ship_command_module_2:0 "String Telephones"
  ship_command_module_2_desc:0 "String telephones installed in critical sub-sections of the ship like the engine room and the engineering bay allows near instant communication between the crew and the captain of the vessel without the various inconsequential information random sailors would provide."
  ship_command_module_3:0 "Engine Order Telegraph"

  carrier_deck_module_2_desc:0 "More advanced steam-powered catapults allows us to launch heavier crafts while purpose-built refuelling and repair depot on the flight deck lessens the time between sortie."
  carrier_deck_module_3:0 "Mobile Hangar"
  carrier_deck_module_3_desc:0 "A storage space built directly into the central infrastructure of the carrier provides maximal protection to up to five advanced aircraft, while mobile platforms inside can easily transport planes from the refuelling and rearmament zone to the repair station or the flight deck."

  ship_light_harpoon_module:0 "Spec Ops Team"
  ship_light_harpoon_module_desc:0 "With our light vessels not allowing assault teams or close-range attack, we have to use finesse. Incorporating squad-sized spec ops teams with directed explosives, underwater weaponry and diving equipment into the ship's crew, we can blast holes in enemy hulls and infiltrate them, causing panic and striking swiftly at their command centre or engine room."
  ship_medium_harpoon_module:0 "Boarding Party"
  ship_medium_harpoon_module_desc:0 "Harpoons with powerful winch let our vessel attach themselves to enemy naval assets for boarding actions. Extensively trained marines clad in heavy armours and using automatic shotguns are then put into action, killing anyone standing in their way with a hail of 20 gauge shells and heavy pistol fire, clearing the ship as they go."
  ship_heavy_harpoon_module:0 "Speedboat Assault Team"
  ship_heavy_harpoon_module_desc:0 "Heavier vessels allow us to put into action daring boarding actions by having them carry speedboats into battle.

  ship_super_heavy_harpoon_module:0 "Dreadnought Boarding Team"
  ship_super_heavy_harpoon_module_desc:0 "Refitting our first, bulky power armour prototypes with belt-fed short weaponry makes them into awe-inspiring boarding teams. With very short battery life, they are rudimentary, but effective. The short battery life is much less of a problem when life or death is resolved in less than an hour, and getting into range via ramming makes deployment very easy."


 # Naval Tech Names

  naval_command_module_tech_4_desc:0 "An intercom system installed in the bridge and in critical sub-section as well as bulkhead sections makes our captain even more efficient in their task, letting them know in seconds what is happening around the ship via colourful sailor language."
  naval_command_module_tech_5:0 "Interlinked System"
  naval_command_module_tech_5_desc:0 "In addition to the intercom system, various sensors, temperature indicator, barometer and structural integrity detector will immediately display any breach, leak or unnatural results on various data screens in the command room and engineering bay, letting our crew react much faster."

  naval_communications_module_tech_1:0 "Messenger Seagulls"
  naval_communications_module_tech_1_desc:0 "Trained seagulls are versatile creatures. Having carrier seagulls transporting messages between warships allow us to coordinate with allied vessels much easier, letting us relay enemy sightings and faster naval path."
  naval_communications_module_tech_2:0 "Signal Flags"
  naval_communications_module_tech_2_desc:0 "With improved optics, we can now use trained flag operators and signal flag to drastically reduce the time between inter-ship communication.

  naval_communications_module_tech_4:0 "Radio Communication"
  naval_communications_module_tech_4_desc:0 "Radio devices and encrypted communication protocols let us install our signal crew deep within the ship, even more protected from enemy fire. Advanced equipment and proper relays to the command bridge improves our fleet coordination even more."
  naval_communications_module_tech_5:0 "Visual Data Feeds"
  naval_communications_module_tech_5_desc:0 "An advanced data feed provides constant visual feed and analysis of the warship's surrounding to give the signal crew immediate intel on allied position, enemy position, incoming fire, as well as tides and obstacles."

  naval_storage_module_tech_1:0 "Storage Compartment"
  naval_storage_module_tech_1_desc:0 "Equipping our fleet with storage compartments should increase their autonomy during patrol or combat."
  naval_storage_module_tech_2:0 "Reinforced Storage"
  naval_storage_module_tech_2_desc:0 "Reinforced storage, made out of hardened alloy, will let our vessels benefit from increased supplies that are protected from shrapnel, or flooding."

  naval_fire_protection_tech_1:0 "Fire Extinguisher"
  naval_fire_protection_tech_1_desc:0 "Providing multiple fire extinguishers in ready racks at critical locations throughout the ship will let any of our crew lend a hand in containing on-board fires. Those fire extinguisher consist of simple converted flamethrower units, projecting a foam compound onto the open flame, displacing oxygen and extinguishing most fires instantly."
  naval_fire_protection_tech_2:0 "Asbestos Lining"
  naval_fire_protection_tech_2_desc:0 "Applying an asbestos fireproof lining to important sub-sections such as the living quarters, bridges, and engineering deck, should reduce the risk of a spreading fire on the vessel. Asbestos being a miracle material completely resistant to fire, we can also use it as a coating agent for the rest of the ship as additional fireproofing measures."
  naval_fire_protection_tech_3:0 "Automated Fire Prevention System"
  naval_fire_protection_tech_3_desc:0 "Heat sensors and oxygen level readers are installed in most sub-sections, particularly in the engine compartment and magazine. All connected to multiple tanks containing powder-based agent, they automatically detect any fire, gauge it's severity, and disperse the compounds in the right quantity to extinguish the flames."

  naval_special_module_tech_1:0 "Mine Laying Equipment"
  naval_special_module_tech_1_desc:0 "As naval warfare becomes more and more of a concern, we have to manage our naval protection. While we may think of active measures such as ship patrols, the sheer size that needs to be patrolled has to be managed more efficiently. Naval mines filled with explosives and triggered by passing ships will help us protect our shore, and expertise with them will also let us develop minesweeping equipment."
  naval_special_module_tech_2:0 "Naval Mine Manufacturing"
  naval_special_module_tech_2_desc:0 "Naval mines are a very cheap alternative to patrol elements, allowing us to defend our shores against enemy ships with minimal efforts. Designing mines with a focus toward crew safety when laying, as well as reliability once in the water, will increase their service life, and decrease the rift they drift into... inconvenient areas."
  naval_special_module_tech_3:0 "Mine Tech 3"
  naval_special_module_tech_3_desc:0 "No effect"

  grappling_harpoon_module_tech:0 "Grappling Harpoon"
  grappling_harpoon_module_tech_desc:0 "Sometimes, there is the possibility the enemy is better equipped than us. What to do when our weapons are too weak to blast through their hull? The answer is simple. Ignore it entirely. With close quarter combat equipment issued to specialized boarding teams, we can board and ravage enemy vessels with superior firepower. All this at the cost of some additional risks for our boats to close in."
  metal_bows_tech:0 "Metal Bows"

  naval_special_tech_1:0 "Mine Module"
  naval_special_tech_1_desc:0 "Research into mining and demining procedures are a tricky business. It's always complicated to work with explosives powerful enough to blow an entire ship to kingdom come. But after many coffee jar, and many nervous breakdowns, our teams are finally able to present proper mine-laying and mine-defusing equipment. They apparently kindly request some vacation."

  naval_pd_module_tech_1:0 "Coach Guns"
  naval_pd_module_tech_1_desc:0 "Soldiers armed with coach guns scattered throughout the ship provide simple AA firepower against slow moving targets. Bigger propellant load in each shells as well as special powder creating a large black cloud on firing will both make them appear far deadlier than they are, throwing pilots off target, and will go straight through unarmoured cockpits in a hail of 10 gauge buckshot."
  naval_pd_module_tech_2:0 "Heavy Machine Guns"
  naval_pd_module_tech_2_desc:0 "A simple heavy machine gun adapted with a pintle mount and a removable AA sight gives our ships the means to shoot down low-flying aircraft."

Consequently, the practical rate of fire of our anti-air weapons are increased, and so is their chance to hit their targets."
  naval_pd_tech_2:0 "Internal Rotary Feeding System"
  naval_pd_tech_2_desc:0 "A bird-cage arrangement, consisting of an internal rotary drum, and using a piston-actuated extraction mechanism, massively increases the rate of fire of all currently field anti-air weaponry. Such a system gives our guns a fire rate upward of 30 rounds a second, shredding any enemy aircraft foolish enough to fly in gun range."

  naval_subsurface_module_tech_1:0 "Naval Ram"
  naval_subsurface_module_tech_1_desc:0 "Designed to puncture enemy hulls and provoke internal damage as well as breaches, those armoured prolongation of our prow should give our warships a way to damage enemy naval assets larger than them reliably, thus ensuring our vessels can stay relevant on the battlefield."
  naval_subsurface_module_tech_2:0 "Composite Ram"
  naval_subsurface_module_tech_2_desc:0 "Reinforced ramming devices, made out of composite alloy, will considerably increase their resistance to damage, as well as the damage they inflict themselves on hard target. Designed for below-waterline destruction, they can sink most vessels of their class and harm those of a class above."
  naval_subsurface_module_tech_3:0 "Torpedoes"
  naval_subsurface_module_tech_3_desc:0 "A self-propelled explosive designed to be launched below the waterline for maximum damage, those torpedoes can let us destroy enemies far larger than our vessels stealthily, as well as at a safe range."

  naval_subsurface_tech_1:0 "Spar Torpedo"
  naval_subsurface_tech_1_desc:0 "As enemy armour increases, so must our armour-piercing capabilities. As such, every ship in the fleet has been refitted with a spar torpedo, a deadly contact weapon sporting a hardened composite tip to embed itself in enemy hulls, and a remotely-triggered explosive filling to blow a massive hole under the waterline."

  naval_light_weapon_module_tech_1:0 "Scorpio"
  naval_light_weapon_module_tech_1_desc:0 "Scorpios with increased draw strength and structurally reinforced framework should let our light naval crafts engage enemy ships with a good amount of firepower."
  naval_light_weapon_module_tech_2:0 "37mm Deck Gun"
  naval_light_weapon_module_tech_2_desc:0 "Experiments with shells encasing a simple frag warhead as well as single piece ammunition, firing from a short-barrelled cannon on a swivel, results in a fast-firing naval gun suitable for screening engagements."
  naval_light_weapon_module_tech_3:0 "37mm Twin Mount Gun"
  naval_light_weapon_module_tech_3_desc:0 "A powered mount, gunner seat, longer barrel, miniaturized mechanical rangefinders and clip feeding system all combine together to allow our light assets to punch above their weight."
  naval_light_weapon_module_tech_4:0 "Super Heavy RCW"
  naval_light_weapon_module_tech_4_desc:0 "RCWs are to the laser rifle what a rotary autocannon is to a pistol. Further increased rate of fire and power supply drawn directly from the engines will let us devastate enemy screening vessels."

  naval_light_weapon_tech_1:0 "Alloy Casing"
  naval_light_weapon_tech_1_desc:0 "More resistant alloy for our shells let a thinner case wall withstand the same or higher firing pressure. Such an upgrade frees up internal space in each round for additional explosive payload and propellant, increasing projectile velocity, precision and damage."
  naval_light_weapon_tech_2:0 "Recoil-Operated Shell Extractors"
  naval_light_weapon_tech_2_desc:0 "Combining a semi-automatic locking breech block with a recoil-operated extractor considerably increases the rate of fire of our light naval guns. The breech automatically locks and is ready for firing as soon as the shell is fed, and it unlocks during the recoil motion to let the spent casing simply fall out of the barrel."
  naval_light_weapon_tech_3:0 "Chain Gun Mechanism"
  naval_light_weapon_tech_3_desc:0 "Replacing our recoil-operated mechanism with an external reloading device driven by chains and an electrical motor allows continuous firing, as the gun does not rely on sometime misfired shells to cycle, as well as controllable rate of fire. The clip feeding is also changed for a continuous belt system, completely nullifying reload time."

  naval_medium_weapon_module_tech_1:0 "Ballistae"
  naval_medium_weapon_module_tech_1_desc:0 "Ballistae provided with better pulley systems and an aiming device will let us equip our medium crafts with reasonable damage potential."

  naval_medium_weapon_module_tech_3:0 "57mm Revolver Cannon"
  naval_medium_weapon_module_tech_3_desc:0 "Designed to balance firepower and weight, the revolving firing chamber, splinter shield and direct ammunition feed pushes the limit of what we can equip our medium hulls with."
  naval_medium_weapon_module_tech_4:0 "Plasma Discharger"
  naval_medium_weapon_module_tech_4_desc:0 "Plasma reactions self-contained in a supercharged shell with a proximity fuze allows the projectile to form right in front of the enemy ship for maximum damage. Our medium ships can now even damage superheavy crafts!"

  naval_medium_weapon_tech_1:0 "Spring Buffer Mechanism"
  naval_medium_weapon_tech_1_desc:0 "The addition of a recoil tube above the barrel, using a compact coil, let the energy from firing be transferred away from the horizontal axis. This let our crew begin the reloading procedure faster, and keep our guns on target."
  naval_medium_weapon_tech_2:0 "Blowback Feeding System"
  naval_medium_weapon_tech_2_desc:0 "Replacing the old semi-automatic breech by a top-loading feeding system, and installing a new shell extraction mechanism using centre-line recoil, allows us to use three round clips for firing procedures. Doing so increases our overall rate of fire, and let us use our medium artillery guns in an almost burst-fire fashion against enemy crafts."
  naval_medium_weapon_tech_3:0 "Plasma Warhead"
  naval_medium_weapon_tech_3_desc:0 "Switching the HE filling with a plasma reaction, inspired from energy grenade designs, let our shells benefit from increased performances. In case of penetration, the now unstable filling reacts violently with the outer casing, exploding in a shower of superheated alloy. Against armour, the explosion is concentrated, blowing a hole right through it."

  naval_heavy_weapon_module_tech_1:0 "Catapult"
  naval_heavy_weapon_module_tech_1_desc:0 "One would think that a catapult would be hard to aim with. One would be wrong. Firing what amounts to aerodynamic dynamite barrels with a fuze and a fragmenting casing gives our crew a bit of leeway in that regard. A direct hit's effect is always a sight to behold."
  naval_heavy_weapon_module_tech_2:0 "75mm Deck Cannon"
  naval_heavy_weapon_module_tech_2_desc:0 "Designing bigger weaponry is generally easier for our engineers, manufacturing it is another story. A manually locking breech and two-piece ammunition as well as a reinforced firing chamber results in a cheap but effective heavy cannon."
  naval_heavy_weapon_module_tech_3:0 "75mm Revolver Cannon"
  naval_heavy_weapon_module_tech_3_desc:0 "Semi-fixed ammunition along with supercharged propellant and a revolving design will let our crew punch holes through the thickest armour at a high rate of fire."
  naval_heavy_weapon_module_tech_4:0 "Microwave Lance"
  naval_heavy_weapon_module_tech_4_desc:0 "Nuclear energy from the biggest engines in the fleet all dedicated to firing the largest directed microwave weapon known to the wasteland is sure to make an effect on the enemy's heaviest naval assets."

  naval_heavy_weapon_tech_1:0 "Depth Fuze"
  naval_heavy_weapon_tech_1_desc:0 "To increase damage, and prevent over-penetration, our shells are now equipped with a special depth fuze mechanism. Such a device uses a simple timing system, put in action by the impact of the round on the enemy hull. A good timing allows the shell to explode right in the middle of a vessel, provoking catastrophic damage."
  naval_heavy_weapon_tech_2:0 "Shrapnel Shell"
  naval_heavy_weapon_tech_2_desc:0 "Using a thin steel casing containing hundreds upon hundreds of ball bearing, we can transform our heavy weapons into naval shotguns, sweeping the sea with deadly projectiles. Against light targets, it provokes huge damage, with hundreds of hull breaches from one side of the hull to the other. Against heavy assets, it kills any personnel on deck, destroys external equipment and damages most mounted weaponry."
  naval_heavy_weapon_tech_3:0 "Superheated Projectile"
  naval_heavy_weapon_tech_3_desc:0 "With a chrome barrel lining and a microfusion energy device, our shells can be superheated to the edge of their melting point, imparting considerable thermal energy onto them. On impact, such ammunition will explode and fragment, using the enemy hull as additional spall to shred the interior with, which can easily travel through bulkhead and walls alike."

  naval_super_heavy_weapon_module_tech_1:0 "Trebuchet"
  naval_super_heavy_weapon_module_tech_1_desc:0 "Launching a 90 kg dynamite-filled projectile at a distance of up to 300 m hardly leaves a need for better firepower. Still, we shouldn't stop here, and our engineers wouldn't let us do that anyway."
  naval_super_heavy_weapon_module_tech_2:0 "90mm Deck Cannon"
  naval_super_heavy_weapon_module_tech_2_desc:0 "Slow to swivel and hard to load, don't expect it to take out light targets easily. Though, the crew displays an almost indecent excitation when ordered to fire this huge beast of a gun."
  naval_super_heavy_weapon_module_tech_3:0 "90mm Twin Cannon"
  naval_super_heavy_weapon_module_tech_3_desc:0 "No expense was spared to arm our heaviest crafts, and it shows. Twin cannon design, supercharged semi-fixed ammunition, powered shell rammer and a thick splinter shield lets us destroy anything short of a pre-war dreadnought."
  naval_super_heavy_weapon_module_tech_4:0 "Railgun"
  naval_super_heavy_weapon_module_tech_4_desc:0 "It might shut down the entire ship when it fires, but this weapon is the pinnacle of what we could ever field. Tungsten-steel alloy projectiles accelerated to unimaginable speeds will take out anything, including a pre-war dreadnought."

  naval_super_heavy_weapon_tech_1:0 "Double-Action Shell Design"
  naval_super_heavy_weapon_tech_1_desc:0 "Designing our shells around a hard core, and a secondary, soft outer projectiles, let them be effective both at piercing heavy armour and wrecking lighter vessels. When striking light armour, the outer shell provokes huge hull breaches, flattening on impact and using sheer kinetic energy. On heavy armour, it peels away, letting the core penetrate it for devastating damage."
  naval_super_heavy_weapon_tech_2:0 "Improved Screw Mechanism"
  naval_super_heavy_weapon_tech_2_desc:0 "Smoothing the action of our screw breechblock and providing our crew with powered shell rammers will both make their job easier, and increase the number of projectiles we can put downrange. The electrical shell rammer feeds ammunition directly from a ready rack, reloaded via connection to the internal magazine of the ship."
  naval_super_heavy_weapon_tech_3:0 "Experimental Velocity Booster"
  naval_super_heavy_weapon_tech_3_desc:0 "Using advanced chemical propellant in each shell allows the same velocity in a much more compact design. This reduces the weight of our projectiles, and eases reloading procedures. Instead of firing more compact ammunition, the propellant casings can also be stacked to fire a hypervelocity artillery shell, blowing open even superheavy armour."
