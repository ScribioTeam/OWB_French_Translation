  eur_desolation:0 "Desolation"
  eur_desolation_desc:0 "Eureka faced the misfortune of a barely avoiding a direct hit during the Great War. The ocean took the full force of the strike instead, mutating the natural food source of the area."
  eur_rise_of_the_portmasters:0 "Pirates, Drunks, and Whores"
  eur_rise_of_the_portmasters_desc:0 "Eureka's relative isolation meant its main natural resource, fertile farmland and fisheries, were of little use at first. But like so many other towns in history, it found that you can export mercenaries."
  eur_expedition_abroad:0 "The Granite Company"
  eur_expedition_abroad_desc:0 "To the town of old Eureka rode a stranger one fine day, \nHardly spoke to folks around him, \ndidn't have too much to say, \nNo one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip, \nFor the stranger there among them had a plasma on his hip, \nA Plasma on his hip."
  eur_the_hunt_twins:0 "Redding's Investment"
  eur_the_hunt_twins_desc:0 "Redding's barons are a lucrative source of capital and investment, and we've received offers from some folks there. And, ah, a super mutant."
  eur_olivia_focus:0 "Olivia's Pragmatism"
  eur_olivia_focus_desc:0 "Olivia's proposal makes the most sense. Fresh water has been a constant source of concern since the Great War, and rectifying that fear would go a long way to help our people."
  eur_cordell_focus:0 "Cordell's Dream"
  eur_cordell_focus_desc:0 "Ever the visionary, Cordell's plans won the day. He'll serve us well going forward as we begin to search for gold. Even if we don't find gold itself, our efforts will be sure to produce rewards."
  eur_contact_the_shi:0 "Contact the Shi"
  eur_contact_the_shi_desc:0 "The Navarro Territories are an important source of raw materials for the Shi due to their close relationship with the NCR. We may not be able to match that same level of relations with this mysterious faction, but we would certainly benefit from approaching them."
  eur_seize_our_destiny:0 "Seize Our Destiny"
  eur_seize_our_destiny_desc:0 "[EUR.GetLeader] has never truly welcomed us or had our vision. Even if he's fine for a mutant, the future belongs to those as who stand like a rock before the storm."
  eur_study_air_designs:0 "Study Air Designs"
  eur_study_air_designs_desc:0 "Our scavenging has turned up a number of blueprints and texts relating to the functions of airplanes, miraculous contraptions capable of remaining in flight using engines strapped to their wings. This sounds impossible to many, but this technology could have military applications, if used properly."
  eur_scavenge_airplanes:0 "Scavenge Airplanes"
  eur_scavenge_airplanes_desc:0 "Now that we understand airplanes we can begin to focus our scavenging teams on recovering pieces of them. This will be a slow and expensive process, especially considering the complexity of these craft."
  eur_clear_airports:0 "Clear Abandoned Airports"
  eur_clear_airports_desc:0 "Most of the nearby airports date from before the Great War and have become infested with all types of vermin or littered with serious debris. Clearing and renovating these spaces will allow our scavenged planes to be launched from them."
  eur_pilot_training_procedures:0 "Pilot Training Procedures"
  eur_pilot_training_procedures_desc:0 "Besides the need for the equipment itself, we are in desperate need to train pilots how to use it. Sadly, few in Eureka had any knowledge of planes a few months ago, making finding suitable instructors difficult. I suppose they'll have to improvise."
  eur_airborne_volunteers:0 "Airborne Volunteers"
  eur_airborne_volunteers_desc:0 "Now that we have a rudimentary system of air power established we can begin to lease our planes to our clients along with our ground army."
  eur_improve_plane_functionality:0 "Improve Plane Functionality"
  eur_improve_plane_functionality_desc:0 "Our scavenged planes tend to vary wildly in quality. Assuring some basic standard between them will allow our pilots to switch between planes easier, therefore decreasing the time it takes to train new ones or run combat operations."
  eur_construct_additional_runways:0 "Construct Additional Runways"
  eur_construct_additional_runways_desc:0 "The runways that we were able to restore from before the Great War are quickly becoming short on space. Building more should alleviate this issue, and their simple nature should make it easier. It's literally just flat land, how hard is that?"
  eur_ensure_trained_pilots:0 "Ensure Trained Pilots"
  eur_ensure_trained_pilots_desc:0 "Our mercenaries may have a fearsome reputation abroad, but our pilots certainly do not. Notorious for their mistakes and accidents, many believe they have a higher friendly fire count than enemy kill count. This is obviously unacceptable."
  eur_take_pilot_input:0 "Take Pilot Input"
  eur_take_pilot_input_desc:0 "Our pilots may have a poor reputation, but they understand the inner workings of a plane better than almost anyone. Having our designers seriously consider their input could lead to future breakthroughs in this area."

  eur_identifying_threats:0 "Identifying Threats"
  eur_identifying_threats_desc:0 "Too much time spent focusing on our own plight has blinded us to our neighbours. Thankfully, none pose an immediate threat to our freedom, but that doesn't mean we can't be cautious."
  eur_the_fearsome_bear:0 "The Fearsome Bear"
  eur_the_fearsome_bear_desc:0 "The most obvious danger to our survival is the growing NCR to the south. We aided their expansion by fighting at Navarro, and we must now be wary of their ever extending grip. The Navarro Territories may be an unstable region for now, but a stable NCR might be too dangerous to allow."
  eur_join_ncr:0 "Join the NCR"
  eur_join_ncr_desc:0 "Perhaps the best way to deal with the [NCR.GetName] is to join it, granting us a powerful ally against future aggression. We will be giving up some of our freedom, but some is better than all, as this deal will allow us to continue our way of life."
  eur_benefit_from_ncr_oversight:0 "Benefit From NCR Oversight"
  eur_benefit_from_ncr_oversight_desc:0 "As young members of the New California Republic we stand to gain massively from our overlord's investment. Encouraging these ventures could rapidly develop us, changing Eureka for the better."
  eur_against_goliath:0 "Against Goliath"
  eur_against_goliath_desc:0 "In times of great danger we have no choice but to stand up. We fought bravely against the mirelurks that terrorized us years ago, and must do so again. Our enemy poses an unconquerable danger to our people, but our Portmasters will rise to meet it."
  eur_contact_the_legion:0 "Contact the Legion"
  eur_contact_the_legion_desc:0 "Meeting with the Legion would normally be nigh impossible for a nation in our location. Luckily, the years we've spent creating contacts across the west coast will allow for us to set up a meeting. We don't love the Legion - their slaving ways are offensive and disgusting - but against the NCR we'll need every advantage we can get."
  eur_destroy_the_ncr:0 "Destroy the NCR"
  eur_destroy_the_ncr_desc:0 "The bear is distracted. We can attack now, striking quickly towards Navarro and their industrial heartland. This will be a costly war, but perhaps the only way to prevent their eventual expansion into Eureka."
  eur_the_growing_tribe:0 "The Growing Tribe"
  eur_the_growing_tribe_desc:0 "We have little experience with Arroyo's "Chosen One". We have, however, noticed their expanding borders, making our leaders wary of an eventual showdown with them. If that does come to pass, we will need to be prepared."
  eur_pursuing_partnership:0 "Pursuing Partnership"
  eur_pursuing_partnership_desc:0 "We have no reason to fear Arroyo. They may seem like foreign conquerors, but their words show that they care deeply, but for their people and for others. We will try and negotiate a settlement with them, for better or for worse."
  eur_arr_readying_for_war:0 "Readying for War"
  eur_arr_readying_for_war_desc:0 "It's foolish to see Arroyo as anything other than a would-be oppressor. We must prepare to strike, and do so quickly when given the opportunity. These preparations will be long, but also extremely effective."
  eur_provoke_unrest_in_packers:0 "Provoke Unrest in the Packers"
  eur_provoke_unrest_in_packers_desc:0 "The Arroyan occupation of the Packers is a constant headache for them. Our close proximity to the area means that we can expand that migraine through careful smuggling of guns and ammunition through the border."
  eur_invade_umbra:0 "Invade Umbra"
  eur_invade_umbra_desc:0 "We must strike now while Arroyo is weak and distracted. Waiting any longer will only give Arroyo a chance to grow stronger, eventually overwhelming us. Glory to Eureka! Down with Arroyan tyrants!"
  eur_begin_army_reforms:0 "Begin Army Reforms"
  eur_begin_army_reforms_desc:0 "The conflicts against our immediate neighbours require a different kind of army than the one we've built. Our mercenary corps is logistically strong but used to fighting undermanned and outgunned. That fact may not change in these coming conflicts, but we must build a cohesive fighting force that can bring all of its might to bear in a single battle."
  eur_finish_army_reforms:0 "Finish Army Reforms"
  eur_finish_army_reforms_desc:0 "The state of our current reforms has left us in a perilous position. We must continue these reforms in order to finalize our preparations."
  eur_finalize_a_standing_army:0 "Finalize a Standing Army"
  eur_finalize_a_standing_army_desc:0 "Even with our reforms complete, many of our men feel somewhat stranded. Not yet used to their new role and proximity to home, formally abolishing our mercenary division will allow us to dedicate the resources needed to overcome this issue."
  eur_begin_local_development:0 "Fix Up Carson Mansion"
  eur_begin_local_development_desc:0 "Since we can no longer rely on scavenging to build up our army, we must promote local development. The first step is to refurbish the old Carson Mansion, a palatial Victorian home, into the headquarters for our little town."
  eur_begin_weapons_production:0 "Gun Runner Deals"
  eur_begin_weapons_production_desc:0 "A direct source of weapons is now necessary for our forces. Perhaps we can persuade the Gun Runners to set up shop here?"
  eur_begin_local_development2:0 "Fix Up the Old Town"
  eur_begin_local_development2_desc:0 "Eureka once had a charming down-town which was a center of commerce and industry. With some proper renovations, it could have it again."
  eur_begin_weapons_production2:0 "Local Manufacturing"
  eur_begin_weapons_production2_desc:0 "Rather than relying on the Gun Runners, perhaps we should expand local manufacturing. This will not be without cost, however, and discourage any further economic development."
  eur_begin_local_development3:0 "A Caravan Hub"
  eur_begin_local_development3_desc:0 "Eureka can be so much more than a sleepy mercenary staging ground. With our recent developments we can encourage the caravan companies to turn Eureka into a staging ground for expeditions north, turning it into a model for our rule!"
  eur_begin_weapons_production3:0 "Enclave Manufacturing Techniques"
  eur_begin_weapons_production3_desc:0 "Navarro and the Rig were much like us, in some ways. Consider - they had to manufacture advanced equipment with little more than the resources of Navarro and the Rig. Perhaps their instructions could be applied here as well? Of course, the NCR will not be happy."
  eur_plasma_guns:0 "The Ultimate Firepower"
  eur_plasma_guns_desc:0 "There's nothing quite as emblematic of the Enclave's success as a plasma cannon. And at long last, the workshops of Navarro can turn out these weapons once again. "
  eur_the_growing_port: "The Growing Port"
  eur_the_growing_port_desc: "The port of Eureka has seen a massive increase in use over the past few years. Visitors now come and go regularly, not to mention our mercenary expeditions that are launched from here. Expanding the port's facilities is the obvious next step."
  eur_sell_excess_convoys: "Sell Excess Convoys"
  eur_sell_excess_convoys_desc: "Convoys are an important way for us to supply our mercenaries in the field. However, we occasionally find ourselves producing too many. Pawning them off to private buyers or other coastal tribes could be an easy way to raise money."
  eur_joint_force_drills: "Joint Force Drills"
  eur_joint_force_drills_desc: "Our naval forces often act independently of our land forces. This can often lead to serious problems, and sometime even disaster, as expected naval reinforcements will fail to arrive on time. Complex training drills should help alleviate this issue."
  eur_prioritize_army_training: "Prioritize Army Training"
  eur_prioritize_army_training_desc: "We must be certain that our naval officers act on behalf of our land forces, rather than at their own volition. Prioritizing army training will do that, although it may leave many of our officers feeling neglected."
  eur_ship_exporting_scheme: "Ship Exporting Scheme"
  eur_ship_exporting_scheme_desc: "Our last attempt to sell our convoys for caps turned out quite well. We can devote time to this idea, hopefully turning it into an easy way to continuous bring in some caps."
  eur_joint_force_support: "Offer Logistical Support"
  eur_joint_force_support_desc: "Our naval prowess provides a logistical benefit to our military offensives. We could train our naval and ground forces to offer this benefit to our clients as well. This would involve less direct combat than our mercenary corps, but allow us to refine our methods based on our experience in the field."

  eur_mercenary_expansion: "Mercenary Expansion"
  eur_mercenary_expansion_desc: "Simple logic dictates that the more conflicts we partake in, the more caps we stand to make. Therefore, our current range, limited to the immediate west coast, is far too limited. Establishing supply routes through rivers and seas can broaden our horizons significantly."
  eur_river_convoys: "River Convoys"
  eur_river_convoys_desc: "As of now, our supply ships are only built to dock at major ports, and would have serious trouble reaching our mercenaries through rivers. We can take time now to redesign our ships in order to better accommodate rivers, allowing us to establish a presence deep within the rivers of Oregon."
  eur_lower_snake_expansion: "Lower Snake River Expansion"
  eur_lower_snake_expansion_desc: "Our mercenaries report traders speaking of a variety of exotic tribes located upstream from our current outposts in Oregon's rivers. They talk of men who worship steam, forest men who walk with beasts, and unholy cannibals driven mad by ancient devices. This seems to be a prime business opportunity, and we would be fools to pass it up."
  eur_northern_expansion: "Northern Expedition"
  eur_northern_expansion_desc: "An even more savage land awaits our mercenaries to the north of Capitol Hill. The raiders here are well-known for their barbarity and will certainly welcome additional help on their raids. Hopefully, the lessons we learn in this frigid wasteland will prevent us from becoming their future victims."
  eur_mexican_expedition: "Bound for Mexico"
  eur_mexican_expedition_desc: "Mexico isn't far from our current southernmost position in the Baja. An expedition there will no doubt incur some difficulty, seeing as the language barrier could limit our ability to negotiate with potential employers, but the rewards could pay dividends if the region is as unstable as some predict."
  eur_from_north_to_south: "From North to South"
  eur_from_north_to_south_desc: "Our investments have begun to pay off. Our mercenaries have recently seen employment across the entire west coast, building a far stronger reputation than we could ever have expected. Glory to Eureka!"
  eur_south_of_honduras: "Beyond Honduras"
  eur_south_of_honduras_desc: "Our warriors have heard tale of the raider-led anarchy present throughout Central America. Finding stable clients may not be possible in that jungle wasteland, but conducting raids of our own could yield serious benefits."
  eur_timberline_scouts: "Timberline Scouts"
  eur_timberline_scouts_desc: "The Timberline tribals are a unique bunch. Predisposed to think about little but their forests, they've requested our aid in their ongoing conflict. They deserve our help - at least, more than many other of our employers - and we will be there for them. For a price."
  eur_battling_the_mutants: "Battling the Mutants"
  eur_battling_the_mutants_desc: "Left unchecked, the mutants of the Troll Warren might be the greatest threat to human survival in Oregon. We might benefit from studying their tactics first hand, but that risk is far too great to take. Battling against them will be enough."
  eur_people_of_the_steam: "People of the Steam"
  eur_people_of_the_steam_desc: "The religion, no, every aspect of Heaven's Gate is different from Eureka. Their devotion to their steam and their God is completely unlike the animistic tribals we're used to dealing with. While we're there we'll barter for some of their weapons - a unique style that uses steam for power."

  eur_our_role_in_oregon: "Our Role on the Coast"
  eur_our_role_in_oregon_desc: "Those who approach use with offers of employment often have striking similarities. A sour smile, impatient fidgeting, and an overwhelming holier-than-thou attitude permeates our employers. They pay us caps, and we offer them nothing but our temporary loyalty and expertise."
  eur_decrepit_power_armor: "Recovering Decrepit Power Armor"
  eur_decrepit_power_armor_desc: "Our volunteers in Washington have noticed a widespread practice of discarding old or broken pieces of power armor. We could begin to quietly scavenge that armor, potentially allowing for its use in our own armies."
  eur_power_armor_training: "Power Armor Training"
  eur_power_armor_training_desc: "With our newfound stockpile of power armor we must now turn to learning how to effectively deploy it in battle. It is slower and heavier than previous weapons, mandating more extensive training for our warriors who seek to use it."
  eur_lessons_from_old_enemies: "Lessons From Our Old Enemies"
  eur_lessons_from_old_enemies_desc: "The mirelurks were once the greatest threat to Eureka's survival, yet we can now count their representatives as among our employers. As odd as this seems to many of our warriors, including Portmaster Smith, the circumstances to the north are far different from what ours once were."
  eur_umbra_tribals: "The Umbra Tribals"
  eur_umbra_tribals_desc: "Our northern neighbours, Umbra has recently begun to modernize and adapt from tribal animalists to a semi-industrial nation. This hasn't been an easy road for them, as our current involvement in their affairs shows. Whether their instability will be a boon or bane for us can only be shown by time."
  eur_baja_bonanza: "Baja Bonanza"
  eur_baja_bonanza_desc: "The Baja peninsula might be the NCR's worst nightmare, but, to a mercenary, it's the perfect breeding ground for caps. The bandits are rolling in it, and more than willing to send some our way in exchange for our support against a far more formidable foe."
  eur_investing_our_gains: "Investing Our Gains"
  eur_investing_our_gains_desc: "The wealth we've amassed is of little use if its sole purpose is to buy more equipment. Our people have risked their lives and wealth to fund our mercenary expeditions, and we will be sure to repay them for their generosity."
  eur_fellow_fighters: "Fellow Fighters"
  eur_fellow_fighters_desc: "It seems that we've found like-minded friends in the Free Fighters, a group of wrestling obsessed masked men. They are certainly odd, but, really, who isn't? Our relationship with them is growing quickly, and they will make excellent partners in the future."
  eur_friends_in_the_sun: "Our Friends in the Sun"
  eur_friends_in_the_sun_desc: "Wow, sure is warm down here. The tropical paradise and sprawling villas betray a despotic rulership in [GDH.GetName], but also symbolize the wealth available to us here. El Generalissimo is more than willing to pay for our services, and there are certainly worse places to fight."
  eur_land_of_the_giants: "Land of the Giants"
  eur_land_of_the_giants_desc: "The might of the Aztlán Empire rivals even that of the NCR. Thankfully, the considerable distance between us means that our relations can only be amiable. The growing conflict between them and [ITZ.GetName] is the perfect opportunity for our meddling. Who knows, we might even learn a thing or two about agriculture while we're there."
  eur_raider_refugees: "Raider Refugees"
  eur_raider_refugees_desc: "Our forces in the northern wastes have begun to take pity on the starving refugees common throughout the area. Generations of raiding and anarchy have led to a miserable state of affairs, and our commanders have received an increasing amount of requests to return with refugee families. Endorsing these requests could act as a test of military organization and also lead to an increase in recruitment, as thankful refugees would flock to our army for work."
  eur_wanderers_welcome: "Wanderers Welcome"
  eur_wanderers_welcome_desc: "Our experience with refugees from the Broken Coast has opened our eyes to the potential present in pursuing a refugee program. Opening our cities may threaten to tax our resources, but the increase of able-bodied young people would more than make up for it."

  eur_fourways_crisis: "Intervening in Fourways"
  eur_fourways_crisis_desc: "Other than a vague proximity, the affairs of [FOU.GetName] seemingly have no reason to concern us. However, the recent steps of Arroyo and Redding towards bringing the small trading state under their control has certainly been concerning. We are far too weak to intervene directly in the issue, but could stand to play some role in its future."

  eur_modify_scavenging_procedures:0 "Modify Scavenging Procedures"
  eur_modify_scavenging_procedures_desc:0 "As our growing field of operations requires a wider selection of clients and areas of deployment we are forced to reconsider many of our scavenging practices. They've served us well this far but require additional reforms to maintain our armies."
  eur_guns_in_bulk:0 "Guns in Bulk"
  eur_guns_in_bulk_desc:0 "It only makes sense to begin by reforming our approach to scavenging infantry weapons, the backbone of our army. We could either prioritize scavenging a large amount in each trip or scavenging them quickly."
  eur_guns_quickly: "Guns, Quickly"
  eur_guns_quickly_desc:0 "It only makes sense to begin by reforming our approach to scavenging infantry weapons, the backbone of our army. We could either prioritize scavenging a large amount in each trip or scavenging them quickly."
  eur_take_it_all:0 "Take it All"
  eur_take_it_all_desc:0 "Much of the support equipment that our scavengers find on their hunts is considered too broken down to be used. Most of the time, they're right, but that doesn't always mean we should be discarding it immediately. Alternatively, teaching the scavengers to perform repairs in the field could decrease the time it takes to raise new support equipment."
  eur_rapid_repair:0 "Rapid Repair"
  eur_rapid_repair_desc:0 "Much of the support equipment that our scavengers find on their hunts is considered too broken down to be used. Most of the time, they're right, but that doesn't always mean we should be discarding it immediately. Alternatively, teaching the scavengers to perform repairs in the field could decrease the time it takes to raise new support equipment."
  eur_makeshift_power_armor:0 "Makeshift Power Armor"
  eur_makeshift_power_armor_desc:0 "Finding complete usable suits of power armor is nearly impossible outside of Brotherhood battlefields. Instead, piecing together broken down shells and raw materials could lead to a greater returning on our scavenging runs."
  eur_reuse_vertibird_engines:0 "Reuse Vertibird Engines"
  eur_reuse_vertibird_engines_desc:0 "Materials for fighter planes are few and far between, but the Navarro military base to our south is the perfect scavenging ground for old vertibird materials. We'll need to be discreet, seeing as it's deep with NCR territory, but these expeditions should quickly increase the planes available to us."
  eur_bypassed_wires:0 "Bypassed Wires"
  eur_bypassed_wires_desc:0 "Few know how our scavengers manage to repair centuries old motor vehicles. Sometimes, it's questionable whether they know themselves. Either way, we can instruct them to use clever tricks to produce vehicles quicker or create backup systems to produce more."
  eur_spare_tires:0 "Spare Tires"
  eur_spare_tires_desc:0 "Few know how our scavengers manage to repair centuries old motor vehicles. Sometimes, it's questionable whether they know themselves. Either way, we can instruct them to use clever tricks to produce vehicles quicker or create backup systems to produce more."
  eur_scavenger_to_general:0 "Scavenger to General"
  eur_scavenger_to_general_desc:0 "Every now and then, a particular scavenger shows great skill or courage in the face of danger. One of them in particular, an enigmatic figure who refers to himself only as scavenger 51, has shown impressive leadership capabilities. A promotion might be in order."
  eur_begin_expansionism:0 "Begin Expansionism"
  eur_begin_expansionism_desc:0 "Since our army no longer travels abroad to raise caps, we must make sure that it has a use at home. Our neighbours need protection, but are sadly not always willing to accept our oversight peacefully."
  eur_little_slice_paradise:0 "A Little Slice of Paradise"
  eur_little_slice_paradise_desc:0 "While Southern California is a hot, arid landscape, northern California is a a green and pleasant land. They once called people as American as apple pie, and Eureka's one of the few places to still grow them in the region. Perhaps we can encourage immigration to this frontier?"
  eur_guns_germs_or_steel:0 "Guns, Germs, or Steel"
  eur_guns_germs_or_steel_desc:0 "Oddly, being home to successful bands of mercenaries provides both protection and a ready market for a range of industries. We've had quite a few people express some interest in opening up shop in Eureka. But who do we favor?"
  eur_francis_won:0 "Supermutant Industry"
  eur_francis_won_desc:0 "What big arms they have! The better to lift heavy machinery and move it from place to place. Whatever our criticisms, it's clear they've been able to do far more than 'smoothskins' would alone."
  eur_salvage_operations:0 "Salvage Operations"
  eur_salvage_operations_desc:0 "You know, there are some old ships that seemed to wash up on shore outside Eureka. Perhaps we could take them apart for metal? I bet we can find a use for it."
  eur_new_management: "Under New Management"
  eur_new_management_desc:0 "Together the Regulators, Portmasters, illiterate savage tribals and Granite Company drove the NCR out of Navarro. A true inspiration for all advocates of tolerance. But now we need to figure out how to handle hundreds of miles of territory  . . . "
  eur_new_generation: "A New Generation"
  eur_new_generation_desc:0 "What makes a man turn mercenary? Lust for gold? Power? Loyalty to a forgotten cause? Or perhaps he was with a heart of neutrality. With proper funding, we could those in the Wasteland who are willing to fight for any, or all, of these causes."
  eur_new_generation_tt:0 "\n§gOrion Moreno returns to the fold.\n§!"
  eur_suspicion_increase_tt:0 "\n§PThis will increase the NCR's suspicion.§!"
  eur_power_armor_specialization:0 "A Proper Uniform"
  eur_power_armor_specialization_desc:0 "To think that the X01 was once feared throughout California, and now we are reduced to whatever salvage we can find! Still, with proper funding we can hire salvagers to augment our reserves. It can't hurt, right?"
  eur_power_armor_specialization_tt:0 "\n§PUnlocks a decision to repair power armour at the risk of alerting the Bear. But who cares what they think?"
  eur_refugees_rig:0 "Settlers or 'Settlers'?"
  eur_refugees_rig_desc:0 "Navarro is still a rich, untamed frontier. But how do we get settlers to come here given that we just had a civil war and drove out the NCR?"
  eur_plasma_grenades:0 "Van Graff Shipments"
  eur_plasma_grenades_desc:0 "If we want to deploy a proper military force with energy weapons, we will need to contact an outside supplier. Fortunately, the Van Graffs are ready, willing, and able to meet our demands. As long as our enemies don't think of trading with a ::checks notes:: arms dealer, we will be unmatched in the Wasteland."
  eur_plasma_grenades_tt:0 "\n§PUnlocks a decision to buy weapons from the Van Graffs at the risk of alerting the Bear. So sad."
  eur_scientists_to_navarro:0 "Learning From the Past"
  eur_scientists_to_navarro_desc:0 "Granite Company once worked for a force with fusion plants and the best quantum mud pie west of the Mississippi. The Regulators once held sway in the richest town in New California. But now Eureka must get by on scavenging and limited equipment like everyone else. Surely there is someone who will work for us?"
  eur_power_armor_specialization1:0 "An Army With a Nation"
  eur_power_armor_specialization1_desc:0 "You think Eureka is but a band of pirates, scalwawags, drunks and whores? Perhaps. But can be so much more. The finest military force for the west coast, come together to show the rest of the Wasteland what we can do.  History called us villains - the future will call us heroes."
  eur_power_armor_specialization1_tt:0 "\n§PObviously, the NCR will become more suspicious from the massed power armor units.§!"
  eur_brahmin_ranches:0 "Brahmin Ranches"
  eur_brahmin_ranches_desc:0 "One way to get on the NCR's good side would be to allow the brahmin barons to lease land in Redding in Redding. This would be somewhat controversial with the tribals in the area, but we will look out for their interests in a way Shady Sands did not. And [NCR.GetLeader] is smart enough to recognize that half a loaf is better than none."
  eur_workshops_of_navarro:0 "Navarro's Workshops"
  eur_workshops_of_navarro_desc:0 "The NCR desecrated the armouries and workshops of Navarro, but there's no reason we can't get them up and running again. Is there?"
  eur_packing_defenses:0 "The Mutant Threat"
  eur_packing_defenses_desc:0 "The north there are mutants, cannibals, an obviously satanic Brotherhood, and Canadarians. To properly secure our perimeter, we must seize control of §Y[PAC.GetNameWithFlag]§! and protect California. Plus, think of all the money a new trade route could bring."
  eureka_vertibirds:0 "The Sky's the Limit"
  eureka_vertibirds_desc:0 "It's been decades since the Enclave took to the sky. But we can still find those who loved to fly, and with control of Navarro we can, once again, build vertibirds. Truthfully? There is no greater joy than being in a cockpit."

  eur_infrastructure_development:0 "Taxing Trade"
  eur_infrastructure_development_desc:0 "The NCR never truly tamed Navarro, but we could. A few roads to connect settlements will increase trade - and with more trade comes more to 'tax'."

  eur_enclave_technicians_desc:0 "200 years of keeping a technological civilization with only an Oil Rig, a series of military bases, and a glorious beacon of tomorrow in the American midwest wasn't easy. Good thing we've got some experience, then."
  eur_attack_ncr:0 "The Enclave Strikes Back"
  eur_attack_ncr_desc:0 "Granite Company - always outnumbered, never outgunned. One swift kick will send New California's corrupt regime down, and we will be greeted as liberators."
  eu_ncr_puppet:0 "The Last Hope of America"
  eu_ncr_puppet_desc:0 "We have a choice to make. We could attack the NCR; and we might even win, given their overextension. But the death toll will be catastrophic. What if we try something else? \n\nThe NCR keeps many of America's traditions alive. Baseball. Consumerism.  And elections."
  eu_ncr_puppet_tt:0 "You will become a puppet of the NCR, but have a chance to run for president!"
  eur_awsome_power_armor:0 "Back in Black"
  eur_awsome_power_armor_desc:0 "Many a soldier joined Granite Company hoping to get a suit of our power armour.  These fools fail to understand just how difficult it is to make X-01 suits. Granite Company simply did not have the industrial capacity to do that; we were a mercenary group, not a state. Control of Arroyo's resources, however, opens up wonderful opportunities."
  eur_army_conscription:0 "Recruitment Drives"
  eur_army_conscription_desc:0 "Many of Granite Company's recent members were, to be frank, more than fools, dreamers, and mercenaries out for a buck. But in Navarro we see the stirrings of greatness. A nation waiting "
  eur_god_bless_enclave:0 "God Bless the Enclave"
  eur_god_bless_enclave_desc:0 "Some small part of Granite's brain wondered if there was another path. One where he stepped forward into greatness. Should he have gone east, to Macarthur? Or even to Chicago? Would Granite company have made a difference there? But might have beens were a silly game. Their victory out west was clear.  The Enclave is back, California!"
  eu_army_conscription:0 "Coming Home"
  eu_army_conscription_desc:0 "San Francisco is a town of complicated feelings for many of us.  The Star Father's children were expelled by the intolerant Shi, while Granite Company believes the terrorist attack on the rig set sail from the ancient port. Perhaps it is time to pay our old friends a visit."
  eur_whacha_gonna_do:0 "Too Big to Fail"
  eur_whacha_gonna_do_desc:0 "Eureka's success has turned our happy little group into an army with a state, an unsteady solution. To do anything else, we're going to need a leader. But who?"
  eur_whacha_gonna_do_tt:0 "The Fate of Eureka will be decided by whichever group is strongest."
  eur_regulator_rail_guns:0 "Regulator Rail Guns"

  eur_enclave_strikes_back:0 "Remember the Rig"
  eur_enclave_strikes_back_desc:0 "The NCR slaughtered our brothers and sisters at Navarro 30 years ago. But we survived. The Enclave is back, America! And not just on your radio. Soon, in your cities too."
  eur_portmaters_goals:0 "Ports Without End"
  eur_portmaters_goals_desc:0 "If we want to access every market, we'll need new staging grounds. Port Royale and the Viceroyalty will do."

  ncr_regulator_friends_desc:0 "The Republic is many things, but a fairweather friend? Well, a little. Still, now they will honour our once and for all. Why, we'll even take out the Brotherhood for them."
