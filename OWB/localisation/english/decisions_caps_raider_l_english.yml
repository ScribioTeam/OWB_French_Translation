  ###RESPONSE FAIL
   caps_raider_events.22.t:0 "Raid Repelled"
   caps_raider_events.22.d:0 "We have repelled multiple raiding parties from §R[FROM.FROM.GetName]§! It seems like they wanted to slip by unnoticed between border patrols, thankfully our boys sure know how to shoot, and sent them back to their pitiful land with many busted kneecaps."
   caps_raider_events.22.a:0 "It may be worth suring up defenses in §Y[FROM.GetName]§!"
  ###Minor Raid Sucess
   caps_raider_events.1.t:0 "Country Side Raid Successful"
   caps_raider_events.1.d:0 "Y'know, this ended up being way easier than i thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, i'm not complaining, but like... a fat dude and a thin tall guy as border guards?

    caps_raider_events.5.a:0 "Big guns, big money"


    caps_raider_events.6.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Rejected."

   caps_raider_events.31.d:0 "We raided §R[FROM.FROM.FROM.GetName]§!, those idiots never saw it coming, and we got to get away with mountains of cap to spend! If all jobs were that easy i'd already be retired, if i didn't enjoy burning stuff down so much."
   caps_raider_events.31.a:0 "Let's keep going like that, and we'll buy out the wasteland!"

We'll just need to give Larry a peg leg and replace the fifty-two other boys we lost in the raid."
  caps_raider_events.3.a:0 "Hopefully we can rally the gang before they think they would be better on their own."
  caps_raider_events.3.b:0 "Let's just blame Larry, he keeps dropping the explosives anyway."
  ### RAID STALEMATE

  caps_raider_events.2.d:0 "Our troops couldn't break through their defences, and so our officers saw fit to order a retreat to properly reorganize. Still, this is a stalemate, and a shameful one at that."
  caps_raider_events.2.a:0 "At least our troops came back."

   caps_raider_events.52.a:0 "They think they can tell us what to do? Get the explosives, boys!"
