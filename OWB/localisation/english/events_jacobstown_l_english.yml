  nf_jacobstown.1.d:0 "Disappointed with a lack of faith from his fellow super mutants - particularly the nightkin - Marcus has finally decided that the dream of Jacobstown is no longer sustainable. Suddenly leaving with a small group of dedicated friends, he was last seen striding north through the snow-covered forests surrounding the town.\n\n\n\nQuick to take advantage of the power vacuum, nightkin raids have already begun probing nearby settlements and trading caravans. Underneath Keene's paranoid leadership, the future of the Northern Mojave looks much more violent than before."
