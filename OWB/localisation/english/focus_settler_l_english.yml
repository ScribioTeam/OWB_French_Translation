It will not be long until they are made the rulers of our country, and there is little wrong with that."

  settler_focus_monopoly:0 "Monopoly"
  settler_focus_monopoly_desc:0 "Surprisingly, a few business magnate actually fled our state after seeing the display of militarism and violence in the aftermath of revengist sentiments.
