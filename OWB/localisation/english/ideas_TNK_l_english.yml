 tnk_old_world_blues_desc:0 "There is an expression in the Wasteland:\n"Old World Blues."\n\nIt refers to those so obsessed with the past they can't see the present, much less the future, for what it is.\nThey stare into the what-was, eyes like pilot lights, guttering and spent, as the realities of their world continue on around them.\nScience is a long, steady progression into the future. What may seem a sudden event often isn't felt for years, even centuries, to come.\n\nIn the times following the First Battle of the Hoover Dam, however, Old World Blues took on a new meaning.\nWhere once it was viewed as a form of sadness, nostalgia, it became an expression describing the potential for the future.\nIt can be easy to see Science as evil, technology unchecked as the source of all ills, all misfortunes.\nWith the Think Tank united under a common cause for the first time in over two hundred years science would become a beacon for the future. There was Old World Blues, and New World Hope. And hope ruled the day at Big MT. "
