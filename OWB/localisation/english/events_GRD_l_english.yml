  nf_grd.1.t:0 "Speak No Evil, Hear No Evil"
  nf_grd.1.d:0 "When Maxson’s radio calls were sent out across the Wasteland after the Great War, not all of the army detachments agreed with Maxson’s orders and archaic doctrines. One such few detachments were the Guardians, who had sought to develop their own accords. \n\nWhile they shared the same concern over technology—dangerous in the wrong hands, rightful in theirs—they also believed that words held more power.  Everyone has a voice, everyone has ideals, but not all are fair or just, and so easily can destruction form from wayward commands, especially when imposed upon the weak minded. \n\nThus, the Guardians cut off communications with Lost HIlls, traders, and even the rest of the wasteland in fear of corruption tainting their wills. Led by the steadfast Cardinal Scott, he plans on guiding the Guardians through their missions."
  nf_grd.1.a:0 "With him, the nonsense of the world will drown."
  nf_grd.1.b:0 "But an ear to the ground never hurts in gauging decisions."

  nf_grd.2.t:0 "Gold In Quagmires"
  nf_grd.2.d:0 "The Guardians were no exception to learning about the rumoured Treasure of the Valley. Anything from the outside was trouble as is, and Cardinal had begun to suspect that this “treasure” was just another ruse—another fairytale that lured in the weak.  But his ambition for progress was an everburning hunger. Over the years their numbers had dwindled. The newer flock of Guardians yearned for the outside; many having died to see it. \n\nBetween his unwillingness to budge from sacred protocol and his fear of growing unruliness, Cardinal came to a compromise.  Expeditions deeper into the valley for this ‘treasure’ would be sanctioned.  With that, Cardinal hoped for some peace of mind, if not the truth of the treasure itself."
  nf_grd.2.a:0 "The expeditions proved fruitful."
  nf_grd.2.b:0 "But alas, nothing was found.  Lessons were learned."

  nf_grd.3.t:0 "The Gray Static Of Yore"
  nf_grd.3.d:0 "Channel 4 had been an enigma for years. The leaders before Cardinal had denounced it, claiming it a demon’s lure, but Cardinal had learned from their mistakes and their ignorance. It was not a lure.  It was a test—a trial, abundant with technology no doubt.  For what power could orchestrate a show that ran on day-in and day-out, entailing the lives of fake people? A challenge of a mystery it would be, but Cardinal favoured his odds for the spoils."
  nf_grd.3.a:0 "Everything strange happens in the valley."
