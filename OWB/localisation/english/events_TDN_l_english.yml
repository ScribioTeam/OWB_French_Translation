########## Den starting events
  nf_den.1.t: "Den after the Great War"
  nf_den.1.d: "Before the Great War, Den was one of the many thousands of towns in America that no one else had heard of other than its own residents. There were thousands across America. They were created in golden times, when the West Coast was just populated by people from the East. Over time, their golden years passed, they were half empty, they became useless to anyone. By the time of the Resource Wars, things were getting much worse, because the fear of China became similar to the fear of Japan. Many thousands were frightened by the Chinese landing in Alaska and its possible continuation in California. Like World War II, America was once again seized with fear and no one knew what to do about it other than trying to run as far from the source of the threat as possible. So such cities turned into ghost towns, where most of the buildings looked still untouched by time, but at the same time they were already deserted for a long time.\n\nWhen the bombs fell, not every city in America was destroyed. Yes, big cities like Salt Lake City and Los Angeles were filled with radiation. But even a huge country like China could not build enough bombs to destroy every city in America, even though they did their best to do so. It was to such towns that the population rushed after the fall of nuclear bombs. At the time, Den was not yet a dirty hole, it was one of the many towns that attracted too many people. And overpopulation and lack of resources eventually reaped their grim harvest.\n\nBut what was it about him that interested everyone so much?"
  nf_den.1.a: "Pure water without radiation"
  nf_den.1.b: "Convenient trading position"

  nf_den.2.t: "Origin of the Mordino family"
  nf_den.2.d: "Mordino... Once upon a time it was they who ruled New Reno, but like everyone who came to the very top of power, they started small. NCR, after all, was once only a small village called Shady Sands, threatened by raiders and scorpions. But such ridiculous forces did not prevent them from eventually becoming one of the greatest forces in all of post-war America. And it is not known if someone will be able to stop them in the future. It was the same with the Mordino family.\n\nReno always gave a huge number of opportunities to those who were risk enough and willing to accept responsibility for possible failure. This has always been and will be so until someone powerful returns the order of the Old World to Reno or destroys it completely. A huge number of families emerged from nothing, some of them only for a few years, others for decades. The Bishops rose in ties to the NCR and casinos, making Reno the tourist capital of Nevada. The Wrights had unity and alcohol. Even Salvatore had allies in the Enclave. Likewise, the Mordinos themselves, their power had a source for a very, very long time, long before their expulsion from Reno.\n\nBut what were they doing before the drug trade?"
  nf_den.2.a: "They made a lot of money to run hotels"
  nf_den.2.b: "They were the capos of one of the families that existed before"

  nf_den.3.t: "Rise of the Mordino family"
  nf_den.3.d: "Reno is a city where everything happens according to the natural order of things. Property and influence from the weak passes to the strong, cunning and powerful. This has always been and will always be so, until humanity comes up with a way to finally destroy itself. There is simply no one here to try to hide the bitter truth for weaklings and losers, unlike NCR. Reno is the city of victorious social Darwinism, where those who can overcome their own weaknesses and stand above human vices win.\n\nEach family has appeared at the expense of some vice of human society. Gambling mania and Bishops. Alcoholism and Wrights. Even the fear of the unknown and Salvatore. They all profited from human weakness. But we do not condemn, in the end, this is how Mordinos received real power, which everyone else did not dream of. An attempt at condemnation from us would look like sheer hypocrisy. But we are honest at least in our criminal nature, due to which we received a huge fortune.\n\nBut what specific crimes did we hunt in the first place, for which we were hated and feared throughout Nevada and northern California?"
  nf_den.3.a: "Creation and improvement of jet"
  nf_den.3.b: "Support for slave trade"
  nf_den.3.c: "Cat Paw’s control"
  nf_den.3.e: "Trading chemicals"

  nf_den.4.t: "Fall of the Mordino family"
  nf_den.4.d: "Thirty years... thirty years since our family has been in a kind of exile from Reno. Thirty years ago, we were at the very top of power in New Reno and no one could destroy us alone. And paranoia between the New Reno families ensured that they would never unite against anyone else, constantly fearing betrayal by their allies. Those were glorious times.\n\nIt ended when a savage appeared in the city and rock itself followed. How much can one person do for a city of many thousands? It turned out that very, very much. Although he was by no means able to directly influence, many are sure that it was with him that the chain of events began, which led to the current situation in Reno. And this already led to the fall of the influence of our family.\n\nIn the end, we were banished and cursed, for our pride, for our blindness and resting on the laurels of victory. We roamed the Wastes, where we were threatened by need and raiders. This continued until we found a temporary shelter for ourselves - Den, this is exactly what Don Mordino himself hopes.\n\nBut how exactly did our fall begin and the consequences of which we still feel on ourselves?"
  nf_den.4.a: "Chosen One killed Myron and ravaged us"
  nf_den.4.b: "There was a cure for jet"
  nf_den.4.c: "A gang war nearly wiped out the family"


########## Chester border war

  nf_den.5.t: "Victory at Sierra"
  nf_den.5.d: "Sierra Army Base is a former US military army base in Nevada that few people have heard of. We can say - just a lost place that absolutely no one needs. It was so until Don Mordino decided to restore the power of his own criminal clan. For this very purpose, he sent his own forces and his allies to capture this city, for he was on the shortest path between Den and Reno.\n\nIt all ended in victory for Mordino. The scattered thugs of the New Reno families simply could not do anything and fled. This city is not so important for us as victory is important. In the end, this means that we can win this war, which means that our allies will remain on our side."

  nf_den.11.d: "What about the Fourways? Nothing, it's just an unknown tribe north of Redding. Even the followers of the Apocalypse cannot say more about them.

########## Slice of life events

  nf_den.24.t:0 "Long-awaited victory"
  nf_den.24.d:0 "Jesus Mordino has always been in the shadow of his father. He was at one time the most influential person in Reno, but because of this savage, their family lost not only their influence, but also their place in one of the greatest cities in the pre-war United States. Everyone looked at him with contempt, as if he was guilty of the family's failure to keep their attention. But now no one will doubt his abilities. He has reclaimed Reno, a city that should be his by right!\n\nThe motorcade drove into Reno along the main road, passing through the burned-out buildings that belonged to the Wright and Bishops. On the sides crowded the usual urban rabble, which came to gaze at the most influential man of this city, before he became boring and hated. Jesus did not order to drive the population, everyone came here of their own free will. But at the same time, no one will say that they still have their own will. So far, he is in complete control of them, grabbing all their attention. Today he is the Emperor, entering his Rome for triumph.\n\nBut moments like this leave bitter pain. The feeling of the peak of your own achievements, when you realize that you cannot rise higher."
  nf_den.24.a:0 "This will not be the crown of achievements."

  nf_den.25.t:0 "Son's revenge"
  nf_den.25.d:0 "Jesus Mordino stood in his casino, discussing with his closest aides how they would send the first caravan to Arroyo. It should have been something of a goodwill gesture. The proposal to bury the ax of war from the son of his father, who lost everything due to the actions of the Chosen One. A new milestone in the history of northern California. Yes, our peoples can be extremely, extremely different, but in the end, if we are not friends, we can at least not interfere with each other.\n\nThis is what they had to convince the inhabitants of Arroyo. If they believe this, then these savages will be some of the greatest fools there is in the Wasteland. Of course, the first caravan will be nothing more than a caravan of bread, obtained by slave labor from the vicinity of Deng. Ethically disgusting, but nothing illegal. They will, of course, grimace, but they will start buying food from us. And then there will be real caravans that will bring some more drugs.\n\nRevenge is a dish that takes a long time to cook and is best served cold. And if need be, Jesus is ready to wait for years, but one day he will still be able to flood Arroyo with cheap drugs. The Chosen One tried to clean out New Reno, believing he could do something. Never! Death awaits every hero. But the Chosen One will receive before this the ruin of everything that is dear to him."
  nf_den.25.a:0 "Mr. Mordino gives you his greetings."

  nf_den.26.t:0 "The last Salvatore"
  nf_den.26.d:0 "Salvatore and Mordino have never been ardent allies. But at the same time, one could admit that they considered themselves kindred spirits, unlike the Bishops and Wrights. The Wrights were flirting too much with the people, and the Bishops were upstarts who built their influence on contracts with this whore Tandy. They were originally from Reno and followed the unofficial law of the streets of this city. A cruel law that allowed Reno to survive the aftermath of the Great War and become a force in the Wasteland. But the Mordinos are now forced to huddle in Den, while there is practically nothing left of Salvatore. Their opponents live in Reno and continue to share the legacy of their fathers.\n\nNo wonder the two of them are gathered in this building now to discuss how they will regain power in Reno. Jesus Mordino knew that he could not do without Salvatore in this matter. And his opponent knew this, as well as the fact that he had no other way to return to Reno alive. All hate them too much for their alliance with the Enclave, and Mordino are the few who are ready to turn a blind eye to this.\n\nBoth sides needed each other, but neither of them was ready to give up a single pound of precious influence on the future Reno, so there was only a long process of finding a compromise."
  nf_den.26.a:0 "This will be the longest night of his life."

  nf_den.27.t:0 "New Desperado"
  nf_den.27.d:0 "Jesus Mordino stood outside Desperado, a rebuilt casino that once belonged to his family. Yes, he was a brutal bandit, murderer and plunderer. But he could not help but admit that even just standing near this casino was extremely exciting./n/nHe knew the whole history of this casino, the whole history of this building after the Great War, since they started small. It was once a homeless shelter that has been turned into a hotel. An honest business in a completely lawless Wasteland. How ridiculous it is now to think that when the rule of law finally reigned in the Wasteland, his family became involved in an exclusively illegal business./n/nGradually the hotel turned into a casino. Over time, they decided to add drugs to the casino sales, in addition to alcohol. Then his father realized that it was more profitable to produce drugs themselves, rather than buy them. And over time, the casino has become for them rather a tribute to the memory of those who gave rise to all this, because their income was mainly from another source./n/nOf course, there were dark times as well. For example, this damn Chosen One after which the casino was abandoned, turning again into a den for drug addicts. But everything is returning to its place, and their casino is once again a sparkling city center!"
  nf_den.27.a:0 "Home, sweet home."

  nf_den.28.t:0 "Megalodon"
  nf_den.28.d:0 "The Shark Club has always been a highlight of this city, which the founder of their family loved to disgrace Mordino. And really, how did the Bishops manage to achieve the same in ten years as the Mordino forty? And then they completely expelled his family from the city, finally sending Mordino to the dustbin of history, as many believed./n/nBut as history has shown, it is he who now laughs the last, standing now on the site of the ruins of this once gorgeous casino. The smoke from the fires has already subsided, and the smell of burning has disappeared, leaving only the homeless who have climbed into the still strong frame of the building. Before the Great War, they knew how to build well./n/nAt that moment Jesus was thinking about Mr. Bishop. Despite the enmity and hatred between their families, he never had anything against him personally. He was cunning, cruel, even insidious. But in no case was he a coward and had his own boundaries, which he did not want to cross. Who knows, if their families were not enemies, maybe they would be best friends. Or not. Still, too ambitious to get along together. In any case, it's a shame that such a talent ended up like that./n/nHowever, he still could do something for him. Yes. The Bishops were good. But the era of Mordino has arrived, and now there will be a new casino, Megalodon. He could build it anywhere in the city, take any building. Fittingly the source of his family's ruin, this last stronghold of resistance would become the foundation of his new Empire, a testament to the single family that now ruled New Reno!"
  nf_den.28.a:0 "My last gift, old enemy."

  nf_den.29.t:0 "Only honest family"
  nf_den.29.d:0 "He had to do it, he had to crush the Wrights, he couldn't afford to accept their surrender and leave them alone to save the lives of the fighters on both sides. It is not even a matter of pride and his desire to be the sole ruler of the city. Because the Wrights are the most dangerous family in this city and no one can match them./n/nYes, it may sound absurd, but it really is. They have no big money, no high technology, no political connections or an army of thugs. They simply do not need all this, since they have a much more dangerous weapon than any of those that Jesus Mordino himself can acquire. They have the potential to make people fall in love with them, give them hope for a better future, and turn this to their advantage./n/nSomeone may ridicule him for such an idealistic speech. Love? Loyalty? In Reno, in the city of sin? But this is exactly so, and he would not be alive if he did not understand the power that they possessed. People can grovel in front of him. But they will follow the Wrights. While Mordino can only expect a knife in the back if, by his stupidity, he turns his back on someone./n/nBut otherwise they could have achieved a lot if they had not believed in their own lies. And now people are greeted with grief by the one who leads them on the crusade. It has always been this way, brave men die, and somewhere on the sidelines there is a puppeteer."
  nf_den.29.a:0 "Naive fools."

  nf_den.30.t:0 "Debt is paid by deed"
  nf_den.30.d:0 "Salvatore stood beside him smiling and looking at their family building. There was no strained politeness in that smile, no hidden mockery. He was just glad that he was standing in front of his home again. The fire and the subsequent oblivion could destroy a lot, but the place of the building was left unoccupied, so they just rebuilt it from scratch.\n\n Yes, it was expensive. Yes, it was hard. Hell, most don't realize, it's somewhat difficult to get good quality construction equipment and concrete in the Wasteland. Especially when the former is only produced in Vault City, and the latter is only produced in the New California Republic. But in the end, the Mordinos keep their word. Not always, of course, but only so far it is beneficial for them in the long run.\n\nYes, in the end, the heads of the criminal cartels are still people and sometimes they can afford a little sentimentality. A little and only on big holidays. But returning home and defeating old enemies, perhaps, can be considered a sufficient reason."
  nf_den.30.a:0 "I told you that we will do it!"

  ########## NCR War

  nf_den.31.t:0 "Unthinkable Claims"
  nf_den.31.d:0 "An unexpected request came to us from the Mordino family, which at the moment is the controlling power of New Reno. In connection with the war that the New California Republic is waging, they are demanding that we hand over Redding and the surrounding area to them. According to them, this is their demand for the sake of ensuring the security of their economic ties with this city.\n\nWe know perfectly well what economic ties this pack of thieves, drug dealers and raiders can have. They want to regain this city, they want to make it another of their freemen, to get a source of gold. In any other situation, our response to such an insane demand would have been quite unambiguous and simple. Of course, a punitive operation in the direction of these bandits would be a matter of prestige for us.\n\nHowever, we are now at war with Caesar's Legion. Most of our forces are diverted, with the result that we can hardly afford such an operation. So, perhaps, accepting this requirement will cost us less losses?"
  nf_den.31.a:0 "We have to agree to the demands."
  nf_den.31.b:0 "The Republic will not cede an inch of land!"

  nf_den.32.t:0 "Dark day for the NCR"
  nf_den.32.d:0 "Our standoff against New Reno's Mordino raider army isn't going too well. Rather, to some extent it can be called a complete disaster. It's not just Redding and the surrounding area that we've lost control of. For us, in addition to this, Sacramento is also lost.\n\nPerhaps, in the name of further losses, it would be better for us to end the conflict on the terms that they dictate to us, before the situation gets even worse?"
  nf_den.32.a:0 "Yes, we lose this war."
  nf_den.32.b:0 "No, we don't leave our citizens for this scum!"

  ########## Rebecca

  nf_den.33.t:0 "Our Chosen History"
  nf_den.33.d:0 "It's hard enough to downplay the role of a person like the Chosen One, given his influence throughout northern California. He was noted in almost every major community, determining their future. Somewhere he acted openly and it was his decision that determined the future of cities, for example, in Redding. Largely thanks to him, this city turned out to be part of the New California Republic.\n\nIn other cases, his intervention was much less noticeable. An example is his actions in Klamath. Yes, he certainly saved the city from the invasion of rats. But most of the townspeople didn't even realize the extent of the problem, so he was forgotten shortly after he entered the city. The wasteland knew many mysterious wanderers, and therefore stories about him quickly remained in the memory of the few who knew him personally.\n\nThe Chosen One left his mark in this city, which was then under the control of Metzger and his guild of slavers. These were dark times, even Mordino were more humane rulers in some way. However, Dan was cursed not only figuratively, but quite literally, given the presence of a restless ghost. In those restless days, the city was literally languishing from spiritual and physical suffering, and the Chosen One could not calmly pass by the suffering, solving one of the problems?"
  nf_den.33.a:0 "He gave rest to the ghost."
  nf_den.33.b:0 "He killed Metzger."

  nf_den.34.t:0 "Mordino's March"
  nf_den.34.d:0 "Unfortunately, such great people as the Chosen One are driven by a great goal, which does not allow them to stay in one place for a long time. As a result, despite the improvement in life after his actions, Den was once again in danger. This was compounded by the fact that, thanks to his actions, the Mordino family's influence in Reno declined, and they were eventually forced to flee the city only to survive the relentless gang struggle.\n\nIn the end, despite all the actions of the Chosen One, Mordino still had connections in this city, since it was largely thanks to them that he existed. They still had their own leverage on the locals, so without a strong leader inside or good protection outside, the city was doomed. Unfortunately, at that moment the city had neither the first nor the second.\n\nSo how exactly did Mordino decide to capture the city? They launched a direct attack, won over the gangs operating in the city, or they made a slow conquest, luring the city's defenders with drugs."
  nf_den.34.a:0 "Direct attack."
  nf_den.34.b:0 "Hire gangs."
  nf_den.34.c:0 "Use drugs."

  nf_den.35.t:0 "History repeats itself twice: the first time as a tragedy, the second time as a farce"
  nf_den.35.d:0 "Jesus Mordino was woken up by the creaking of the door, which echoed in his mind with terrifying pain. The only hope for him is that his fate is sealed and someone has come to kill him. After failing to attack Reno, everyone abandoned him. No one will go to war for a weakling who cannot even win a border conflict. His own subordinates locked him in this room for two weeks, preventing him from leaving. As a result, the only thing left for him was to drink too much, since there was enough alcohol in the refrigerator.\n\nDamn cowards. They couldn't even bring themselves to kill him. They were too afraid of the struggle for power, or did not believe in their own strength to lead the city. These pathetic weaklings could not decide for two weeks who would kill him and take power for themselves. He even wondered which of his subordinates it was now. Who suddenly woke up with willpower?\n\nHowever, what he saw surprised him even more. It was an old woman, Rebecca, the oldest resident of the city and the owner of a casino. Amazing. Jesus had dozens of bandits, but none of them had balls to kill his boss and end his suffering. The damn hag had more courage.\n\nCome on, end my suffering. This is a great opportunity for you to make history. Kill me, but remember that in this case, not just a person will die. The whole family of Mordino will die. The same Mordinos that everyone north of Shady Sands feared. Put an end to this comedy."

Now representatives from them have come to us, offering to unite in the face of the ambitions of the people of New Reno, who are trying to expand all influence into Western Nevada.
