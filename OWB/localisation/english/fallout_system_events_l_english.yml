  fallout_system.1.d:0 "Hey! Its Zusk here. Senior developer on Old World Blues!\n\nThis is a preliminary support release for the DLC No Step Back.\n\nThis early support was mostly the work of just me with the help of key individuals from Equestria at War as well.\nIn later updates expect bugs in this release to get ironed out, mechanics from NSB such as Trains and supply to be properly implemented and several of the new features of the DLC, such as custom map modes to be fleshed out.\n\nUntil then, expect this release of Old World Blues to be somewhat buggy. Some things might not work right, some things might look strange, some things might not work at all.\n\nPlease buy the DLC if you like OWB!"
