NAV_history_of_the_people:0 "The History of the People"
NAV_history_of_the_people_desc:0 "Some say the Navajo descend from the First Man and woman, who built a home to be sacred and beautiful in Dinétah . Others claim the Navajo immigrated to the American southwest in the 1400s. The wisest of the People know both are true."
NAV_before_the_great_war:0 "A Complicated Relationship"
NAV_before_the_great_war_desc:0 "The years before the Great War were difficult for the Navajo. Although mining and economic devleopment brought prosperity, many in America saw the Navajo Reservation as land to exploit."
NAV_caesar_legion:0 "The Fifth World"
NAV_caesar_legion_desc:0 "The Great War did not spare the Navajo, but they survived in the new world where many did not. A common culture, and being spared the worst of the bombs, let the Navajo rebuild when others fell to hunger, raiders, or their own base instincts. The Navajo Scouts repelled Arizona slavers, their goats and brahmin multiplied, and their silversmiths turned towards metalwork for their own use. Until the Legion arrived."
NAV_navajo_economy_start:0 "The Three Sisters"
NAV_navajo_economy_start_desc:0 "The People once subsisted on the three sisters: corn, beans, and squash. Today the three sisters are agriculture, mining, and trade. We must develop all three to stand strong and free."
NAV_windmills:0 "The Niltsi Wind Farm"
NAV_windmills_desc:0 "What better way to honour the god of wind than to build a new power plant? As his whispered words of wisdom to the Monster Slayer, may this plant breathe new life into our hearths and homes."
NAV_silversmiths:0 "The Silversmiths"
NAV_silversmiths_desc:0 "The Navajo silversmiths have been famous for five hundred years. We sell their wares throughout the Wastes and bring new wealth to our people."
NAV_brahmin_herds:0 "The Brahmin Herds"
NAV_brahmin_herds_desc:0 "The People have a saying; 'the herd is life.'  Sheep, brahmin, and goats feed and clothe our people. The prosperity we have earned under the Legion has let us develop our techniques even further and adapt to feed a larger market. "
NAV_uranium_mines:0 "Opening the Uranium Mines?"
NAV_uranium_mines_desc:0 "The Uranium mines of the Navajo served America before the Great War. We will never expose the People to the horrors of radiation, but [CES.GetLeader] has offered some of his labour supply. "
NAV_military_start:0 "The Navajo Scouts"
NAV_military_start_desc:0 "The Navajo served as scouts during America's Indian wars, and returned to that role in the Wasteland. This tradition revived in the aftermath of the Great War, as the Navajo used their skills to hunt down bandits and raiders."
NAV_lessons_from_caesar:0 "Caesar's Lessons"
NAV_lessons_from_caesar_desc:0 "The People have a complicated relationship with Caesar's Legion, but few can deny there is much to learn from their army. For now."
NAV_warrior_traditions:0 "Help from the Medicine Men"
NAV_warrior_traditions_desc:0 "It is not enough to learn to kill the enemy. The People also learn to process the grief that comes with war; the smell of the dead, their rotting corpses. We can encourage our warriors to speak to medicine men about what they have seen, and conduct prayer songs and the Enemy Way Ceremony, and use peyote with other veterans to come to terms."
NAV_rainbow_arrows:0 "The Natsili'tka"
NAV_rainbow_arrows_desc:0 "The Hero Twins armed themselves with  natsili'tka, the rainbow arrows. Fortunately we can do the same today."
NAV_sign_language:0 "Plains Sign Language"
NAV_sign_language_desc:0 "There was a time when American Indians communicated with a common sign language, understanding each other even if they could not speak with words. Now we are among the last to know the old way. Good news for us, though!"
NAV_fight_some_more_forever:0 "I Will Fight Some More Forever"
NAV_fight_some_more_forever_desc:0 "The Navajo didn't survive the Comanche, 200 years of American oppression, a nuclear war, and the super-mutant migration to bend the knee to Caesar. We will bide our time and rise up!"
NAV_fight_some_more_forever_tt:0 "This will increase §RNavajo resistance§! by one."
NAV_happiness_servitude:0 "The Best Tribe in the Legion"
NAV_happiness_servitude_desc:0 "Critics would ask  what, apart from the roads and irrigation and public order, has [CES.GetName] done for us. But better to run with the wolves than to be a sheep."
NAV_happiness_servitude_tt:0 "This will set you on a path to gain autonomy, but you will remain part of the Legion."
NAV_hopi_coal_mines:0 "The Hopi Coal Mines"
NAV_hopi_coal_mines_desc:0 "The Hopi live within the People's territory, but relations between us have been fraught at times. If we are going to overthrow the Legion we will need to work with them, and the first step is to revive the old Kanyenta coal mine."
NAV_research_university:0 "The Oldest College in the Wastes"
NAV_research_university_desc:0 "The Diné College is the one of the only Institutes of higher learning to survive the Great War, offering students a hogan away from hogan. Perhaps it is time to expand opportunities at the school to others in the Wasteland?"
NAV_the_ladder:0 "The Great Ladder"
NAV_the_ladder_desc:0 "Before his death in 1893, Chief Hastinn Ch’il Haajiin met with some of his people who asked how to stand up to the Americans. In reply, he threw a handful of sand into the air, and said, 'that is how many of them there are. We cannot fight them, there are very few of us compared to them. We have to fight the injustices of our people with education. They have people out there called lawyers, doctors and engineers and that is how we will win the battle. Go and tell our people that education is the ladder.'"
NAV_women_warriors:0 "The Warrior Women"
NAV_women_warriors_desc:0 "Navajo women served in the US armed forces before the Great War, and continued to pick up a rifle after the bombs fell. This causes some discomfort with those in the Legion, but it's hard to argue with the results."
NAV_mormon_missionaries:0 "The Ways of the Canaanites"
NAV_mormon_missionaries_desc:0 "Some of the People converted to Mormonism even before the Great War, and Mormon farmers have settled our lands since the 19th century. Perhaps we can adopt some of their techniques."
NAV_hired_help:0 "Servants for the People"
NAV_hired_help_desc:0 "Like it or not, slavery is the cornerstone of much of the Wasteland. Although we will treat our servants with compassion, why shouldn't we do unto others as they have done unto us?"
NAV_market_economy:0 "The Market Economy"
NAV_market_economy_desc:0 "The Legion's unification of the American southwest has opened new business opportunities for us.  There was at time when every hill would have raiders behind it, but wherever the banner of the bull flies, our people are secure and honoured."
NAV_arms_shipments:0 "Arms Shipments"
NAV_arms_shipments_desc:0 "Some fools think the Legion abstains all technology. But there is a difference between overreliance and exploiting weapons. The workshops of Flagstaff churn out some of the most durable equipment in the Wastes, and they will serve us just as well as any Centurion."
NAV_insurgencies:0 "A History of Resistance"
NAV_insurgencies_desc:0 "The People outlasted the Anasazi, the Spanish, the Mexicans, and the Americans. We didn't survive the end of the Fourth World to bow to Caesar."

NAV_the_witch:0 "The Woman Who Changes"
NAV_the_witch_desc:0 "Some believe that Ahsonnuti, Changing Woman, gave birth to mankind using her old skin and soil. She guides Navajo women through puberty, and grows old with the seasons. [TTM.GetLeader] mimics many aspects of this goddess, so perhaps we can fool her into helping us."
NAV_black_mesa_hero:0 "The Hero of Black Mesa"
NAV_black_mesa_hero_desc:0 "A ghoul has patrolled the lands around Black Mesa since the bombs fell, protecting traders and the People from any and all oppression. Perhaps he will stand up to the Legion as well?"
NAV_wanamingo:0 "The Wanamingo"
NAV_wanamingo_desc:0 "Some Wastelanders believe we summoned the wanamingos for revenge on them for what the Great War did. Obviously that's a myth (or we would have summoned them long before), there is much to learn from these fearsome beasts."
NAV_heavy_artillery:0 "Fire Support"
NAV_heavy_artillery_desc:0 "Caesar brought the torch of civilization to the Wasteland.  Perhaps we can use some of that fire for ourselves."
NAV_hogans:0 "Hogan Is Where the Heart Is"

NAV_railroads:0 "The Navajo Rail"
NAV_railroads_desc:0 "It is time to revive the railway that once crossed the Navajo Reservation. But this time, it will not pass us by. We will become the hub of the Legion and the most prosperous land in the southwest."
NAV_reservation_system:0 "The Reservation System"
NAV_reservation_system_desc:0 "To the south lies [RES.GetName], a mysterious community of ghouls in the remains of Los Alamos. We have cautiously engaged in trading with them, but perhaps we should take a new approach."

NAV_invsetigate_slaves:0 "What Are they Doing With the Slaves?"
NAV_invsetigate_slaves_desc:0 "Recognizing that much of the Reservation is radioactive, it is still unclear why so many slaves go in to [LOS.Capital.GetName] and do not come out. Some of our scouts would like to investigate."
NAV_navajo_lets_make_a_deal:0 "Honour to A New Tribe"
NAV_navajo_lets_make_a_deal_desc:0 "Why should we criticize [RES.GetLeader] for his methods? He is looking out for his People, just as [NAV.GetLeader] looks out for his."
NAV_navajo_no_ghouls:0 "No More Reservations"
NAV_navajo_no_ghouls_desc:0 "The People's experience sadly makes them concerned when scientists plan to remove 'riff raff' and 'dregs' from the land. We're going to make sure this is the last reservation."

NAV_tribals_vs_settlers:0 "Remember When They Called us Tribals?"
NAV_tribals_vs_settlers_desc:0 "The Navajo are not unique to survive the Great War relatively unscathed.  The Yakama hold on in eastern Washington; the Uintah command lands of Eastern Utah; and, well, we don't talk about the Cherokee. Each one is a different people, but each recognizes that it wasn't their ancestors who dropped the bombs."
NAV_tribals_vs_settlers_tt:0 "§Y[NAV.GetNameWithFlag]§! will gain an opinion modifier with all other Native Americans on the map, and vice versa."
NAV_ute_trade:0 "Trade With the Utes"
NAV_ute_trade_desc:0 "The Uintah Reservation, located within the territory of the Eagle Rock tribals has been the home of the Utes for over four hundred years, and they are willing to cut a far better deal for Utah's wares than the merchant kings of New Canaan."
NAV_shoshone:0 "Take to the Skies"
NAV_shoshone_desc:0 "The Shoshone rule much of northern Idaho and Southern Idaho due to their control over the old Hot Springs Air Force Base. Perhaps they will sell us the right to examine the wreckage?"
NAV_mesa_verde:0 "Reclaim the Mesa"
NAV_mesa_verde_desc:0 "The Ciphers have camped out in Mesa Verde, treating a Native American site as their own. But perhaps we can find a use for them, as they adorn their homes and town with forgotten electronic schematics like a sacred art."
NAV_indian_outlaw:0 "Like an Indian Outlaw"
NAV_indian_outlaw_desc:0 "I'm an Indian outlaw, half Cherokee and Choctaw, My baby she's a Chippewa, She's one of a kind."
NAV_yakama:0 "As Long As the Grass Shall Grow"
NAV_yakama_desc:0 "They said that now and forever more that this was Indian land, \nAs long as the moon shall rise, \nOn the reservation there is much sadness now, \n Washington's treaty has been broken and there is no hope no how..."

NAV_handle_the_foragers:0 "Subdue the Foragers"
NAV_handle_the_foragers_desc:0 "Foragers are a vast nubmer of paroled and escaped convicts, living in the lands of Colorado. They ought to pick Dog City apart.

NAV_handle_the_foragers_2:0 "New Management"

NAV_dinetah_1_desc:0 "Dinétah is the traditional home of our people. We once ruled across Utah, Arizona, and Colorado, the land within the four mountains: Sis Naajini, Tsoodzil, Dookooshii, and Dibé Nitsaa. It is time to take our country back."
NAV_skinwalkers:0 "The Naaldlooshi"
NAV_skinwalkers_desc:0 "We tell stories of creatures who twist magic to evil, changing shape.  But in this fallen world, we have adopted their mantle to scare our enemies. Is that coyote in the bushes? You'd better hope so..."
NAV_iron_alliance:0 "Hire the Iron Alliance"
NAV_iron_alliance_desc:0 "The mercenaries of the Iron Alliance will sell their mothers for the right price. Good thing we can meet it."

NAV_bust_the_armour_open_desc:0 "There are some who call Caesar Tsetahotsiltali, He Who Kicks People Down the Cliff. He's gorged on Arizona and New Mexico, sucking its wealth and people into a vision of empire. It's time for this to end."

nav_colorado:0 "To the Colorado"
nav_colorado_desc:0 "Although the Navajo have not traditionally resided along the banks of the Colorado, there's no reason that can't change."
NAV_true_friend:0 "From Client to Ak’is"
NAV_true_friend_desc:0 "Our loyalty to the Legion has paid off. Although we are still 'subject' to the legion, in truth we are an equal of Caesar. "
ces_true_friend_tt:0 "Your §YLoyalty§! must be greater than §YResistance.§!"
NAV_train_anywhere:0 "Break Down the Trains"
NAV_train_anywhere_desc:0 "The Wasteland simply can't support continental railway right now. So why not turn the railyard into a scrapyard? "
