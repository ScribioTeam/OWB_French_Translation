  nf_bkb.1.t:0 "The Electorate's Index Fund"
  nf_bkb.1.d:0 "Before going public we were the connection between the outside world and the down-low ne'er-dowells of The Electorate. We invest their money, funnel their funds, and catch them up to speed on the progress of the outside technology. With this background many of our funds are tied up in endless debt intrests. This relationship improves the economies of both parties, but should we ever go-a knocking for our money, The Electorate will suffer immensely."

  nf_bkb.2.t:0 "Going Public"
  nf_bkb.2.d:0 "While our bank is much older than many of the currently standing wasteland nations, our history is still heavily entwined with that of The Electorals. When they raided the old western frontier of The Kingdom, we readily opened our doors and their accounts, mouths watering at the chance for new indebted debtors. But with the golden age of raidacy seemingly nearing its end, we leveraged our debt and friendships to secure a sovereign state and with it, we went public."
  nf_bkb.2.a:0 "Debt Bonds! Get'cha Bank Sanctioned Debt Bonds 'ere!"
  nf_bkb.3.t:0 "Threats of Liquidization"
  nf_bkb.3.d:0 "You don't gain this much power and wealth without stepping on a few toes, while normally not an issue, grudges in the wasteland often mean being tied up in a trunk or thrown in a river. This threat becomes ever so greater when caps are involved. Although The Electorate and Kingdom have some issues with allocation of money resources, Fort Cap Hell hate us for more ideological reasons, quoting speeches about the evils of loan sharks and endless servitude. Damn swamp police think their some kind of post-apocalyptic IRS."
