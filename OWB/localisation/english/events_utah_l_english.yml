  nf_utah.1.t:0 "Our Origins"
  nf_utah.1.desc:0 "In the ashes of the Old World, our only salvation was each other. As the centuries passed and humanity remade itself, our people were brought together and united by one common factor."
  nf_utah.1.a:0 "Our faith in the lord our god."
  nf_utah.1.b:0 "The unity of our tribe."

  nf_utah.2.t:0 "The New Gods"
  nf_utah.2.desc:0 "The blast wave slew the Old Gods, and even their memory would be lost as the fallout settled, but not every memory of the past was discarded, New Gods would be born from the rubble, and our people would find new purpose in their sanctification."
  nf_utah.2.a:0 "The Father, who showed us the way."
  nf_utah.2.b:0 "The War-Road, that gives all glory."

  nf_utah.3.t:0 "Our Path"
  nf_utah.3.desc:0 "As the final aftershocks of the end settle, the path our people must walk becomes clear. Two roads stretch out before, one, of isolation, shunning the outside world and all its horrors, the other, one of great risk, facing the new world head on, and daring to stand against its evils. What path shall our people walk?"

Despite this, our farmers have requested that new crops be sewn in our fields for the following season, replacing our traditional staples. The farmers claim this will help rejuvenate the soil, but it would be a clear sacrilege of our holy rights. What should we do?"

Though they tried to hide it well, their home is filled with gaudy baubles and disgusting non-essentials, a filth-ridden profanity to the austerity of our great mountain. There is no question that these possessions must be dealt with, but how should we dispose of these riches."

  nf_pantheon.70.a:0 "We will use these as he would want."

  nf_pantheon.71.t:0 "The Father's Teachings"

Members of our community have begun to argue that the father demands preparation and survival over all, while an equally vocal group have insisted that the father valued community and interdependence above all else.

A new member of the council is advocating for a reform to our battle formations, arguing for a rigid formation that can envelop the enemy over our traditional free-form melee. To restrain our warriors from the heat of battle in such a way will no doubt be unpopular, but the benefits of a proper battle strategy may grant us as-yet unattainable victories."
  nf_pantheon.80.a:0 "All that matters is the battle."

The leading commander in the field, rather than face the enemy head-on, retreated, leading the foe into a trap which utterly decimated them. While the victory was glorious, there can be no ignoring the fact that the general shirked from a head-first battle. Such an act of cowardice cannot be let off lightly."
  nf_pantheon.82.a:0 "He can no longer lead us."

  nf_pantheon.90.t:0 "Can We Forgive?"
  nf_pantheon.90.desc:0 "From across the Colorado and Utah, the Dead Horses are a beacon for those who have been cast from their societies. Amongst these refugees, many have come to shed their past sins, and live a new life amongst us. But can all sins be forgiven? Or are some trespasses too great for even God to forgive."
  nf_pantheon.90.a:0 "There must always be forgiveness."
  nf_pantheon.90.b:0 "We are God's judgement."

  nf_pantheon.91.t:0 "Mormon Influence"
  nf_pantheon.91.desc:0 "The Mormons have often travelled to our lands, offering supplies and teachings to whoever would hear them preach. Lately, however, their missionaries more forceful as of late, preaching of apocalypse and oncoming doom wherever they can be heard.

  nf_utah.176.desc:0 "We are not the only ones fighting for our survival against Heaven's Gate. [FROM.GetName], who are also fending off the steam-cultists, have requested that we form a full military alliance, in an effort to stop the advance of the Steam."
  nf_utah.176.a:0 "United we stand."
  nf_utah.176.b:0 "We are better off on our own."

  nf_utah.180.t:0 "The Anointed Ask for Mediation."
  nf_utah.180.desc:0 "The Anointed have proven themselves a valued friend in our time of need. Now, they come asking a favour for themselves. Our relationship with the Murtaugh Reformers is considerably better than their orthodox counterparts, and the Anointed have asked that mediate the schism between their people, in an attempt to mend the divide."
  nf_utah.180.a:0 "A noble goal, we accept."

  nf_utah.181.t:0 "Highchapel offers to mediate the Schism."
  nf_utah.181.desc:0 "The relationship between Highchapel and the Anointed has been a cause for concern amongst our people. This concern has risen markedly following a message from Highchapel, requesting that we attend a new council mediated by them, in an attempt to mend the schism. Many of our people suspect a trap, but this could be our only way of peaceful unification."
  nf_utah.181.a:0 "We will never reunite with those apostates."
  nf_utah.181.b:0 "If this will bring unity, we accept."

  nf_utah.182.t:0 "The Reformers Refuse!"
  nf_utah.182.desc:0 "Despite our olive branch of peace, the Schismatics have continued to persist in their heresy, there will be no unification but through war."
  nf_utah.182.a:0 "Stubborn fools."

  nf_utah.183.t:0 "The Council of New Nicea."
  nf_utah.183.desc:0 "In the year of our lord [ROOT.GetYear], a council of all the Lord's people have gathered, to mend the Schism of the Souls and to bring unity to the faithful. The Murtaugh Schismatics stand firm in their doctrine of soular immutability, and while agreeing to negotiate on the doctrinal matters of conversion and baptism, refuse to accept the orthodox position of soular Anointment. After a week of deliberation and theological pontification, the verdict of the council has been reached:"
  nf_utah.183.a:0 "Their reforms are reasonable, we accept."
  nf_utah.183.b:0 "We can only accept some of these changes."
  nf_utah.183.c:0 "A trap! capture these heretics and seize their land!"

  nf_utah.185.t:0 "The Anointed Demand Non-Interference."
  nf_utah.185.desc:0 "With the northern threat dealt with, The Anointed have turned their eyes once again to Murtaugh, knowing of our protection of their people, The Anointed have requested that we withdraw our support, that they may reunify their people through force."
  nf_utah.185.a:0 "Very well, we will not interfere."
  nf_utah.185.b:0 "We will join our brothers in victory!"
  nf_utah.185.c:0 "We cannot abandon Murtaugh."

  nf_utah.186.t:0 "Highchapel joins us!"
  nf_utah.186.desc:0 "In a welcome surprise, Highchapel has not only agreed to withdraw their protection of the schismatics, but to join us in a holy war against their heresy. Truly, the lord has blessed us with not only a great ally, but a dear and loyal friend."
  nf_utah.186.a:0 "Praise the Lord!"

  nf_utah.187.t:0 "Highchapel Refuses!"
  nf_utah.187.desc:0 "Despite all our sacrifices in fighting the steam-worshippers, Highchapel has abandoned us in favour of the schismatics, this betrayal is a shock to all our people, who had begun to view the baptisers not just as allies, but as true brothers in Christ."
  nf_utah.187.a:0 "Then they are heretics as well."

  nf_utah.188.t:0 "Surviving the Disease"
  nf_utah.188.desc:0 "After a hard-fought battle against the intangible evil of the Sickness-of-Soot, our people have finally prevailed. Our experience fighting the disease has significantly improved our medical knowledge, and our people are inspired by our survival."
  nf_utah.188.a:0 "What doesn't kill us makes stronger."

  nf_utah.189.t:0 "The Burned Man"
  nf_utah.189.desc:0 "Our tribe has begun hearing strange rumors of a Burned Man, and our people take strength in his message of just righteousness. Perhaps we'd do well to learn from his example?"
  nf_utah.189.a:0 "We shall stand up and look at what's come for us."
