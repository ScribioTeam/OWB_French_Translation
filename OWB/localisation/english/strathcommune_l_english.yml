  stc_new_constitution_desc:0 "If the §RCommune§! is to continue achieving its goals of defeating greed and capitalism then we must begin drafting a new constitution.

  stc_power_reserves:0 "Revitalizing Power Stations"
  stc_power_reserves_desc:0 "Canada's power lines once radiated with energy and heat. Now they lay dormant with little flowing through them but the vibrations the crows create when landing on them.

  str_hundred_flowers_bloom_desc:0 "The 1957 §4Hundred Flowers§! movement encouraged criticism of the Communist party and its policies in hopes of improvement.

The status quo the despot §RTeresee§! has put into practice must be flipped on its head by gathering the true opinion of the people through this renewed campaign."
  str_reverse_collectivization:0 "Reversing Collectivization"
  str_reverse_collectivization_desc:0 "Collectivization may have been a good idea on paper but it is a complete failure in practice.

  str_dissent_in_the_ranks_desc:0 "The §GArmy§! could be one of our greatest allies in the fight against the despot §RTeresee§!.

  str_focus_censorship_lifted:0 "Lifting Censorship"
  str_focus_censorship_lifted_desc:0 "§5Censorship§! has controlled our nation's political views for too long.

  str_sway_truckers:0 "Swaying the Truckers"
  str_sway_truckers_desc:0 "The §OTruckers§! control the supply to the army and hold a great deal of importance in the nation's supply chain. If we are to turn many of them to our side then we will have extreme ease in ensuring the tyrants are kept at bay."

  str_sway_army_desc:0 "The §GArmy§!'s dissidents may be on our side but the majority of its force still abide by the status quo upheld by the tyrant §RTeresse§!. We must deprogram some of them covertly through our loyal officers in the armed forces so their loyalty is assured."
  str_free_republic:0 "Our Free Republic"

### Events
  nf_strath.1.t:0 "The First Victims of Empire"
  nf_strath.1.d:0 "The Mexicans, the Filipinos, the Indians, all suffered under the American yoke. But never forget - it was Canada who suffered first, when they burned our capital in 1812. We tried to be friends, serving as comrades in the World Wars, but in the 21st century, their demands for our oil proved too much. To protect 'our security', they occupied our nation. Celebrating it a great victory for democracy, they used power armour and energy weapons on civilians, strip mined our resources, and used us to augment their war machine. \n\nThe bourgeoisie collaborated, convinced the Americans were too strong to oppose - and so resistance fell to to the anti-imperialist progressives of the Canadian Peoples Front. The Yukon Five; the Quebecois Quinze; and the Saskatchewan Six were but some of the cells that struck blows for the great cause! Armed by the Chinese, our guerillas were winning the war before the bombs fell."
  nf_strath.1.a:0 "We still maintain some of those stockpiles."
  nf_strath.1.b:0 "Thank God the Americans didn't get everything."

  nf_strath.2.t:0 "Treason Never Prospers"
  nf_strath.2.d:0 "The world ended in 2077, but the Canadian people did not. American occupiers tried to carve out warlord fiefdoms or flee home, while Canadian counterrevolutionaries advocated for unity. In the years that followed, the Canadian People's Front united Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. For a brief period our Mounted Police crossed the Rockies and approached Ronto. Canada's reunification seemed imminent, and we would have liberated the masses. Perhaps, in time, we could have even saved the Americans. \n\nBut it was not to be. Vermillion's party members deviated from Chairman Jiang thought, falling to the anarchist siren that tricked the people of Catalonia, Indonesia, and Sicily. They advocated for 'market reforms' which would have let capitalism back into our heartland, the same dark road that let the Americans in before the War. When the Party tried to restore order in Vermillion, its people, mystified by counterrevolutionary propaganda, rose up against it. And the CPF began to fall."
  nf_strath.2.a:0 "We will never forget,"
  nf_strath.2.b:0 "nor shall we ever forgive."

  nf_strath.3.t:0 "The Revolution Is Not Yet Lost!"
  nf_strath.3.d:0 "Amy Theresee was no coward. She was no soldier, but she stood at the front lines against the American Remnants. She pursued Revolutionary justice against the farmers who opposed collectivization. And she could inspire! She would labour alongside any worker, any miner, any gunsmith. Truly, it would be tougher, my child, to tell you what Amy could not do! Under the Chairwoman, life has become more joyous. The people labour gloriously, alert for any wreckers and traitors. But still, there is dissent.  Some question her motives, and argue for a peaceful approach to Vermillion. There is a word for these people - wreckers.  You aren't a wrecker, are you? \n\nStrathcommune spent the last ten years pursuing a rapid program of crash industrialization and collectivization, the same approach the left the Soviet Union to superpower status before the betrayals of the neoBukharanites of the 2020s.  Under the Chairwoman, Canada will be united. Canada will be free. And if there are those who question the camps, the police, and the conscription? They merely need a lesson in revolutionary values. "
  nf_strath.3.a:0 "They labour gloriously for the People's Army!"
  nf_strath.3.b:0 "They strive to better our lives."
  nf_strath.4.t:0 "Fire in the North"
  nf_strath.4.d.strathcommune:0 "What horror! Someone set off an ancient nuclear weapon up north near one of our rehabilitation camps, killing hundreds. Who could be so monstrous? The American bandits? Vermillion, eager to crush the masses? Or some other, malevolent factor? [STC.GetLeader] is certain it's the fault of [VER.GetLeader], but others wonder - could she have set it off to purge the Commune of dissidents? And if not them, then who? \n\n[STC.GetLeader] plans to go north to investigate, but paranoia lingers. If she flees, will counterrevolutionaries plot in the capital? \n\nBut others point out that the camp contained some of her greatest foes; people who criticized Big Sister and her rule of the Commune. Surely she wouldn't nuke her own people?"
  nf_strath.4.d.iron_confederacy:0 "Two hundred years after their death, America still stalks Canada.  The Americans once planted dozens of nuclear bombs in the Alberta tar sands to expedite oil mining - and it seems some of those bombs never went off.  Until today. Geiger counters spiked in the aftermath, and we all felt the tremor.  Perhaps this is one of the old American bombs, slumbering  beneath the ground? And if one went off, are others left?"
  nf_strath.4.d.vermillion:0 "We've received reports from the Iron Confederacy of a nuclear explosion up north! Someone must have set something off near one of the Strathcommune outposts. Could this have been [STC.GetLeader], to purge her enemies in a dramatic faction? We considered her mad, but this . . . this is too much!"
  nf_strath.4.d.other:0 "What happened? There are reports of an enormous explosion in northern [STC.GetName] territory. Accusations and rumours are flying. Was it a Commune secret weapon? A Vermillion attack? Or perhaps just the last gasp of the Americans. And even if there is a clear answer, who could trust the outcome?"
  nf_strath.4.d.enclave:0 "Good news! Before the Great War, America provided thousands of jobs to Canada through Operation Cauldron, a plan to extract oil from Alberta's tar sands through the use of tactical nuclear weapons. One of the unused bombs just went off. While the collateral damage was regrettable, perhaps this is a sign that there is still oil up there?"
  nf_strath.4.a:0 "Big Sister will get to the bottom of this!"
  nf_strath.4.b:0 "Those poor workers."
  nf_strath.4.c:0 "Well, hope they sort it out."
  nf_strath.4.e:0 "Perhaps Amy's is doing a bad job after all."
  nf_strath.4.enclave:0 "Perhaps the Canadarians still need our protectoin"

  nf_strath.5.t:0 "The Wreckers"
  nf_strath.5.d:0 "The preliminary results of our investigation are clear - the atomic bomb was set off by counterrevolutionary splitters from [VER.GetCapital]!. Let's demand an investigation - if [VER.GetLeader] is truly innocent, she will gladly let us inerrogate her officials and try them in the People's Court. \N\NBut to the Chairwoman, this is but the first step. The grave atrocity up north shows that the Splitters, Counterrevolutionaries, and wreckers cannot be trusted. It is time to reunite Canada by force."
  nf_strath.5.a:0 "Pursue the terrorists!"
  nf_strath.5.a_tt:0 "\nThis will unlock §Rthe Six Front War§!, a countdown to a war of all against all for the fate of Alberta.\n"

  nf_strath.6.t:0 "A Purge By Any Other Name"
  nf_strath.6.d:0 "Strathcommune demands the right to interrogate our High Command regarding the conduct up north. The Chairwoman has the audacity to believe *we* are behind the horror. We could give in to avoid bloodshed now, but this would open us up to a purge by the Chairwoman, and will cripple our army. But dare we say no? If we do, she will launch an assault, a prelude to a full fledged invasion."
  nf_strath.6.a:0 "War will only lead to barbarism!"
  nf_strath.6.b:0 "We will defend every meter of Canadian soil!"

  nf_strath.7.t:0 "Peace for Our Country"
  nf_strath.7.d:0 "[VER.GetLeader] was willing to concede to our demands. Although initially the Vermillion's leaders were reluctant to confess to their crimes, after sufficient time with the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs we've many of them confessed! A great victory for the people, no? \n\nbut of course, these confessions only show their culpability. We will crush Vermillion once and for all to make Canada safe for true socialism."
  nf_strath.7.a:0 "The only real power comes out of a long rifle."

  nf_strath.8.t:0 "An Arrogant Foe"
  nf_strath.8.d:0 "[VER.GetLeader] refused our just demands. We now face threats from enemies within and without- barbarous savages who would betray the Revolution. It is time to unite and save the Wasteland. And we can start by seizing a staging ground in Vermillion territory."
  nf_strath.8.a:0 "We look at an obviously impotent state."

  nf_strath.9.t:0 "Victory in Tofield!"
  nf_strath.9.d:0 "We've done it! We seized Tollfield, an important staging ground.  Moreover, we've hshown that the traitors of Vermillion are no match for Revolutionary justice. The struggle is not yet over, but we will soon finish the job."
  nf_strath.9.a:0 "Accelerate our plans!"

  nf_strath.10.t:0 "Revolutionary Martyrs"
  nf_strath.10.d:0 "To our lasting regret, many heroes of the Revolution did not survive the battle for Tofield. Our forces were forced to pull back, to our great dismay.  But remember, we always crushed our enemies, and will defeat the fascists too."
  nf_strath.10.a:0 "Our whole path will be sung in song."

  nf_strath.11.t:0 "Revolutionary Martyrs"
  nf_strath.11.d:0 "To our lasting regret, many heroes of the Revolution did not survive the battle for Tofield. But remember, we always crushed our enemies, and will defeat the fascists too."

  nf_strath.12.t:0 "They Shall Not Pass!"
  nf_strath.12.d:0 "'Bring us Amy's balls,' the men shouted. Alas, she had none. A good thing too, or she might have won at Tofield.'"
  nf_strath.12.a:0 "A victory for socialism."

  nf_strath.13.t:0 "They Shall Not Grow Old"
  nf_strath.13.d:0 "'We all honour the heroes who fought in the Great War. The people who fought for freedom and for the people. But it is a shame, is it not, that some do not anymore? Let us end this charade, and save Canada!"
  nf_strath.13.a:0 "This is the end of the beginning."
