  vault_brain_3:0 "\"Loyal\" Citizens"
  vault_brain_3_desc:0 "Incentivize self-policing and tattle-tail behaviours and the rats will reveal themselves. The most loyal of citizens are given special treatments, usually exception from the Brain's super mutant drafts..."

  vault_brain_2:0 "Control Apparati"
  vault_brain_2_desc:0 "Psychically powered headgear allow The Brain to monitor our citizen's thoughts directly! No one is safe from his gaze, and even now we have citizens reporting more and more loyal thoughts."

  vault_first_1:0 "Reinforce the Old Ways"
  vault_first_1_desc:0 "Vault City has survived this long by sticking to rules and regulations. Social change is a fool's errand in this new world, we must reinforce our existing systems and crack down on those seeking to change it."

  vault_first_2:0 "R&D Departments"
  vault_first_2_desc:0 "If Vault City is to become a model for what the new world shall be, we must first create that new world! For to long have we rested on the technology of old, now we must push forward and innovate, for the future of mankind!"

  vault_first_3:0 "Population Controls"
  vault_first_3_desc:0 "Vault City is always growing, and there are endless streams of people wishing to join our utopia. By losing intellectual requirements, but increasing moral and mental screenings, we might better assess who is worthy of being a citizen."

  vault_chief_2:0 "Security Protocols"
  vault_chief_2_desc:0 "Our method of security is out to date, and focused to heavily on the use of turrets to protect the city. If Vault City is to remain safe, we are going to need superior guards. New training and recruitment regulations should aid in this area."

  vault_chief_3:0 "Advanced Protocols"
  vault_chief_3_desc:0 "Defending a location is more than just being a superior warrior, it's about having a superior mastery of your environment. All security personnel shall be given extensive training in the defensive locations of the city, the courtyard, and the immediate area."

  vault_chief_4a:0 "Quantity"
  vault_chief_4a_desc:0 "The quantity of our soldiers and their weapons is an important feature in our doctrine. Overwhelming firepower is key to defeating our foes, and to achieve this we must first gain overwhelming superiority."

  vault_chief_4b:0 "Quality"
  vault_chief_4b_desc:0 "Guns and armour are all well and good, but to truly contest a battlefield, you must control it on land and in the air. Machines are the new way of war."

  vault_festus_1:0 "Ghoul Conferences"
  vault_festus_1_desc:0 "Vault City is ours after all these years of Bigotry, but even now the revolutionary leaders are falling apart due to infighting! Festus has elected to simply run vault city as it was formerly run, by a council. Though this time? You have to be a ghoul to earn a seat."

  vault_festus_2:0 "Ghoul Haven"

  vault_festus_4a:0 "Old World Ideals"
  vault_festus_4a_desc:0 "We remember how things used to be; well some of us do. Those ideals made us great and powerful, and while there are so many pretenders (the NCR and others), we were the citizens of America. We 'are' America; what's left of it."

  vault_festus_4b:0 "Old World Architects"
  vault_festus_4b_desc:0 "Back in the day, we built great things. Towers and monuments, cities and civil works. We raised the mightiest armies and put low our greatest foes. Let's rebuild that world, starting today."

  vault_tribals:0 "Vault-Tec Calling"
  vault_tribals_desc:0 "For too long have we sat by in our Utopian city, for too long have we waited and rested. Now is the time for action! Expansion! Vault Tec is calling."

  vault_80s:0 "Road Warrior Diplomacy"
  vault_80s_desc:0 "Our past confrontations with the 80's tribe ended in disaster, with our security forces being overrun while attempting to keep them from advancing down the I-80. Now we must seek to amend the past, let us call their warchief, Thunderbird, for Parley."

  vault_80s_roam:0 "Let Them Roam"
  vault_80s_roam_desc:0 "What the 80's truly desire is freedom to travel up and down the I-80, which they worship as some strange type of spiritual guide. We may be able to give them access to the road in order to end hostilities."

  vault_i80:0 "Just a Road"
  vault_i80_desc:0 "The formal surrender of the Vault City section of the I-80 will be a great step forward in our relationship with the 80's, and more importantly, in debt them to us spiritually."

  vault_80s_gift:0 "Gifts from the Road"
  vault_80s_gift_desc:0 "The 80's have come to us with tribute, honouring our agreements with trade and other agreements. Even now, a number of their warriors have applied for semi-permanent residency status in the courtyard."

  vault_80s_help:0 "Raise the Road Warriors"
  vault_80s_help_desc:0 "We have done great things for the 80's in the past, and now they should return that favour in kind. In honour of our past agreements and good relationships, we ask them to aid us in this conflict."

  vault_80s_blockade:0 "Blockade the I-80"
  vault_80s_blockade_desc:0 "No more! Our meeting with Thunderbird was a disaster, and to that point we have elected to close off the road itself. No more shall we let the 80's bully our merchants and harass our trade routes."

  vault_80s_violence:0 "Preemptive Violence"
  vault_80s_violence_desc:0 "We can not wait for the 80's to attack us. We must attack them! Overwhelm our foes before they have prepared their warriors for this conflict."

  vault_flock:0 "Cull the Flock"
  vault_flock_desc:0 "The warriors of the Pale Folk's tribe have been the nightmare of central nevada for decades, launching nightly raids on caravans and outlying settlements in their endless hunt for supplies. Like raiders, they survive by taking, and like raiders, they should be dealt with swiftly and with extreme violence."

  vault_flock_diagnose:0 "Diagnose Their Condition"
  vault_flock_diagnose_desc:0 "Our doctors have spent several weeks studying the condition of the Pale Folk, who seem to sport a uniform genetic disposition to albinism. That is to say, they are all albino, and overwhelmingly sensitive to the sun. Some of their number have been taken for less than noble experimentation."

  vault_flock_goggles:0 "Share Our Goggles"
  vault_flock_goggles_desc:0 "The Pale Folk are, by in large, incapable of going out during the day due to their their extreme light sensitivity. This has made them somewhat incapable allies, due to this severe limitation. A simple solution has been proposed however; we shall give them our vast surplus of Vault Tec Goggles."

  vault_flock_help:0 "Raise the Flock"
  vault_flock_help_desc:0 "The Folk owe us a debt they can never understand, and we like to make sure they remember that. In times of war? We can call on them to repay that debt, little by little."

  vault_flock_annex:0 "Subterranean Subjugation"
  vault_flock_annex_desc:0 "The Pale Folk have lived in a series of underground complexes and caverns for the better part of a hundred years, and have remained elusive as a result. If we are to bring them to heel, we shall need to subjugate these long unreachable enclaves."

  vault_flock_filters:0 "Purify the Flock"
  vault_flock_filters_desc:0 "We have determined that much of why the Pale Folk are the way they are is due to their heavily irradiated sources of water. The purification process, while costly, should free up vast reservoirs of water, and water is something wastelanders are always willing to pay top dollar for."

  vault_flock_brain:0 "Pale Giants"
  vault_flock_brain_desc:0 "My lord! The illustrious brain has demanded warriors for his conquests! It is time to gather some of these pathetic pale manlings and drag them into the vats!"

  vault_cyclops:0 "Eye for an Eye"
  vault_cyclops_desc:0 "The Cyclops tribe are warlike and violent in the extreme, a spartan culture that demands them to go forth to kill beasts and men to prove their place. They have never dared attack the walls of Vault City, but they have been a bane on our outlying communities and trade for as long as we can remember. Let us return the favour? An eye for an eye..."

  vault_cyclops_eager:0 "Eager Warriors"
  vault_cyclops_eager_desc:0 "Despite having been bested by us, the Cyclops tribe remains surprisingly jovial? They are willing to fight for us, so long as we are willing to provide them with the means of battle..."

  vault_cyclops_fort:0 "Developing Old Fort"
  vault_cyclops_fort_desc:0 "The Conquered Cyclops tribe operated out of a large spanish mission, and it appears that not far from them? One can find a series of prewar mines in relatively good condition. Reopening them will be key in our operations going into the future."

  vault_cyclops_hounds:0 "Hounds of the North"
  vault_cyclops_hounds_desc:0 "The Cyclops tribe has fallen into a state of full subservience, and eagerly seek to do battle on our behalf. Loyal allies, or servants? It's hard to say, but even now. They rally to our side."

  vault_cyclops_help:0 "Promote Polyphemus"
  vault_cyclops_help_desc:0 "Polyphemus, the former leader of the Cyclops Tribe, is eager to aid is in whatever way we can. He asks that we let him leads his own men and then some. While many hold reservations about this, it can be said that he has been doing this for far longer than any of our commanders..."

  vault_cyclops_serve:0 "Forced Servitude"
  vault_cyclops_serve_desc:0 "The Cyclops controlled far more land than one would imagine for a relatively small and warlike community. Their spirit is strong, and must be broken. A few generations of forced servitude should do just the trick..."

  vault_cyclops_army:0 "Cyclops of Old"
  vault_cyclops_army_desc:0 "My lord! We have read stories, old books, thought records! Of the Cyclops, massive one eyed monsters who did terrible things to mankind! Is it not fitting that the brain should also have such warriors at his disposal? Such monsters?"

  vault_utopia:0 "The Utopian City"
  vault_utopia_desc:0 "Vault City is more than a place, it's an idea. A post war Utopia rising from the wastes! We are above all those around us for a reason, and it is for those same reasons that so many flock to this place, desperate to get even a smidgen of the glorious technology we have at our disposal."

  vault_med_reg:0 "Courtyard Medical Regulation"
  vault_med_reg_desc:0 "Many of the people that come to the courtyard come seeking the trickle down effect of our medical capabilities. We can't offer each and every person that asks a replacement limb, our ability make promises and quietly sterilize those too mutated to be of further use means we have excellent population control..."

  vault_draft:0 "Institute Courtyard Draft"
  vault_draft_desc:0 "The seething hordes in the courtyard are viewed by many as little more than an annoyance, a leech upon our resources. It might be true that more goes into them than they give back, but what they are is a ready pool of manpower, a meat shield against the horrors of the wasteland."

  vault_mil_sec:0 "Security Militarization"
  vault_mil_sec_desc:0 "The Security forces centred around Vault City have long been incapable of acting as a proper military outfit. Due in part to fears that they might overtake the city government, and because before there was never a need to expand rapidly. Now however? We find ourselves in need of organized training."

  vault_citizen:0 "Service for Citizenship"
  vault_citizen_desc:0 "Our greatest ability to call the common masses to arms is the promise of citizenship within the immaculate walls of Vault City. For them and their families in the future."

  vault_robo_sec:0 "Automated Security"
  vault_robo_sec_desc:0 "While recruitment is a viable option, many within Vault City would rather focus on the production of robotic guardians, due in no small part to their use meaning we don't have to hire and promise anything to the masses in the courtyard."

  vault_serv_1:0 "The Future of Servants"
  vault_serv_1_desc:0 "Servants have been integral to Vault City for as long as we can remember, desperate souls willing to sell themselves into pseudo-slavery for a chance at seeing the inside of our walls. However, times are changing, and there are rumblings of servants requesting workers' rights and reduced hours... "

  vault_serv_2:0 "Quality of Service"
  vault_serv_2_desc:0 "Many of our true citizens have complained about the steadily decreasing quality of servant work. Regulations and tests could be put in place to ensure that only the most skilled servants can get into the city. This would reduce the volume of our workforce, but many would say that it's worth it to keep true citizens happy."

  vault_serv_3:0 "Service Hours"
  vault_serv_3_desc:0 "We have been overworking our servants for decades now, notably our physical labourers who do tasks far away from the city proper, working as scavengers and resource gatherers. Working them as hard as we do has allowed us to thrive, but discontent among workers is running high...do we reduce work hours?"

  vault_downtown:0 "Renovate Downtown"
  vault_downtown_desc:0 "Downtown is the heart of our economy proper, and houses the vast majority of our skilled labour and services. Renovation for it is near constant, with much of our yearly budget going to expansion and subsidies."

  vault_courtyard:0 "Modernize Courtyard"
  vault_courtyard_desc:0 "The Courtyard has grown into a sprawling city in its own right, housing thousands of souls. It is also incredibly out of date, for it is a glorified ghetto with a crumbling infrastructure."

  vault_sec_station:0 "Security Station"
  vault_sec_station_desc:0 "Monitoring local radio waves and housing much of the guard, the Security Station is the closest thing we have to a military headquarters, and as such, must be a proper fortress."

  vault_wall:0 "Expand the Wall"
  vault_wall_desc:0 "Vault City is growing like the cities of old, and it has recently been pointed out that the vast majority of our people live far from our protective fortifications. A new layer of walls must be created to protect that which we've invested so much in."

  vault_second_city:0 "Integrate Courtyard"
  vault_second_city_desc:0 "The Courtyard problem has been troubling us for generations, for its citizens have been treated as second class all the while. The choice to integrate them into the city proper, proclaiming them a literal, but slightly superior second class should placate them for a time."

  vault_gem:0 "Gem of the Wasteland"
  vault_gem_desc:0 "Who can compare to the utopia that is Vault City? None and nothing! There are none with such innovative thoughts, such magnificent people, and such glorious technology as us. We are the Gem of the Wasteland, the last true oasis of the old world in a sea of broken, twisted metal. Let it be known to all!"

  vault_riperult:0 "Face Masher"
  vault_riperult_desc:0 "Face Masher, the killer of Crescent Valley, The Scourge of Duckwater, plagues the wastes to our south. Local legends speak of a hidden mountain city with clean water and fertile green land in his domain. We must destroy this dreg of society and take these resources for ourselves."

  vault_rip_puppet:0 "Saving Face"
  vault_rip_puppet_desc:0 "Face Masher shares many values with us. He protects his own, is suspicious of the outside world, and is willing to get his hands dirty to keep his people safe. His people are also severely mistrusting of us. Maybe, inducting Masher as a full citizen can help us work toward bringing them properly under our control."

  vault_rip_pop:0 "The Riperult Militia"
  vault_rip_pop_desc:0 "Now that the Riperult have started to come around to our control of them, allowing their population to form their own military might be a viable option."

  vault_rip_crescent:0 "Fertile Crescent"
  vault_rip_crescent_desc:0 "The hidden, life sustaining valley that the Riperult protected, now clear of their raider influence, is more than ready to be seeded with our own citizens and claimed in the name of Vault City."

  vault_rip_water:0 "Waters of Life"
  vault_rip_water_desc:0 "The relatively untouched prewar crops that grow freely in the Crescent can be adapted for use in the Vault-Tec designed growing bays of our facilities. This will give us a more reliable and nourishing food source for our people."

  vault_new_reno:0 "The Lights Went Off in Reno"
  vault_new_reno_desc:0 "New Reno was always a hive of scum and villainy, but Thradd's coup is a step too far. We have to stop his army before he comes for us!"

  vault_advancement_through_isolation:0 "Advancement Through Isolation"
  vault_advancement_through_isolation_desc:0 "If we were to side with another faction it would mean letting our enemies have access to our strongest technology! We need to keep these secrets close to heart and use this technology to protect our independence from outsiders."

  vault_enemies_of_enemies:0 "Common Foes"
  vault_enemies_of_enemies_desc:0 "The threat from the East is a problem for all of the civilized world. Even if New California's run by ignorant fools, they are a far better neighbour than the raiders of Utah or the Legion. Perhaps we should work together to defend the torch of civilization."

  vault_brotherhood_pact_of_steel:0 "The Pact of Steel"
  vault_brotherhood_pact_of_steel_desc:0 "New California wants to rule the entire west coast. Shady Sands covets our technology and, if we stand on our own, we will surely fall. But the Desert Rangers and the Brotherhood of Steel will work together for peace, order, and progress."

  vault_new_reno_brain:0 "More Land for the Brain"
  vault_new_reno_brain_desc:0 "Vault City was a good start, but New Reno is far more populous. So much more raw material to work with!"

  vault_something_greater:0 "Something Greater"
  vault_something_greater_desc:0 "Recently, a new faction has emerged. The "Nevada Pact". All of the other groups have their own downsides, their own ambitions or wants that we would be surrendering Vault City to if we were to join them. The only way to preserve our independence is to join the Nevada Pact!"
