  ver_tech_placeholder:0 "PLACEHOLDER"
  ver_all_hail_the_infantry:0 "§7All Hail The Infantry§!"
  ver_all_hail_the_infantry_desc:0 "War has shifted innumerable times throughout the millenia of human history, but one constant has always remained.   No new addition has removed them, nor for the purposes it is often waged can anything realistically do so.\n\nThe infantry march across all of humanity's efforts, and shall do so to time immemorial.  Our army can adapt and act as many forces, with many plans doctrines and branches, but it is all for the purpose of those who hold the ground, and secure the end."
  
  ver_birthplace_of_a_future:0 "Birthplace Of A Future"
  ver_birthplace_of_a_future_desc:0 "Our people's story begins long ago, in the old Dominion, around the turn of the Second World War.  Political shifts had long been coming to the Prairies, but the actions of William Aberhart and his successors of the Social Credit party, and their merger with the Canadian Commonwealth Federation, set the road our ancestors walked until the fires consumed them."
  
  ver_martyrs_of_our_movement:0 "Martyrs Of Our Movement"
  ver_martyrs_of_our_movement_desc:0 "The Supremacy Acts of 2035 were the first stab of betrayal by the bourgeois government of Canada against the Prairies.  Selling off our resources and industry to American actors at-will for the purposes of anti-communist actions, it was clear we were never going to be welcome as an equal partner from those days on.  While we were in no position to openly declare independence, we did take direct action against the occupiers for the decades until the Front formed.  Many great revolutionary actors lost their lives during this time.  We remember several, but one more than most."
  
  ver_fuck_around_and_find_out:0 "§tFUCK AROUND AND FIND OUT§!"
  ver_fuck_around_and_find_out_desc:0 "Enough is enough, if Teresee wishes to see the realm go up in flames, we shall not sit idly by and wait for her to light the tinder.  \n\nIt is time to prepare the Union for war, \n§tand it is time to end this sham.§!"
  
  ver_resign_potash_for_guns:0 "Re-Sign The Potash For Guns Agreement"
  ver_resign_potash_for_guns_desc:0 "First signed with the Governate of Stoon in 2254, the Potash For Guns accords have kept our farmers well supplied with necessary fertilizers and agricultural goods we have been unable to branch into manufacturing as of yet.   It is time to reup these agreements, so that even as some of our armament production may go east, it will not lead to starvation in a potential war."
  
  ver_reorganize_the_reserve_rolls:0 "Reorganize The Reserve Rolls"
  ver_reorganize_the_reserve_rolls_desc:0 "Castle's handling of military matters before Jure's arrival was, to say the least, a travesty.   In essence the actual records of possible reservists and enlisteds for the militia were completely left to chance for decades.  Now that Jure has done the necessary work of purging these outdated records, it's time to officialize the new ones."
  
  ver_administering_to_necessity:0 "Administering To Necessities"
  ver_administering_to_necessity_desc:0 "While living in the Union is hardly the worst conditions in the post apocalypse, it could be better.   Calling ourselves communist and yet having people's needs remain unmet is a black stain on our society, and we'll need to put pressure anything at hand to end that scenario going forward."
  
  ver_alternatives_to_energy_imports:0 "Alternatives To Energy Imports"
  ver_alternatives_to_energy_imports_desc:0 "Even if we were to end our grid's strain tomorrow, it is not truly secure as long as we rely on imports through what could one day be hostile territory.   Thankfully, the last year has seen work on new river generators, and some promising projects lie in the future."
  
  ver_manage_the_growing_grid:0 "Manage The Growing Grid"
  ver_manage_the_growing_grid_desc:0 "With the Wainwright industrial base having been built for the Redmond grid's output, the power network we have here was underprepared for it's addition.  The last year has seen additional generators and wirelaying done, and while not yet perfect, the major problems are beginning to fade."
  
  ver_all_quiet_on_the_western_front:0 "All Quiet On The Western Front"
  ver_all_quiet_on_the_western_front_desc:0 "While it seems inevitable that one day yet there may come conflict, for now the plains lie peaceful.   Teresee blusters her heart out, sure, but it has not yet led to actual hostilities.   We can only hope this pattern holds."
  
  ver_what_are_we_being_blamed_for_now:0 "What Are We Being Blamed For Now"
  ver_what_are_we_being_blamed_for_now_desc:0 "A nuclear warhead.\nThe damnable American project to seizxe our oil couldn't leave well enough alone it seems.   Now it has Teresee blaming us, which would be unsurprising if it wasn't the pinnacle of insanity and insult.  She knows as well as we what the Americans did to us long ago, and yet chooses to exacerbate the tensions between us."
  
  ver_reinforce_our_logistics_systems:0 "Reinforce Our Logistics Systems"
  ver_reinforce_our_logistics_systems_desc:0 "The roads and rails that yet remain for us to use are in poor shape for what we need going forward.   A fight with Strathcommune will not end in a week of short protracted firefights, and we would do best to get this network up to snuff before it comes down on us."
  
  ver_kickstart_the_exercises:0 "Kickstart The New Exercises"
  ver_kickstart_the_exercises_desc:0 "It's time these various branches of our military actually trained alongside each other.   How the hell you called yourselves allies for 30 years without ever seemingly having done this is patently absurd.   Castle can whine all he wants, the monster next door breathes louder than he does."
  
  ver_prepare_hope:0 "Hope For The §MBest§!, Prepare For The §RWorst§!"
  ver_prepare_hope_desc:0 "While it's not our intent to create any panic, the fact remains the future is uncertain.  Military equipment that was loaned out to farmers and others will have to be requisitioned for the time being in case of what may come.  It seems the potential war and Jure's assurances are enough for now, let us not let it lead to failing them."
  
  ver_streamline_the_distributed_standards:0 "Streamline The Distributed Standards"
  ver_streamline_the_distributed_standards_desc:0 "The CPF's leaders often scoffed at our networked decentralized industrial methods, and yet they provided the best work the uprising saw from our region.  One does not have to simply throw up their hands and let standards slip, and we shall continue to prove it ever more."
  
  ver_restart_the_other_trades:0 "Restart The Other Trades"
  ver_restart_the_other_trades_desc:0 "While the future could see it cut off for a time, it is good for us to open back up to trade.  We can hardly source everything we could ever need in our small territory, and trade between factions doesn't leave a surplus for an olgarch to skim, it's take it or leave it."
  
  ver_a_long_desired_expansion:0 "A Long Desired Expansion"
  ver_a_long_desired_expansion_desc:0 "Plans for these additional workshops have laid dusty for some time, but with the issues on our industry lessening, they could be put into rapid production."
  
  ver_an_always_adapting_industry:0 "An Always Adapting Industry"
  ver_an_always_adapting_industry_desc:0 "Industry, like soldiery, cannot remain stagnant.   Everything changes with time, and so must how we live and provide our needs to do so.  Some agreed upon funding and research can carry a lot of weight if done long enough in advance, and the councils have seen fit to do so."
  
  ver_ever_more_for_ever_less:0 "§MEver More For Ever Less§!"
  ver_ever_more_for_ever_less_desc:0 "As our situation improves, so does the effort lessen that we need to improve it.   Labor is king of all it creates, and it can create more as it creates.  Our efforts in industry and the workers have come to fruition since Jure's return."
  
  ver_to_grasp_tomorrow:0 "To Grasp Tomorrow"
  ver_to_grasp_tomorrow_desc:0 "One could say they were dreaming, the techniques and power of the world before have returned to us."
  
  ver_dont_even_recognize_ourselves:0 "Don't Even Recognize Ourselves"
  ver_dont_even_recognize_ourselves_desc:0 "As the skylight burns and our people march onward, one could not look back at the recent past and recognize what we were even a short time ago."
  
  ver_amp_up_live_fire:0 "Amp Up The Live Fire Scenarios"
  ver_amp_up_live_fire_desc:0 "While needing more planning and control, live fire is the only way to truly prepare a recruit for what is to come.   Throwing a rock and pointing a fencepost around only gets you so far."
  
  ver_the_manufacturing_legacy:0 "§GThe Manufacturing Legacy§!"
  ver_the_manufacturing_legacy_desc:0 "Our legacy from the Uprising years remains the CARMA network built throughout our region.   While not a centralized powerhouse that was the Redmond underground city, it has it's earned reputation for quality work done over great distances. It still lives with us, even if age, time, and wear have done a number on it."
  
  ver_the_CA-RM2:0 "The CA-RM2"
  ver_the_CA-RM2_desc:0 "While a long backlogged project, the gunsmith's union has finally provided a true successor to our current arms.   The Crimson Arms - Repeater Medium (Model 2) can be put into production with only a modest investment of research and bluepringt work."
  
  ver_towards_a_proper_mortar:0 "Towards A Proper Mortar"
  ver_towards_a_proper_mortar_desc:0 "A true indirect fire support method is still an uncommon sight anywhere in the wasteland, but our efforts push for it to return one day.   For now, improved high explosive equipment will suffice."
  
  ver_better_bang_for_the_buck:0 "Better Bang For The Buck"
  ver_better_bang_for_the_buck_desc:0 "It stands to reason those who work with tools would be able to describe how to make better tools, and with a now finished writeup by several union leaders and a few of our engineers, it seems we have a much more worthwhile set of designs to put into eventual use."

  ver_the_mag_gun_bears_fruit_desc:0 "PLACEHOLDER LOCALIZATION"
  
  ver_a_necessary_detente:0 "A Necessary Detente"
  ver_a_necessary_detente_desc:0 "While nobody wishes to give Teresee anything, the sad fact is we are yet unprepared to face her army.   Caleb Cydin has volunteered to take the blame on her stand, so as to spare much of our people a horrific fate.  We salute his sacrifice, and shall not let it go to waste."
  
  ver_may_you_rot_in_hell:0 "§RMay You Burn In Hell§!"
  ver_may_you_rot_in_hell_desc:0 "Teresee can take this utter bullshit and shove it.   It seems she wants to burn the CPF's remnants down over a tantrum and drag us along.\n\nWe'll humor her for about 6 feet. \n\nAnd no further."
  
  ver_tragedy_great_tragedy:0 "§gTragedy, Great Tragedy§!"
  ver_tragedy_great_tragedy_desc:0 "One could hardly describe the events that have transpired.  Within the cryogenic facility underneath our city laid many forgotten victims of the American's sick experiments, recorded on site as prototypes for use in their Vault system.  However, one pod was listed as only recently having passed away from lack of life support, the rest having long preceded it.  \n\nIt contained what turned out to be Jure's Grandfather, his disappearance over two centuries ago seemingly explained, now having ended just days from having been able to save him.  We can only hope the record is wrong and we did not miss such a thing by a margin so heartbreaking, but as the world has shown, time knows naught but creulty."
  
  ver_a_beautiful_reunion:0 "§MA Beautiful Reunion§!"
  ver_a_beautiful_reunion_desc:0 "One could hardly describe the events that have transpired.  Within the cryogenic facility underneath our city laid a man long forgotten, a soldier of the old Canadian Army, a known sympathizer to our cause, and inspiration for the Immortal Soldier mythology.  As well, as Jure has shown with great emotion, her Grandfather, his disappearance over two centuries ago seemingly explained.  Already incredibly advanced in age, he now commands longevity unknown to any but ghouls.   One can only hope he recovers fully, and can join us in the fight for the future."
  
  ver_what_lied_beneath_our_home:0 "What Lay Beneath Our Home"
  ver_what_lied_beneath_our_home_desc:0 "It is scarcely believable what we have found, especially underneath the very city we have called home.   An American in place bunker, with many strange tubes and offgrid generators.   What on earth could that place have been for?"
  
  ver_the_long_collapse:0 "The Long Collapse"
  ver_the_long_collapse_desc:0 "At the culmination of the Uprising, we liberated the city of Winnipeg in the early hours of October 23rd. We would not get to spend the night in celebration.   The years that followed held some measure of hope, until the Winter came.   \n\nDark and punshing, it lay on us for 26 long years, killing far more than the bombs did, or possibly even could have.  In the decades that followed, the CPF gradually shed it's regions of control.   \n\nFrom the Manitoban Kingdom that took up control of the eastern half of the Prairies, to the insularity of the gladiatorial Electorals, the cult that would become the Stampede, or our retreat northward from the monsters that surround Calgary.  \n\nThe retreat left many behind, unfed, and unrecompensed, these would never return to the CPF, and later banded under an old American solider's leadership to spite the CPF at it's borders for the decades since.   The last blow would come when the Iron Confederacy would secede from the CPF's control, convinced the leadership was more interested in maintaining a clique of self interested failsons than a government.  We followed soon after, with the Wainwright Garrison refusing to march on us, and from there the shattered state we see now was born."
  
  ver_the_rose_returns:0 "Our Rose Returns"
  ver_the_rose_returns_desc:0 "Early on the morning of February 12th, 2274, a face we all thought never to be seen again returned to the Union.   Domina Jure, a commander of several brigades from our ancestors here, came back from nearly two centuries of travel as a wandering military soldier and leader.  With her presence and the growing tensions on the Strathcommunal border, the off again on again proposal of Union between us and Wainwright was finally officialized."
