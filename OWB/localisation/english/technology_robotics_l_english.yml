  robot_automation_tech:0 "Automation"
  robot_automation_tech_desc:0 "Advancements in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence could be put to great use. Increasing our industrial capabilities by installing simple mechanical arms able to weld, bolt and generally man a basic assembly line will speed up our production rate, while such research also opens the way for very interesting military applications."
  robot_makeshift_automatons_tech:0 "Automatons"
  robot_makeshift_automatons_tech_desc:0 "The equivalent of industrial machinery given a simple propulsion system, two sub-caliber machineguns and a scrap metal shell covering sensitive parts, those \"scrap bots\" will still provide a tactical advantage in the form of an expendable shock trooper, an industrial-capacity reliant way to bolster our depleted divisions and an armored shield that our troops can take cover behind during assaults."
  robot_build_efficiency_tech_1:0 "Dedicated Mechanics"
  robot_build_efficiency_tech_1_desc:0 "While our mechanized units are aced their initial examination in the field, their sheer complexity heavily limits us to utilize them in a wider sense. If we truly want to use them as our frontline units, we'll have to organize designated personnel for their maintenance and assembly. This, however, will heavily tie up our accessible human resources."
  robot_build_efficiency_tech_2:0 "Improved Manufacturing"
  robot_build_efficiency_tech_2_desc:0 "As we become more and more dependent on our robotic allies the more they drain our available resources. Further funding will be relocated for developing our manufacturing process, and even more, people will be sorted into mechanist roles - which means we'll lose even more people from other areas, where talent may be needed."
  robot_build_efficiency_tech_3:0 "Peak Efficiency"
  robot_build_efficiency_tech_3_desc:0 "Slowly, but surely, everybody from our nation will be sorted into our workshops and will construct more and more robots, just for our protection. Twelve-hour extended shifts, with replacements at the ready, with the keenest of our overseers - this is peak efficiency. What are some lives wasted next to an assembly line, if we can save lives being wasted on the battlefield?"
  robot_miniature_thruster_tech:0 "Thruster Engines"
  robot_miniature_thruster_tech_desc:0 "Thruster engines allowed pre-war robots to move easily over rough terrain, while also increasing their speed in contrast to bulky servo-driven predecessors. And while the complex system of counter-thrusters, gyroscope and main reactor device makes it more costly to produce than we would like, they will be very useful scout, flanking troops, and skirmishing divisions."
  robot_fission_batteries_tech:0 "Fission Batteries"
  robot_fission_batteries_tech_desc:0 "Fission batteries are a pre-War portable power source, often found in robots and vehicles. Their way of generating electricity can be traced back to nuclear fission and acid-based electrochemical reactions, their exact inner workings to this day, are unknown. Attaching larger-sized batteries to our robots, salvaged from street- and industrial lamps will certainly improve their overall performance."
  robot_armour_hardening_tech:0 "Armour Hardening"
  robot_armour_hardening_tech_desc:0 "Most commercially used robots were designed to be as light as possible, so their driving system can move them more easily, and through that, for a longer time. While the concept is noble, it isn't suited for our way of utilizing said units - we'll have to reinforce their thin and shiny aluminium composite with industrial-grade metal alloys."
  robot_high_power_optics_tech:0 "High Power Optics"
  robot_high_power_optics_tech_desc:0 "The regular optics used in robots at the most are designed to concentrate just enough light to perform their original task. While it is hardly enough for self-defence, it is utterly lacking the capabilities of any military application. Luckily, there are more than enough industrial- and army-grade grade optics to refit our mechanical soldiers."
  robot_advanced_power_systems_tech:0 "Advanced Power Systems"
  robot_advanced_power_systems_tech_desc:0 "The main problem with the usual mechanical ally is that they're either bound to a local power source or have to operate through a rechargeable battery - neither of them very effective nor convenient. While replacing said technologies is out of bounds for us, we easily could replace our fission battery-based system with a fusion core one."
  robot_handy_tech:0 "Mr Handy"
  robot_handy_tech_desc:0 "While those pre-war housekeepers can be found in many robotics factory in the wasteland, they might have a tad more firepower than required for most children birthday party. With bolt-on armour added to reinforce the civilian-grade shell, the removal of the flamethrower and it's replacement by a laser pistol, it becomes an effective combat unit that we can more easily field."
  robot_handy_equipment_tech_1:0 "Mr Handy"
  robot_gutsy_tech:0 "Mr Gutsy"
  robot_gutsy_tech_desc:0 "A pre-war and more advanced variant of the Mr Handy manufactured expressly for combat can upgrade our robot divisions while reducing cost by taking the basis of it's householding sibling. And even though we cannot at our current level manufacture the original armour and weaponry specified in the blueprints, we can still manage to provide them with face-hardened steel to resist anti-tank rifles as well as overcharged automatic laser weaponry."
  robot_handy_equipment_tech_2:0 "Mr Gutsy"
  robot_handy_equipment_tech_3:0 "Mr Blasto"
  robot_handy_equipment_tech_4:0 "Mr Blasto Mk2"
  robot_gutsy_hardening_tech:0 "Armour Hardening"
  robot_gutsy_hardening_tech_desc:0 "Revising the armour scheme of our combat units can vastly increase their effectiveness while under small arms fire. Full-on welding as well as cast pieces with less breaking points such as joints or rivets will let our robots withstand heavy firepower in the line of duty, protecting our soldiers more effectively."
  robot_fuel_refinement_tech:0 "Fuel Refinement"
  robot_fuel_refinement_tech_desc:0 "While previous fuels used to supply our robotic divisions were decent, their provenance as well as composition was doubtful to say the least. A unified manufacturing method as well as better chemical composition will leave much less depot in the fuel filters and reduce the need for maintenance."
  robot_flamethrower_tech:0 "Flamethrower addon"
  robot_flamethrower_tech_desc:0 "The study of many removed flamethrower units provided our engineers with a better understanding of their main components, and even though it was prohibitive to arm our robots with such devices before, we can now upgrade them again with a better ones sporting a pressurized armored fuel cannister, and more harmful fuel composition designed around both direct damage and toxic byproducts."
  robot_antigrav_tech:0 "Antigrav Engines"
  robot_antigrav_tech_desc:0 "Replacing chemical propulsion by an antigrav engine will let our support divisions move on the battlefield without constant readjustements from their counter-thrusters, thus ensuring higher speed. The lack of complex inter-linked sensors and thrusters, all switched for a single anti-gravity drive, ensure this is done at no additional cost."
  robot_command_equipment_tech_1:0 "CnC-Bot"
  robot_command_equipment_tech_1_desc:0 "Originally designed as a mobile media transmitter, eyebots were often re-equipped with weaponry to act as listening post, scout units or law enforcement. The eyeball shaped shell, as well as a mounting point allowing us to arm them with sufficient firepower for their off frontline duty."
  robot_eyebot_tech:0 "Eyebot"
  robot_eyebot_tech_desc:0 "Originally designed as a mobile media transmitter, eyebots were often re-equipped with weaponry to act as listening post, scout units and law enforcement. The duraframe shaped shell as well as a mounting point allowing us to arm them with cut-down laser submachine guns make them the most advanced light robot we can field."
  robot_command_equipment_tech_3:0 "Robobrain"
  robot_command_equipment_tech_3_desc:0 "A tracked chassis on a two-piece welded reinforced frame composed of thick hardened composite platings as well as dexterous robotic arms using the best servos available and integrated flexible laser cannons form the basis for our Robobrain design. The final touch is a completely sterile and thick bulletproof dome containing either the mind-wiped brain of small animals, the brain of executed criminal, or those of particularly willing soldiers wanting to become death machines, which makes these robots able to react to threats on the fly and be as efficient, if not more, than footsoldiers. This has also resulted in breakthroughs in life-extension technologies, at the price of some humanity."
  robot_protectron_tech_1:0 "Commercial Protectron"
  robot_protectron_tech_1_desc:0 "Often called \"trashcans on legs\" for their cumbersome appearance and top-heavy design, civilian protectrons can still make useful shields for our main troops. Replacing the frail shell by a more sturdy armour steel one and supplying their recently added arm-mounted laser machine pistols with overcharged ammunition maximizes their potential in this role."
  robot_protectron_equipment_tech_1:0 "Commercial Protectron"
  robot_protectron_tech_2:0 "Security Protectron"
  robot_protectron_tech_2_desc:0 "Security Protectrons, or Mark 2 Protectrons, are a line of more advanced robots manufactured by Robco for light police duty. While \"advanced\" is a relative term when it comes to them, the addition of better housing for their arm-mounted laser weaponry, as well as switching their old laser pistols for cut-down laser sub-machinegun makes them fearsome opponents. The final touch is a series of bolted-on reinforced plating to supplement the bullet-proof shell."
  robot_protectron_equipment_tech_2:0 "Security Protectron"
  robot_alloy_tech:0 "Specialized Alloys"
  robot_alloy_tech_desc:0 "Our robots cannot mount as much weight as our vehicles, so we cannot armour them with the same alloy as effectively. A specialized material made to privilege weight savings and easy manufacturing over protection should reduce the strain on the servos, and allow us thicker and better shaped plating covering flaws in their armouring scheme."
  robot_precision_motor_tech:0 "Precision Motors"
  robot_precision_motor_tech_desc:0 "Previous servos were clunky remains of cost-cutting by pre-war companies. Better internal assembly with improved internal gearing will make our robots able to react more precisely and efficiently to incoming threats. This also has the unintended side effect of improving their close-combat performances, to the point some have been seen simply crushing PA helmets to kill their operator."
  robot_assaultron_tech:0 "Assaultron"
  robot_assaultron_tech_desc:0 "A medium robot designed for frontline combat and CQC operations, it's agility and advanced internal processor let it swiftly move through the battlefield while scanning and dispatching threats with it's focused laser beam and close-quarter claws."
  robot_assaultron_equipment_tech_1:0 "Assaultron"
  robot_assaultron_equipment_tech_2:0 "Assaultron Mk2"
  robot_lifter_equipment_tech:0 "Heavy Lifter Bot"
  robot_lifter_equipment_tech_desc:0 "Intended for logistical duties, this heavy robot can be converted into a fearsome frontline fighter. Our engineers are already working on a multitude of refits, such as bolting alloy platings to weak spots not covered by the already thick industrial plating, and replacing the lifting claws by protected weapon mounts. The space available once precision servos are scrapped let us arm these robots with a mix of light ordinance launchers and full-length laser machineguns."
  robot_cooling_systems_tech:0 "Cooling Systems"
  robot_cooling_systems_tech_desc:0 "The primary flaw with laser weaponry is the intense heat it emanates during firing procedure. By removing useless internal components around our robot's weapon mount, and installing a cooling jacket filled with oil, we can let our war machines fire much longer bursts and stay in the fight for hours before needing lense replacements."
  robot_sentrybot_tech_1:0 "Sentry Bot"
  robot_sentrybot_tech_1_desc:0 "A mountain of armour on a multi-directional tri-wheeled propulsion system results in the Sentry Bot Mark 1. The basic military design leaves little to be changed, with the only modifications being replacing the pre-war rocket launcher and gatling laser by our own manufactured variants."
  robot_cooling_systems_tech_2:0 "Advanced Cooling System"
  robot_cooling_systems_tech_2_desc:0 "More processing power and bigger internal reactors require more and more cooling to remain effective in the scorching desert heat of the wasteland. Specialized high-speed fan, and a coolant network akin to those found in pre-war supercomputers, will let our machine operate at peak efficiency."
  robot_sentrybot_tech_2:0 "Sentry Bot Mk2"
  robot_sentrybot_tech_2_desc:0 "Lessons learned through training exercises and actual combat can all be applied to the Sentrybot Mark 2, a pre-world wonder of heavy robotics suited to any frontline task. While we could simply manufacture them based on the original blueprints, we need to be smarter. Boasting a choice of multiple weaponry, this version is armed with two high-powered laser chainguns, privileging a focus toward annihilating soft target while the high cyclic rate combined with the nuclear generator core can still melt through light enemy armour in seconds."
  robot_military_hardware_tech:0 "Military Hardware"
  robot_military_hardware_tech_desc:0 "Replacing scavenged processing boards with re-manufactured military-grade components is a difficult task, but one which is more than worth pursuing. Improved sub-systems can drastically increase the effectiveness of our robots through advanced processing capabilities, better servos coupling, and increased internal power reserve to direct to propulsion or weapons."
  robot_impact_resistant_chassi_tech:0 "Impact Resistant Chassis"
  robot_impact_resistant_chassi_tech_desc:0 "Made to withstand anything from melee combat to even anti-tank fire in some cases, our robotical units still suffer from some problems. While in battle, the internal components risk to rattle inside the armored shell, damaging sensitive equipment. An internal soft layer of kevlar and kinetic foam around sub-systems provide dampeners, resolving this issue."
  robot_organic_processor_tech:0 "Organic Processors"
  robot_organic_processor_tech_desc:0 "Even though such measures are unethical, to put it very mildly, research can be made into using the most efficient computer of all as a central processor for our robots. The human brain. Providing a safe and sterile environment for our \"organic processors\" is a crucial step for any field deployment, and the lessons learned from brain structure studies can improve our more standard processing boards."
  robot_securitron_tech_1:0 "Securitron"
  robot_securitron_tech_1_desc:0 "A private security robot manufactured for police duty in difficult areas of operation, the monowheel propulsion system and fully welded titanium alloy shell provides both good mobility and armour against typical small arms found on patrols, such as shotguns, revolvers and hunting rifles. Meanwhile, an arm mounted 9mm sub-machinegun and X-25 gatling laser pistol allows the Securitron unit to handle any close-combat scenario."
  robot_scurry_tech:0 "Scurry Salvager Bot"
  robot_scurry_tech_desc:0 "Small robots designed for underground ambush and close-quarter combat, those mechanical spiders are equipped with sharp arachnic legs and seismic sensors to detect surface target while on the prowl. The horrific manner in which they dispatch threats as well as the way their salvaging claws can make them burrow into lightly armored enemy vehicles leaves little doubt as to their effectiveness."
  robot_humanoid_tech:0 "C27 Humanoid Robot"
  robot_humanoid_tech_desc:0 "Bipedal robots designed before the great war to pacify the nuclear wasteland of thereafter, those units sports a sophisticated sensor network to easily identify any target via a spectrum of detection range from thermic to wavelength. Designed to use normal infantry or PA equipment, they are still armored with advanced composite plating, and post-war engineering added a layer of EMP shielding and flexible armoring over joints. Armed with heavy weaponry such as laser miniguns, gauss pistols and plasma rifles, they are a force to be reckoned with."
  robot_pacification_bot_tech:0 "Super-Heavy Quadrupeds"
  robot_pacification_bot_tech_desc:0 "A large quadrupedal robot reminescent of large animals of old, this war machine originally boasted tank-like protection and four pacification cannons. Further thinkinering done by the Calculator has replaced the four cannons by two rotary laser autocannons, and attention was given to enhanced mobility systems and better tactical link with other robotical units, making them mobile command posts."
  robot_behemoth_robot_tech:0 "Super-Heavy Colossals"
  robot_behemoth_robot_tech_desc:0 "A gargantuan beast of a machine, calling this robot a walking tank would be a disservice to the sheer bulk in weaponry and armour it carries. Originally armed with four fast-firing .50 cal machineguns, those were replaced for a quadruple 20mm autocannon arrangement. Combined with armour thick enough to stop plasma projectiles or even naval artillery, there is nothing our enemy can do but gasp before being shred to pieces."
  securitron_grenade_software_tech:0 "Rapid-Fire G-28 Grenade Launching System"
