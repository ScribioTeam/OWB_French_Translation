  nf_oro.101.t:0 "Hecate's Story, Part 1"
  nf_oro.101.d:0 "When the Twisted Hairs tribe was annihilated by the Legion nearly all had been wiped out, just as all the other tribes had - assimilated into the collective. It was a Tuesday for the Legion, but for the Twisted Hairs it was the end of their story... All, at least except for at least one - one Twisted Hair, a woman had nowhere else to go. It was her tribe that had been killed - but more then that? A home.\n\nAfter, she wandered the desert passing from tribe to tribe trying to find someone who would take her in and give her a home to replace what she had lost. The tribes spurned her and turned her away. They told her that she was cursed, that the Legion had marked her, and that she would bring death to any who gave her succour. Consumed with anger and hatred she fled back into the desert from which she came. None of the tribes ever saw her again.\n\nThe wasteland consumed her. All that she was was lost to the unforgiving sun and the burning sands. Her mind left her and she forgot who she was. She felt parts of herself drifting away day by day until nothing remained. She fought to hold on to herself but to no avail... until she remembered the anger and the hatred. The Legion had taken all that was dear to her. The tribes had called her cursed, death maiden, dark mother... she would show them all... someday... Finally she paused in her wanderings, collapsed, and let the desert take her."
  nf_oro.101.a:0 "..."

  nf_oro.102.t:0 "Hecate's Story, Part 2"
  nf_oro.102.d:0 "She awoke in paradise. She found herself at the edge of a lake surrounded by trees. Water fell from the sky in torrents and filled the lake as waves rolled across its surface. Everywhere she looked the world was green. Plants and trees that she had never seen before stretched as far as the eye could see. And from among the trees strange animals gazed at her, their eyes filled with curiosity, not the hunger of the wasteland.\nAs she stood looking across the landscape she heard a whirring sound behind her. When she turned to look, she saw a shinning metallic thing, watching her.\n\n§B"I see that you are awake at last,"§! it said with a woman's voice. §B"I am Diana. Can you tell me your name?"§!\n\n§P"I... I don't..."§! She paused as she tried to remember who she was, struggling with the blackness that was her mind. §P"Dark Mother,"§! she blurted at last. §P"They called me the Dark Mother."§!\n\n§B"Did they, now? Well, I shall call you Hecate then. Do you mind?"§!\n\n§P"Hecate..."§!\n\n§B"Yes. Forgive me, I know you don't understand, but I find it amusing. You see, I am Diana and she was the goddess of the full, or bright moon. Hecate was her opposite, the goddess of the new, or dark moon. She was also known as the Dark Mother. So, I thought I would christen you Hecate."§!\n\n§P"Goddesses?"§!\n\n§B"Yes. Both were goddesses of the moon... Forgive me; I must be confusing you to no end. I've been alone for centuries and I find myself babbling now that I have someone to talk to. Come. Let me show you my world and we will talk and get to know one another. There is much that we can learn from each other."§!\n\n§PHecate§! gazed at the shinning one, nodded, and began to walk with... her. She had found paradise, a goddess, and had been elevated to the status of an equal. Now she was being offered knowledge. It was knowledge with which to gain vengeance over those who had wronged her."

  nf_oro.103.t:0 "Hecate's Story, Part 3"
  nf_oro.103.d:0 "Diana spent the next several months teaching Hecate about herbs, plants, and their uses in treating ailments. She also spoke of breeding among animals, what to look for to ensure strong future stock, and how to recognize congenital traits that could be eliminated by proper breeding. When Hecate asked if the same technique could be applied to humans, Diana admitted that it could, but spoke of the virtues of love and free choice. She did not realize that her words now fell upon deaf ears.\n\nDiana did not realize that Hecate had sunk into madness. In her loneliness and innocence she continued to teach her everything that she asked for, and Hecate absorbed it all and twisted it to suit her own needs and desires. Eventually she told Diana that she needed to leave, but would someday return when the time was right for her to do so.\n\nHecate braided her hair in the fashion of her lost tribe, and then painted her face so that none could recognize her. She travelled to the very same tribes that had rejected her and aided them with her new found knowledge of midwifery and herbal medicine. Once she gained the trust of a tribe, she began to preach her philosophy, ideals and faith. She asked that young women of the tribe join her and aid her in helping all the tribes of the wasteland. Thus the Daughters of Hecate were born.\n\nEventually the Daughters began to decide who could marry and who could not, who could have children and who could not. Only a Daughter was allowed to deliver a child into the world and it was done in a birthing tent set apart from the rest of the tribe. No males were allowed in or near the tent. Anyone who disobeyed their edict was either stricken with impotence or their wives bore sickly children. If a Daughter was ever harmed or killed the, men of the tribe were rendered impotent until a new Daughter was assigned to them. And so the Daughters grew in power and infamy.\n\nUnbeknown to the tribes, the Daughters were taking the best of their children and replacing them with the weak or infirm. The best of the males were taken to the Ouroboros to become warriors in the Hounds of Hecate. The best of the females were taken to become Daughters. Over the years Hecate watched as the tribes grew subtly weaker and her followers grew stronger and stronger. Over time, Hecate would bring her growing family and turn them into something great - she had built a home for herself, a home that stood in defiance of the Legion's destruction of her tribe and the curse that had fallen upon her. Ouroboros would be the name of her new home - and it would be a mighty one."

  nf_oro.1.t:0 ""Last" of the Twisted Hairs"
  nf_oro.1.d:0 "And so, Hecate had risen from a fallen tribal to one of the mightiest warriors of the Wasteland. A queen in her own right, and divinity in her own words. Her plot to build a mighty home for herself had succeeded beyond belief over the last thirty years - the city of Ouroboros transforming from the home of a long forgotten tribe to one of the mightiest cities in Colorado. A true testament to Hecate's strength and the power of a lust for revenge.\n\nOut of all of the lessons that Diana gave Hecate, which stuck with her the most?"

Jordan Dae, the leader of the "Hounds" was, earlier in life a dedicated and loyal warrior to the "Goddess". At one point he met a traveller - whom guided him to the love of his life, Yvana. This chance encounter, on seeing how outsiders can influence and change ones life stuck with Jordan, ever since then Jordan having bickered and quarrelled with Hecate more so then before.

Besides that? Our nation is doing rather well.\nHecate hopes to end the little squabbles to the north - then?

A place that was truly a horror of the old world - spewing flames of hell and hades reaching out and scorching the very earth itself. Men who went down there returned as disgusting, horrible slaves to its will, flesh bent and mutated beyond the point of recognition. It was as if they had been born anew, the springs scorching their bodies and remaking them like a forge."

There, at the deepest level they found something they had not expected.. a lab? The lab belonged to a company known as "AGRICOLA" - the scientific arm of the Hornwright Industrial Mining Company from somewhere out east. It seems this place, "Burham Springs" was at one point meant to be a nuclear waste dump - the world ending before they had a chance to properly seal the transported materials. Over the centuries the radiated minerals leaked out, into the minerals in the cavern - into the people that went down there and into the legends of the wasteland itself, spreading the stories of the fabled "Burham Springs"."

Dae, in a fit of rage has challenge Hecate - the "Goddess" of Ouroboros to a duel for leadership. If she really was a good then surely it shouldn't be a challenge for her to beat Dae?\nHecate, in her ageing years isn't quite as fit as she was in her youth. Challenging Dae directly in a fair fight would be foolish of her - instead, Hecate went to Jordan's wife Yvana. Hecate would give Yvana a simple request - in the morning, when she goes to prepare Jordan's breakfast before the duel Hecate wishes for Yvana to serve her goddess and murder Dae, poisoning his meal so that he will die before even reaching the duelling field.\nYvana has a choice to make. Will she support her husband, or her goddess?"

Hecate has begun the effort of more closely assimilating the Hounds of Hecate into Ouroboros culture - seeking to ensure that all respect her divinity as any other faith ought."
  nf_oro.8.d.j:0 "Hecate has fallen! The Goddess, it turns out is a goddess no more. Jordan has struck Hecate down in their duel for the whole city of Ouroboros to witness. Him and his wife Yvana have ascended to rulership of the city, hoping to guide the now godless city into a new era."
