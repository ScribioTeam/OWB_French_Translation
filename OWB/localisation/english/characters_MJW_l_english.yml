  MJW_ULYSSES_DESC:0 "Having been spared many of the horrors of the new world, some would call Moose Jaw a paradise while others would label it weak willed. It has been afforded a degree of separation from the recent conflicts of the region thanks to good relations with their neighbors. The relatively pacifistic Elbo acts as a buffer between Moose Jaw and the Raider Electorate to the north and trade is secured in the south by the ever timely and reliable Mad Trains. Only the Metis revolt has shattered the peace that they’d grown accustomed to. Seeing the horrors of such a conflict first hand has only resolved their commitment to peace and good will however."
