  nf_80s.111.d:0 "The northernmost stretch of I-80 lays in the hands of Vault City. They have been amicable to us in the past, maybe it's time we request control of our rightful lands?"
  nf_80s.111.a:0 "Offer to defend them in exchange for the land."

  nf_80s.1.d:0 "The Eighties fled east after [NCR.GetDef]'s assaults on their base. At long last, they found a home near a pre-war town called Wendover. After conquering the small town, the Eighties had to decide. Would they prepare to drive west, to reclaim their homeland? Or would they start a new life in Utah and Nevada?"
  nf_80s.1.a:0 "We were born to ride."

  nf_80s.2.d:0 "Our leader and ruler shall give us victory, for he is the Thunderbird, greatest of the Road Warriors, master of the great V-8, prophet of the great road, and rightful warchief of the Eighties! To us, his people, he has promised a future, a redemption for the failures of the past. Let us ride to meet destiny, for in his visions the bear knows fear, the bull knows caution, and the Road Warriors ride free once more."

  nf_80s.3.t:0 "The Nevada Road War"
  nf_80s.3.d:0 "The NCR found a foe unlike any other they had faced before, for while they had fought gangs and tribals, they had never before been challenged by true road warriors. Even as they drove us from our homeland, we ravaged their allies during the great exodus through Nevada. A hundredfold are the tales of respect and fear told by those who were our foes, and a hundredfold more are our own tales of greatness and daring, the legends of the Nevada Road War. For now I shall tell you the story of the time the Eighties..."
  nf_80s.3.a:0 "Stole scientists from Vault City."
  nf_80s.3.b:0 "Kidnapped mechanics from New Reno's chop shops."
  nf_80s.3.c:0 "Picked up raider buddies along the way."
  #########################
  nf_80s.4.t:0 "The Utah Road War"
  nf_80s.4.d:0 "Wounded, limping, our nation lying in shamble. The dishonourable NCR destroyed us at Sac city, they came with guns, explosives, flame and steel. They killed our greatest warriors and our most honourable citizens. Our elders and our children. Our past and our future. They forced us to flee but we still survived and thrived, and when the time is right, we shall come back to Sac City. The bear think it can drive us to extinction, but again and again we have proven our worth. Our legacy shall not perish, we shall fight for our rightful future, and we will return as heroes, delivering our homeland once again! Until then, let our wrath shake the very core of our neighbours."

  nf_80s.5.d:0 "The Grabbers put up a valiant fight, but they could not stop the Eighties. Crushed beneath our Road Warriors, their leader is our prisoner. But the Grabbers are free spirits who hate the NCR and all its works, just like us. Webster Adam, their leader, would swear fealty to our case. On the other hand, some Grabbers would gladly work for us if we just give them the peaceful use of our roads. Not everyone can be a Road Warrior, after all."

They fled to the Ruby Valley, but with our conquest, they've learned they could run, but they can't ride. \n\nTwo of our drivers distinguished themselves. Furiosa was able to hold a position against enormous odds, while Major Kalashnikov kept men driving through the night to strike exposed positions. Which one shall we honour?"

  nf_80s.7.d:0 "Conquering Hammond, was not easy, but two of our Elders provided great advice. Windwaker taught us to drive through old abandoned roads, while Stonefoot taught us the advantage of... marching! Both of them offer advice for running our new lands. Windwaker has proposed a new system of tribute, while Stonefoot has suggested using the people of Eastport as our slaves."

  nf_80s.8.d:0 "The fall of Eastport has encouraged greater thoughts from our people. Big Bear has cobbled together a system to convert corn and grain into more fuel for our cars, while Davison has developed a way to mount more weapons on our hot rods.

  #########################
