    HAN_Kennelmaster:0 "Kennelmaster Jamison"
    HAN_Kennelmaster_desc:0 "Even with the massive sprawl surrounding Dog City, there will always be a need for more buildings."
    HAN_medicine:0 "Maria Greene"
    HAN_medicine_desc:0 "The outbreak of New Plague and many industrial troubles left a surprising trove of medical supplies in Denver. While food was short before and after the war, cure alls and vaccines were in high supply. Nearly 200 years later, the reduced population and glut of medical literature has left Hangdog territory one of the healthiest places in the wastes."
    HAN_foreman:0 "Foreman Cox"
    HAN_foreman_desc:0 "\"Charges are set, we should get this rubble cleared in the hour.\""
    HAN_touchdown:0 "Touchdown"
    HAN_touchdown_desc:0 "Descending from a family that practically ran a raider empire decades ago, they got into a safer form of extortion. Owning many of the industrial jobs and tenants on the lower levels of Dog City, Touchdown watchs the caps flow in and greases the wheels where she can."
    HAN_mobius:0 "Mobius Type Economic Evaluator"
    HAN_mobius_desc:0 "An experimental computing system created to adequately distribute food in the last days of the Resource Wars. Once thought to be blunt and full of useless features, proper usage can provide guidance on allocating resources."
    HAN_henson:0 "Bryce Henson"
    HAN_henson_desc:0 "Some of the outliers of the Hangdogs tend to take their reverence of animals too far. Some of them establish totems or other strange habits, but Henson perhaps takes the cake. Eating only kibble and some of the scraps he feeds his war hounds, he claims that he is no better than the beasts he fights with. Disgusting to say the least, but his warband has never gone hungry."
    HAN_booth:0 "Chadwick Booth"
    HAN_booth_desc:0 "\"When we stopped the raids, we lost our edge. The Hangdogs used to be the bane of Colorado. The ghouls of the North and the fake hounds to the south should be quivering in fear. Show me you haven't lost your bite.\""
    HAN_rex:0 "Rex"
    HAN_caravan:0 "Caravan Master Byrne"
    HAN_caravan_desc:0 "Trade is life in the wasteland. While many of the Brahmin barons and water merchants of the west just wish to live life as fat as possible, Byrne sees it as a stepping stone. Controlling the flow of resources, news, and travel in and out of an area, the Wasteland is just an impressive chessgame for him."
    HAN_munch:0 "Computechtron Alphanumeric Number Cruncher"
    HAN_munch_desc:0 "Originally meant as a processing system for mapping the Human Genome, Computechtron's greatest achievement now works to piece together the secrets of prewar science."

    HAN_network:0 "Allied Technology Learning Network"
    HAN_network_lar:0 "Allied Technology Learning Network"
    HAN_howler:0 "Howler"
    HAN_howler_desc:0 "Most of the tribal and raider elements of the Hangdogs have been purged, but some remains around the edges. Owning a security company outside of Dog City, Howler refuses a traditional name. The nickname his gang gave him years ago is worth more than anything conforming could give him."
    HAN_powergrid:0 "GDA Fusion Power Grid "
    HAN_powergrid_desc:0 "Towering over the plains, without proper context the wind turbines look like strange idols to some long forgotten culture. With proper oversight however, the blades can turn on and the power will flow through the wastes."
    HAN_plains:0 "Plainswalker Adonai"
    HAN_plains_desc:0 "Colorado wasn't known for its infrastructure before the war, but little is left after the bombs dropped. Crossing great distances to scavenge for food and resources, the Plainswalkers are one of the last tribes to not be fully integrated into the Hangdogs. Led by Adonai, they heed the will of [HAN.GetLeader] to rule the plains of Colorado. "

    HAN_grand_advisor:0 "Tributary Watcher"
    HAN_grand_advisor_desc:0 "The Arkansas Tributary serves as a natural border into Hangdogs territory. With the trade brought along its rivers, the food it provides, and protection from the horrors to the south, some consider it to be a holy land. Patrolling across the tributary, they view themselves as defenders of nature's gift to the Hangdogs."
    HAN_BENRY:0 "Border Protection Unit BENRY"
    HAN_BENRY_desc:0 "\"Please present your passport for inspection.\" "
