  ## Focuses
  ncr_nf:0 "The NCR's Rise and Fall: A Focus Tree"
  ncr_founding_myth:0 "A Founding Myth"
  ncr_founding_myth_desc:0 "When Vault 15 opened in 2097, its dwellers emerged to a changed world. Equipped as they were with a GECK, they set about founding Shady Sands, a fledging settlement soon to become a beacon in the wasteland. Life wasn't easy, however."
  ncr_tandis_legacy:0 "President Tandi's Legacy"
  ncr_tandis_legacy_desc:0 "While President Aradesh was instrumental in the foundation of this fair Republic, President Tandi was without doubt one of the most consequential figures in the post-War wasteland. Under her wise guidance Shady Sands grew to new heights and the Republic boomed in power and influence. Her thinking forever shaped the future of the NCR and the wasteland."
  ncr_time_erodes_beauty:0 "Time Erodes All Beauty"
  ncr_time_erodes_beauty_desc:0 "Under Tandi, the Republic flourished. Under Tibbett, it stagnated. When Peterson took over the reigns, the Republic began to creak under pressure..."
  ncr_early_sotu:0 "The State of the Union"
  ncr_early_sotu_desc:0 "The NCR has faced many crises throughout the decades, but has always managed to weather most things thrown at relatively intact. The Republic is not as strong as it once was, however, and is relying ever more on aggressive military responses to most thorny issues."
  ncr_democracy_and_despotism:0 "Democracy and Despotism"
  ncr_democracy_and_despotism_desc:0 "Democracy in California has remained relatively stable since the conception of the Republic, but the NCR's democratic system is far from safe. Dirty money now clogs the mechanisms of government, and the lack of direct elections for President sap the NCR's legitimacy. While democracy would survive most challenges at the moment, the 2278 election still promises to be a pivotal moment for the NCR's future."
  # Navarro Crisis Foci
  ncr_navarro_crisis:0 "Send Emergency Aid to Navarro"
  ncr_navarro_crisis_desc:0 "The fragile balance of power in the Navarro Territories has broken down completely, sparking a rapid escalation of hostilities between Shi Settlers, Brahmin-backed Farmers and the Tribals caught in the cross-fire. We need to send emergency aid to the NCR settlers caught in the conflict to prevent a humanitarian crisis."
  # Hub Violence Foci
  ncr_deploy_troopers_to_hub:0 "Deploy Federal Troopers to the Hub"
  ncr_deploy_troopers_to_hub_desc:0 "We've only ever enjoyed a loose grip of our southern trade cities, and the dominance of local trade groups has become blatantly obvious as violence has erupted between hostile smuggling gangs in the Hub. If we don't intervene soon, we risk a bloodbath."
  ncr_public_library:0 "The Public Library"
  ncr_public_library_desc:0 "For some reason, a lot of the Wasteland thinks the NCR is an anarchic land overrun by slaving raiders. But the Hub's had a library since 2137! And now we can expand it further."
  ncr_raid_gang_hqs:0 "Authorise Raids on Gang Headquarters"
  ncr_raid_gang_hqs_desc:0 "Federal Troopers on the streets of the Hub may have been able to quell some of the more violent gang clashes, but while the leadership of each gang remains operational we won't be able to properly quench the conflict. Let's eliminate them."
  ncr_cultivate_national_guard:0 "Cultivate the National Guard"
  ncr_cultivate_national_guard_desc:0 "Federal Troopers can't be responsible for keeping the peace in the Hub forever. We should build up a local National Guard capable of breaking up violence in our place."

  ncr_hub_redevelopment_act_desc:0 "The Hub has been battered by conflicts between Federal Forces, rival gangs and local militias. Now the violence is mostly quenched, it's time to start rebuilding some of the most damaged areas."
  ncr_permanent_hub_advisors:0 "Recruit Local Minds"
  ncr_permanent_hub_advisors_desc:0 "Violence in the Hub, and the Federal Government's involvement therein, cost many lives and damaged many homes. It wasn't all terrible news, however: martial law exposed senior military and political officials to a number of sympathetic local figures who's skills could greatly help the Republic. Let's bring them on board."

  ncr_rural_revitalisation_act_desc:0 "Decades of war, raider attacks, conscription and drought have left vast swaths of the our rural territories extremely disadvantaged. We must fix this if we are to start any sort of economic recovery."
  ncr_tackle_consumerism:0 "Begin to Tackle Rampant Consumerism"
  ncr_tackle_consumerism_desc:0 "The Republic's people are plagued by the scourge of rampant consumerism reminiscent of the last gasps of Old American Capitalism. It may have been sustainable in the Old World, but if we aren't able to tackle the vast expenditure of much-needed resources on fast fashion and consumer goods we may very well end up like Old America..."

  ncr_dep_of_railroads_desc:0 "While the rest of the Wateland relies on salvage, the Republic, unique among the Wasteland, can build a railway. Power armour is fine and all, but can it ship thirty thousand men in a few hours?"

  ncr_urban_industry_hubs:0 "Develop Urban Industry Hubs"
  ncr_urban_industry_hubs_desc:0 "While our rural areas need drastic help to ensure they'll thrive far into the future, we also need to make sure our urban areas keep pace."

  ncr_military_complex:0 "Reinvigorate the Military Complex"

  ncr_open_door:0 "The Open Door Policy"
  ncr_open_door_desc:0 "Whatever our disagreements with Vault City's, it's the outpost of the civilized world against the East. Let us work to promote ties, and perhaps encourage them to be more tolerant."
  ncr_light_them_up:0 "Light Them Up"
  ncr_light_them_up_desc:0 "The NCR is in the Mojave to brighten the world. And also the Republic. Why not take some time to make that happen?"
  ncr_epa:0 "A Better World"

  ncr_redeploy_rangers_to_ranches_desc:0 "Following an attack on the Flynn Family Ranch by raider gangs, the Brahmin Barons have demanded the deployment of a number of our elite Ranger divisions to protect their precious livestock. We're pretty powerless to refuse such a demand, as the NCR is almost exclusively dependent on their ranches to supply its populace with food."

  ncr_mojave_affair:0 "The Mojave Affair"
  ncr_mojave_affair_desc:0 "Conflict in the Mojave has long been a drain on the Republic's manpower and equipment. The land between the Long 15 and New Vegas is largely useless, but plagued by raiders and Legionary scouts.We'll need to help out our expedition to the region if they are to successfully pacify the area: but how much are we willing to commit?"

  ncr_bolster_mojave_deps_desc:0 "The Mojave Campaign is, and always has been, severely under-funded and under-staffed. Sadly, we're in no position to redeploy forces from our other fronts at the moment, but we might be able to spare a sliver of our untrained reserve..."
  ncr_send_direct_aid:0 "Send Direct Aid to the Campaign"
  ncr_send_direct_aid_desc:0 "Sending untrained personnel and funds to equip them is far from sufficient to properly defend the Mojave. We'll need to send men and equipment if we are to stand any chance of successfully annexing the Mojave in good time."
  ncr_research_for_expeditions:0 "Expeditionary Research"
  ncr_research_for_expeditions_desc:0 "If we are to be able to win victories in California's many frontier regions, we must be prepared to share our cutting-edge technological progress with our local commanders. What better way to do it than under the Aradesh Programme!"

  ncr_bull_in_power_plant_desc:0 "Despite all the manpower and equipment we supplied to prop up the Mojave Expedition, none could prepare for the onslaught the Legion unleashed at the Battle of Hoover Dam. Now, our sworn enemies hold a much-needed bastion of the Old World. We must return it to our control."
  ncr_lost_not_forgotten:0 "Lost, But Not Forgotten"
  ncr_lost_not_forgotten_desc:0 "The Mojave Territories may have collapsed, but our dreams of New Vegas' lights are far from quenched. We should begin plotting anew to march into the Mojave - this time with the full force of the NCR behind any such move."

Barons of the north, Followers from the south, Ghouls of Boneyard, Elites of Shady Sands. All desperately clinging to their petty identities. Not anymore. We created a republic where a farmer from Dayglow can sell their crops to a citizen from Redding, where a citizen can toil alongside many in our war effort against petty tyrants, where ghouls and super mutants could live without fearing for their lives. \n\n Every day, more and more citizens identify themselves as NCR citizens, taking pride in the fact that they are a part of a nation greater than themselves. People began to voluntarily conscript for the army or work night shifts to produce the equipment needed for the army. The sacrifices of our citizens to protect our Republic shows the world that whatever they throw at us, we stand together."

  ncr_cooperatives:0 "NCR Cooperatives"
  ncr_cooperatives_desc:0 "Even though the Republic has a lot of arable land, we are no strangers to food shortages or food scarcity, due to having no centralised policy on food planning. This was further exacerbated by our growing dependence on the Brahmin Barons for supplying the Republic with food. Wendell Peterson, being the ineffective president he is, watched idly while Barons bought out every single ranch, becoming a monopoly on the food trade. No longer able to compete with the Barons, only few of our citizens engage in farming and those who do only grow crops for themselves. While we can not change the mistakes of the past, we can learn from them. \n\n Organising people willing to work the land in a sharecropping system equipped with modern tractors and farming equipment, we can create competition for the Barons. Our main issue is not to build sharecropper farms, but to keep them afloat against the price dumping Barons. Many attempted sharecropping before, with little success. Many of our farmers flocked to the Baja and Mojave frontiers, away from the northern food barons as much as possible. With government intervention, we can keep this from happening once again. Subsidizing the farms for a few years and a promise to buy their goods from a fixed price will ensure these farms will stand afloat until we can let them compete on a truly open market. This may cost us greatly for a few years, but it will ensure no citizen will ever go to sleep hungry because some Baron wanted to earn more caps."

They own most of the domestic Brahmin inside the Republic and command over much of the Republic's meat and dairy supply. Despite grazing their brahmin over the Republic's pastures, Barons preferred to sell most of their product to the Den, Klamath and most importantly, Reno. Citing the sheer distance and the lack of adequate technology to carry meat and dairy to the south without spoiling, Barons are unwilling to supply Shady Sands, much less Dayglow. While this is easily something we can fix, our government simply did not care for the ordinary citizens of the Republic, until now. \n\n With the passing of the 'Pasture Preservation Act', we can close our pastures to the public, outlawing public grazing. With brahmin herds reaching thousands, Barons can not maintain their herds without going against our laws. Offering to buy their brahmin for a good price, we can redistribute these brahmin to our sharecropper farms all over the Republic, ending the Baron's influence once and for all."

Realizing the importance of educating the farmers about pests, growing techniques, fertilizers and crop rotation.  \n\n Realising the danger, Followers offered to teach our farmers how to effectively farm.

Still, trade relationship blossomed after the depletion of the Broken Hills mine supplying the city with the uranium needed for the Gecko power plant. Our offer to supply them with uranium made our traders rich, but left us empty handed on our desire to acquire advanced medical tech. Their staunch dedication to their independence, coupled with their insistence on paying with caps and caps only, made trading for the medical technology we desperately need in the southern front impossible. \n\n So in order to access the medical technology and bring Vault City to the fold, NCR Congress authorised extreme measures to be taken.

Having a better life than they already have. Giving their children a better life. \n\n From our humble beginnings as a small town, we turned shanty towns into sprawling metropolises. We turned dying deserts green. Many corners of the wastelands blossomed under our rule. And most importantly, we continued to reach new heights every single day. Some of our citizens remember living in a shanty. Some were born in brick houses. Some never had any running water until moving to the Republic. Some never had the chance to express their ideas.

In the wasteland, nobody had the capacity to build electronics from scratch. They salvaged parts, and created a mishmash of many other electronics. Hearing the news of freshly produced electronics, people stomped on each other in an attempt to buy a new radio made from Californian steel, rather than buying a man-made salvaged radio. Having freshly made electronics became a new trend, a status of wealth.

  ncr_murphy.1.d:0 "Caesar isn't the only leader to be raised by the Followers of the Apocalypse. Murphy was orphaned by one of the ceaseless wars with the Brotherhood, but the 'anarchists' of the Boneyard raised him to forgive those who trespassed against him. To Murphy, Civilization is not a plasma rifle or a cult of authority. It's not a robot emperor or a holographic woman. It's a land that knows freedom from want, and freedom from fear. \n\nAs Murphy said in his inauguration speech, 'We know the world tends towards destruction. But let us try to make a difference.'  Caesar would call Murphy a fool; but perhaps Bull will find out that compassion is stronger than he thinks."
  ncr_murphy.1.a:0 "Let's find new ways for an old world."

  ncr_murphy.2.t:0 "The Blades"
  ncr_murphy.2.d:0 "While much of the NCR struggles with crime, the Boneyard is one of the safer regions due to protection from the Blades. Founded after the Great War by a woman named Razor in a pre-war nightclub, the Blades protect the Boneyard and Hub as a mix of a people's militia and vigilante justice. Although some criticize their rough Wasteland notion of justice, none can deny they protect their homes. \n\nMurphy proposes to take this model nationwide, promoting a people's militia. The name?  The Bear Claws."

  ncr_follower_advisor:0 "Followers in Government"

  ncr_murphy.3.t:0 "Support from Shady Sands"
  ncr_murphy.3.d:0 "Since our founding we've stood as the northern wall of California, the gateway against the cannibals of the north. Now Murphy wishes to recognize and support our role, expanding trading ties between our two nations. This will lead to more profit for both of us, and confirms that the Republic is the West's last, best hope. Perhaps, in time, this will lead to closer relations between our peoples."
  ncr_murphy.3.a:0 "Do they still have that statue?"
  ncr_murphy.3.b:0 "Promises of friendship and equality won't fool us!"

  ncr_murphy.4.t:0 "The Northern Threat"
  ncr_murphy.4.d:0 "For reasons that remain unclear, [ARR.GetLeader] rejected our proposal. Perhaps the rumours that the Chosen One engaged in pornography in his breaks between slave raids were true? Regardless, this will only embolden the hawks in the Republic."

  ncr_murphy.5.t:0 "Corruption Crackdown!"
  ncr_murphy.5.d:0 "Although the Van Graffs hail from Redding, they've long been opponents of Shady Sands. Under Kimball, he overlooked their past misconduct. But delays continued; cost overruns increased. Now rumours swirl that the Van Graffs will sell energy weapons to the Legion! These false slanders encouraged [NCR.GetLeader] to bring charges against the Van Graffs! NCR Rangers have seized many of the Van Graffs' assets, and relations between the family and the Republic will only worsen. Perhaps the family's criticisms of the Republic were justified after all?"
  ncr-murphy.5.a:0 "Good news for the Bishops; bad news for the rule of law."


  ncr_murphy.6.t:0 "Better Living Aboveground"
  ncr_murphy.6.d:0 "Although [NCR.GetLeader] is a bit too... idealistic for our tastes, with his love of the lesser sort, none can deny that we have more in common with the NCR than literally any other city or people. To that end, Murphy has offered a detachment of 'volunteers' to augment our military, in return for industrial aid. How shall we respond?"
  ncr_murphy.6.a:0 "We can find a use for these fine men."
  ncr_murphy.6.b:0 "I think we've had quite enough time with NCR soldiers, thank you."

  ncr_murphy.7.t:0 "Industrial Aid"
  ncr_murphy.7.d:0 "[VLT.GetLeader] agreed to our pact. With Vault City's assistance, our economic development will only continue. This just goes to show that the Followers' ideals are the key to the Wasteland."

  ncr_early.1.t:0 "Vault 13's Hero"
  ncr_early.1.d:0 "When Shady Sands was but a budding settlement, plagued by raiders and locked in a bitter struggle for survival, it was visited by a denizen of Vault 13. Known only as the \"Vault Dweller\", he met with Aradesh, who shared their knowledge with him on his quest to replace Vault 13's faulty water chip. While the water chip from Vault 15 (Shady Sands' home vault) was piled too far under rock for the Vault Dweller to recover, Aradesh's kindness made the Vault Dweller feel indebted to the struggling community. When disaster struck Shady Sands and Khan raiders captured Aradesh's daughter Tandi, the Vault Dweller repaid his debt ten times over, freeing Tandi and driving the Khans from the California for decades. \n\nOur run-in with the Vault Dweller's kindness and honour was a founding moment for the Republic, as without his bold assault on the Khans and freeing of Tandi our fledgling nation would never have taken off from the ground. Over the centuries after his visit, the Vault Dweller's impact on Shady Sands would morph into the settlement's founding myth. Society would be forever morphed, but by what fundamental ideal?"

  ncr_early.2.t:0 "The Republic's Golden Years"
  ncr_early.2.d:0 "Over the 52 years President Tandi led the Republic, the union of five states went from strength to strength. By focusing the Republic's economy and workforce on infrastructure and agriculture, California enjoyed a thriving network of trade routes and Brahmin farms. The clearing of roads, rivers and railways paved the way for the rapid redeployment of the NCR's growing military, allowing the prompt response to threats across southern California and reaching north towards Redding. Backed by an abundance of renewable food thanks to GECK-created farmland and Brahmin herds, the population of settlements major and minor alike exploded, further ballooned by an influx of new settlers from across Northern California and beyond. Never afraid of using underhand tactics to achieve her goals, she bullied New Reno and Vault City into joining the Republic as autonomous territories, and ordered the assault on Navarro that would shatter the Enclave on the West Coast. \n\nIn premiership so abundant with successes and victories, Tandi's legacy has shaped every aspect of the NCR and the wider wasteland. One set of her policies saw success beyond comparison, and helped the founding Shady Sands State grow beyond comparison."

  ncr_early.3.t:0 "Stagnation at the Zenith"
  ncr_early.3.d:0 "Soon after President Tandi's passing in 2248, the New California Republic reached its zenith. Under Tandi, Shady Sands spread from the Pacific to Redding, from the Boneyard to the gates of the Mojave. Even the Golden Circle's towns fell beneath the Bear, as Vault City 'welcomed' a NCR Garrison and Reno became an 'associated state'. At home, Tandi's fierce regulation against wealthy ranchers, the so-called Brahmin Barons, and rich trading monopolies ensured prosperity and support for the Republic and revived dreams of a better world. Tandi's successor, Tibbett, continued the good times, and all thought the Republic's good times would last forever. \n\nBut the fate of the Republic changed forever in 2253, when a caravan of 38 NCR citizens journeying from Arizona to Baker was attacked by raiders in the Northern Mojave, at the time a desolate no-man's land. President Tibbett, following Tandi's mould of preferring diplomacy to brute force, was slow to react to the crisis. While Tibbett dithered, opportunistic senators smelled blood, most notably Wendell Peterson, who demanded military assistance for the crisis. Peterson enchanted Tibbett with the promise that the bear had claws. Peterson's inauguration showed the limits of the NCR's progress. Peterson allied himself with the Brahmin Barons and relied on increasingly militaristic, expansionist policies to win the support of the population. As the Brahmin Barons rose and the vast expansion of the military continued, the NCR started a haphazard period of stagnation. Fueled by Baron and Caravansary money, the Republic entered a harsh cycle of consumerism and corruption. Sure, the Republic thrived, but it was no longer ordinary people gaining most from the growth. \n\nBy 2275, much of Northern California was run from Redding by the Barons themselves, benefiting from NCR protection while contributing little of their own. The Navarro territories, liberated with Brotherhood assistance, are a seething frontier. And the Mojave, well... as they say, the House always wins."

  ncr_early.4.d:0 "Life in the Wasteland isn't simple: especially not for a democracy as cumbersome and problem-riddled as the NCR. After decades of decadent decline under the premiership of Peterson and Kimball, the Republic is facing a number of crises on many fronts. In the south, Dayglow faces off with raider groups along the Colorado and in Baja who threaten the blooming city's security and prosper.  The Brotherhood lurks in its bunkers, and whether they will be friend or foe is too soon to tell.  San Francisco, nominally a friend of the Republic, pursues its own designs under the Shi. The Barons continue to run roughshod over the people of Northern California.  With the NCR distracted, Vault City and Navarro debate their own course.  \n\nBetween now and the 2278 election, the NCR will face a number of §Rcrises§! that it must react to. When these arise, they will be put to the Senate.  Who prevails will decide the fate of the election of 2278."

  ncr_early.5.d:0 "The NCR may be a bit different from what you're used to. There are no chieftains, town bosses, kings, or dictators here. Our leaders are elected by the people! That's right -- every state has the right to send representatives to the Hall of Congress. These representatives select the President and Vice-President to head the council and it is their advice which guides the President's decisions. The Senate election of 2278 will decide, ultimately, who becomes the next president. President Kimball is likely to remain in office, but he faces opposition at home."

  ncr_early.6.t:0 "The Nightmare in Navarro"
  ncr_early.6.d:0 "The Frontier has collapsed into recriminations and violence. San Franciscans fire upon Californians; tribals sound the drums of war and take up their old raiding ways. In Shady Shands, NCRR carries the heated arguments in Congress to the entire Wasteland, as Kimball prepares to deploy forces to intervene. But Murphy is a fierce opponent in the 'kitchen sink' debates. "Who will you declare war on?" The tribals, our citizens? The lawful immigrants from San Francisco? The Brotherhood, who you claim stokes the conflict? If you want to invoke war powers, then tell us who, in Dharma's name, we are at war with? How convenient, that every enemy of your untrammeled expansion is in this war. Do you want to go to war with the dishes in my sink next?"

The Van Graffs and barons in Navarro trample the rights of tribals; they extort crops from the settlers from the Shi; and they smuggle guns and drugs to Oregon. Now you ask NCR soldiers to fight and die for them?\" \n\n Kimball waited for the cries to die down, and slammed a fist on the podium. \"Spare me your moral condescension, Murphy. As far as I can see, it is only the Republic that takes risk for humanity. It is our rangers that cracked down on cannibalism in Navarro. Our merchants who sold the Shi their farming tools. And our settlers that tamed the mighty forests of the north. Some of the men fight for nothing more than the flag and their own interest. But we stand by the people of Navarro, and the Republic - the one society that goes out armed for right, and for freedom. And we will not surrender our hard won lands so you can feel smug at home.\""

  ncr_early.10.d:0 "Spurred to action by a swell of public outrage following the Navarro War, a bipartisan group of Senators have demanded the opening of a Senate enquiry into the events that unfolded. The Senate has, of course, complied with their demand, and now a probe dominated by Allgood supporters has begun digging for evidence the attack was spurred by lax Republic expansionism.

Recent economic development has attracted thousands of citizens to this city, attracted to the promise of a bright tomorrow.  But not every one can succeed, unfortunately.

  ncr_early.14.t:0 "Reinforcements from Shady Sands"
  ncr_early.14.d:0 "Seemingly as an act of unilateral goodwill, the government in Shady Sands has allocated a small portion of their untrained reserves to us. While they won't come equipped or battle-ready, the NCR has also been kind enough to send us enough money to train them up to fighting form. It's not perfect, but it's certainly better than nothing."

  ncr_early.15.t:0 "Wendell Peterson's War"
  ncr_early.15.d:0 "In May 2253, a gang of raiders attacked a large trade convoy outside Nipton. Despite a heroic defence by the caravan's guards, all 38 members of the convoy were massacred, and their extensive supplies of food, water and weapons looted. Joanna Tibbet, Tandi's successor to the Presidency, was subsequently removed from power by the Senate over her refusal to commit troops to secure the Mojave. Her replacement, Wendell Peterson, proved more plyable to the Senate's bullish rhetoric, ordering three battalions of Troopers into the Mojave under the command of then-General Aaron Kimball in October. For the following decade Kimball made a name for himself as the principle architect of the \"Pacification of the Mojave\", and under his leadership the NCR captured much of its current holdings. \n\nShortly after Kimball's depature from the Mojave in 2273, Ranger scouts made two shocking discoveries: the intact Hoover Dam, and a mostly undamaged Las Vegas. Now-President Kimball ordered the Dam conquered as his first act of office in 2274, and the subsequent Treaty of New Vegas ensured peace with Mr House. However, these successes quickly evaporated as supply and logistic issues plague the region, and casualties are ever-increasing in what was pledged to be a quick and easy campaign. Without help, the Expedition is sure to collapse from exhaustion, but we can only spare so much."

There are no children in need of schools; no sick in need of care. There are no farmers who need assistance, no neighbors who need a hand. To spend as much blood and treasure as we have, all must be good." \n\nOne of Kimball's other critics is Mayor Hayes of Dayglow. Mocked for his Old World Blues, Hayes studied America's past, the days when a nation stretched from sea to shining sea, with influence extending from pole to frozen pole. Hayes opposes the war in the Mojave because the resources spent there should be spent to uplift the Republic. Indeed, Hayes is perhaps the only NCR politician who does not just respect House, but admires him."

Dharma was one of the great teachers before the War, who prophesied that mankind's greed and folly would lead to death and destruction. Only by following the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path could mankind avoid the endless horror of unchanging war. Understandably, the faith, mocked as a Californian cult before the war, flourished in its aftermath. Dharma's presence isn't as flashy as a Ranger outpost or a Crimson Caravan station; but the faith makes its presence known through soup kitchens, hospitals, and its ties to the Followers. For a single candle can light thousands; and the light is not decreased by being shared."

I vow to continue the work I started when I became the President of this fair Republic, and continue to fiercely defend her borders on all fronts. Over the past five years our Troopers have brought victory after victory across the Wasteland: from driving back the Brotherhood on the coat to pacifying the Mojave, and from ridding Baja of our enemies to securing our northern borders, the NCR's military continues to be the pride of the world.\" \n\nSenators across the room murmured in support. Kimball's bullish, hardline military stances had indeed brought some security to a Republic long plagued by raiders and monsters. \n\n\"I sincerely promise, so long as I continue to command the support of this Senate and the people, to never yield in the face of an enemy to the Republic, within or without. Never again will we back down from defending our people, and never again shall we cut unjust deals.

For thirty days, [NCR.GetLeader] had clung to power. Every Senator knew he was a lame duck, doomed to be replaced. No Senator knew who the replacement would be. \n\n\"Senators, we find ourselves in a crisis never seen before by our fair Republic.  Corruption and a hunger for power have tainted this Congress, and have rendered it unable to elect a new President to lead the Republic forwards. For thirty days, you have deliberated without success. Deals have been struck and abandoned. Dirty money has run amok.\" \n\nThe Senators shuddered. They shuddered not because they minded being called corrupt, or hungry for power: all knew most in Congress were both. Instead they shuddered because they realised as one what his next words would be, and why he had summoned them. They shuddered for they knew with his next words, Kimball was rolling the dice one last time. \n\n\"We must have a President. Without one, unrest grows in our towns and cities, in our states and territories. Our enemies across the Wasteland, and within our borders, have already begun plotting against us in our moment of weakness. I cannot let that happen.\" \n\nA deathly silence descended over the chamber. \n\n\"By the power vested in me by Congress, I will remain the President of the Republic until a fresh election can be held and a new candidate agreed.\" \n\nChaos."

Led by members of the military and civil service, the coup's ringleaders have declared a \"Committee for National Security\", citing the need for political stability in the face of the Republic's many internal and external foes. While initially promising fresh elections, hope for a return to democracy evapourated after they signed into law the "Law to Remedy the Distress of People and California". The Decree effectively abolishes the federal foundations of the NCR, centralizes power in Shady Sand. \n\nThe governments of Boneyard, Dayglow and Redding were quick to denounce the Decree as illegitimate and label the Committee's assention to power as little more than a military coup.

Murphy and the Followers led protests for human rights and reports of Legion spies among the demonstrators only proved the pacifists could not be trusted.  The latest intercepted communiques made it clear; Murphy was conspiring to overthrow the Committee! Mossman had no choice but to act.

Pushed out of the their garrisons within the Mojave and forced to make a fighting retreat along the Long 15, the Mojave Territories have officially capitulated. A tentative peace deal has ended hostilities in the region for now, and the bulk of the Mojave Expedition's men have been reabsorbed into the Republic's armed forces. \n\nNow, with [252.Owner.GetName] in control of the Hoover Dam and the Republic's influence in the Mojave collapsing, the NCR will surely need a period of soul-searching to work out what went wrong.

  ncr_crisis.6.d:0 "Major Cassandra Moore was in Shady Sands when the fateful day arrived. She had been reassigned to oversee the Shady Sands Garrison just days after the election on the authority of General Jim Marshal, for reasons she didn't at first understand. As such, she'd seen first hand the Republic's rapid slide into chaos: a Senate in disarray, a President trying to hold back the innevitable, and days of agonising paralysis. To her the crisis seemed like yet another symptom of the Republic's flawed democracy, one that was becoming increasingly in need of dramatic change to save. The President was still in power, and some legitimacy remained, so she kept order on the streets as best she could. \n\nThere was a knock at the door of her windowless office, interupting her quiet musings. It was a man she recognised well, Ranger General Mossman, covered in scortch marks and flanked by two Rangers from the 32nd.\n\"Good morning, Major Moore. It appears we have a bit of a situation.\" He spoke quickly, with his characteristic charm all but gone. Something had gone wrong, Moore realised. It should be General Marshal, not him! \nBefore she could question him, Mossman continued. \"A meeting of the War Cabinet has been attacked not but ten minutes ago. A bomb, contained in a briefcase sat under the table, detonated during the meeting. The President, Cabinet and military High Command are fine paste across the wall, and I was only saved by the hety table leg that sat between me and it.\" Shit, Moore though. Shit, shit, shit. Mossman pressed on. \"With the presumed death of General Marshal, you are now the highest ranking officer of the Army, as I am of the Ranger Corps. We need to work out a way forwards, and fast.\" \n\nWho planted the bomb that killed the President and his War Cabinet? Why was Mossman himself the only one spared a messy death? Why was Moore reassigned by Marshal to lead the garrison, yet not invited to the meeting? Questions abound, and yet few answers present themselves."
  ncr_crisis.6.a:0 "Without a solution, and fast, chaos is innevitable."
  ncr_crisis.7.t:0 "A United Front"
  ncr_crisis.7.d:0 "While Moore and Mossman have worked overtime to keep order in Shady Sands after the assasination of the President and his War Cabinet, the Republic is rapidly falling apart. Faith in democracy had held strong while there was still a President in power, but in the void that has followed his assasination the Republic's enemies have been swift at seeing opportunity. Without a President, they muse, there will be no person to order the deployment of divisions to counter their raids. Their recent probing attacks have probably proven their theory, and raider violence has blossomed across the Republic. The Senate, meanwhile, has continuted to be paralysed by indecision. In the face of the President's assasination and ever-growing chaos, they've fallen flat. Enough is enough. \n\nAt 09:04am, Ranger and Army units moved in sync to occupy key buildings across Shady Sands. Within minutes, the Senate, Presidential Palace and Radio Transmitters had all been occupied. Ten minutes later an unamed civil servant broadcast a statement over the Wasteland: the Committee for National Security hsd assumed the powers of the President until the Senate can elect a new leader. \n\nWhile the precise members of the Committee are officially anonymous, most know the Committee to be an alliance between senior military and civilian officials. The sense of unity in the face of adversity seems reassuring to the people of Shady Sands. After all, they're just doing the necessary until the Senate can elect a new President. Right?"

Now the anarchists of the Boneyard are radically behind a Follower."

  ncr_crisis.10.d:0 "Mossman's raid took out Murphy and his govermnet.  But there were always those, in a democracy, to take a hero's palce. And so a Follower beecame a leader. A follower of Dharma and the teachings of Aradesh. A man who saw the worst of despotism, under Edward Sallow. On a speech on Boneyard Radio, Ed Calhoun laid the stakes clear. \n\n'A hundred years ago, the Wasteland was full of slavers. Raiders. Tough talking tyrants and despots. We lived in the shards of a broken world. \n\nThe NCR changed that. Aradesh, a village elder. Tandi, a naive girl. Julius, a foolish idealist. A sheltered Vault Dweller. They left a better, kinder, freer world for their children.  \n\nAnd so it must be for us. To many who mock the NCR as an imperialist state, thinking we walk the road of the Old World. But what's so funny about truth, justice, and the Californian way? What's so foolish about empathy and respect?"

The NCR had ignored the riches of the north for years, leaving it to develop on its own. But whereas the Mojave was a warzone, and Navarro was an untamed frontier, Redding had blossomed into a thriving town. A town where you could start as a caravan guard and end up as a king; or where you could lose a fortune at a saloon. A land of gold mines and monsters, and mutants and farms. Not a land where every man's a king - but a land where no man was. \n\nNot every ranger, or surviving Congressman, supported Moore and Mossman. Not every person who believed in freedom joined the mob of the Boneyard. Some fled to Redding, the last free state in the Republic. \n\nAnd the country roads took them to a new home, away from war."

  # Order
  ncr_order.1.t:0 "The Night of the Service Rifle"
  ncr_order.1.d:0 "It was 01:38am, and all was quiet at the Ranger Headquarters. Nestled amongst the military quarter of Shady Sands, the HQ served as the primary training, housing and administrative hub for the entire corps. At its heart sat Ranger General Mossman, caught in deep thought as he mused over the events of the past few weeks. Alongside Moore, he had done what was necessary to contain the ongoing crisis: that much he knew for certain. She was quick to come up with ideas, and effective at getting the job done. Yet something about her didn't sit quite right with Mossman. She was effective, sure, but she was almost too good. Every decision she made was quick and blunt, as if according not to a decision but instead to a plan. The thought troubled him. Why, was she of all people reassigned to Shady Sands shortly after the election? Why had her face contorted in concern only when he mentioned the grusome end of the military High Command, but not when he had mentioned the President? He paused, unwilling to follow the questions to their conclusion. Had she given the order for the Senate to be abruptly ended, blindsiding the Committee and his Rangers? \n\nSuddenly, successive streaks of bullets rang out through the still night, yanking Mossman out of his thoughts. He ran to the window, which overlooked the courtyard. Nothing? Then, in front of his eyes, a blinding flash at the main gate. The Headquater's piercing alarm switched on as Mossman watched the two great steel gates collapse inwards admidst a cloud of smoke. A second later, figures poured into the floodlit courtyard clad in sand-brown Trooper gear: the armour of the Baja veterans freshly redeployed two days ago at Moore's behest. Mossman turned, grabbing his two 10mm pistols from his desk as all hell broke loose in the courtyard. If he could just reach the barracks, he might yet organise a successful defence before Moore's troopers could capitalise on their suprise. Curse her! Was she behind it all, or merely seizing the oppertunity? He ran out his office and down the stairs. I must rally the troops and bring her to justice, he thought. It was too late. Troopers burst through the stairwell entrance as was half a flight of stairs away from them. All they found when they hit his office was an unidentifiable and scarred corpse decorated with Mossman's armour and dogtags with a gunshot to the temple."

Of course, it didn't last that way for long. Instead, it became an instrument to represent the uneasy alliance between Moore's Army and Mossman's Rangers as they both sought to quell growing unrest. Neither saw eye to eye, but both knew without such an alliance California would fall into true civil war, and as such the Committee became less a debating chamber of equals and more a place for Moore and Mossman to hammer out acceptable compromises.\n\nWith the framing and elimination of Mossman, and Moore enjoying credit from newfound victories on the fronts, the Committee is entirely under Moore's thumb. By proclaiming her President-General, reflecting her unified leadership of the civilian and military aspects of the state, we can mark an end to Mossman's weak morality and the start of a new, strong California. A California dedicated to reclaiming what was lost, through whatever means necessary. A California where none question their leader, and all are prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice to defend California's natural land."

All trampled under the Legion's banner. As someone believed in ahimsa, non-violence at all costs, he opposed Sallow as much as he could. After all his disagreements with 'Caesar', he returned to Boneyard to inform everyone about the grim news. \n\n Returning home as a changed man, he became more and more involved in teaching the common man in California. He spent his days teaching communities how to grow their own crops, hurting the monopoly of the Brahmin Barons, drawing their ire. Despite all the harassment from the Barons, he continued to travel town to town, teaching everything he knew to improve the lives of countless people across all the wasteland. This act of selflessness earned him many followers who preached his ideals to the wasteland, elevating him to the status of a public figure against the corruption and ever-growing militarization. \n\n Growing wearier every day, seeing the Republic plunge into chaos after the coup was the last straw for him. He called a protest, and when he called, the Republic answered. Thousands of small folk rose up for the man who helped them in their time of need. With a stimpak on one hand and a rifle on the other, Calhoun represents the ordinary man and the Californian Way.\n"

  ### Expansion EVents


  ncr_expansion.1.t:0 "~The Baja Blues~"
  ncr_expansion.1.d:0 "In the year 2256, the NCR Colony of Rattletail was established in the northern portion of Baja California. These brave pioneers received formal NCR funding, but little military protection, a choice which would prove fatal. The young colonists tried to develop the region's water supply, but Mexico's fearsome raiders tried to take their hard won gains. \n\nThe cartels retaliated against the small settlement, and launched two major assaults against the township, both of which were stopped with relative ease. It was the intervention and wisdom of a young Ranger, named Hanlon, that ended the dispute before the toll of the conflict became notable. The man crafted a clever lie, spouting nonsense about an army of raiders that would soon come and wipe the town away. The colonists evacuated, the locals regained their water-supply, and greater conflict was avoided. \n\nUnfortunately, this lie had an unintended result. But now [NCR.GetLeader] faces pressure to go south, and find new land for the Bear to trod upon."
  ncr_expansion.1.a:0 "Ranger Mossman goes with Kimball's support."
  ncr_expansion.1.a_tt:0 "§MKimball§! earned support Dayglow for cracking down on raiders!\n"
  ncr_expansion.1.b:0 "Héctor Santángel, a local Follower."
  ncr_expansion.1.c:0 "Mayor Hayes will organize development."
  ncr_expansion.1.c_tt:0 "\n§GHayes§! will earn support in the Boneyard for supporting the Followers.\n"


  ncr_expansion.2.t:0 "The Hub's Investments"
  ncr_expansion.2.d:0 "We've always had ties to the NCR, and for a while flirted with becoming a state! Sadly, they would never make the concessions the Bishops wanted in order to annex our charming little town.  But now Far Go Traders wishes to invest in our local economy. There is no denying that they could help us shift from a tourist based economy to something more permanent.  However, this will strengthen the Bishops' influence in our city, for they will mediate our stronger ties to the NCR."
  ncr_expansion.2.a:0 "Well, what's the worst that could happen?"
  ncr_expansion.2.b:0 "This is our turf."

  ncr_expansion.3.t:0 "Our Friends in Reno"
  ncr_expansion.3.d:0 "One of the cornerstones of the NCR is the free movement of people and goods between its states. The Far Go Traders' investment in Redding is the latest of many investments that are knitting California together. Let Hayes dream of rebuilding the old world; these ties are proof that we shall make a new one."
  ncr_expansion.3.a:0 "Peace is good for business."

  ncr_expansion.4.t:0 "A Monopoly?"
  ncr_expansion.4.d:0 "One of the cornerstones of the NCR Is the free movement of people and goods between its states. Thanks to hostility from the Van Graffs, our attempt to invest in Reno has failed, breaking this bond. Perhaps this is a sign that their influence goes too far. Already they use a militia to enforce their will throughout the north, and this is the latest in a string of insults. Perhaps we will need to take aggressive measures to save California, should they go too far."
  ncr_expansion.4.a:0 "We stand for the rule of law."


  ncr_expansion.5.t:0 "The Sierra Army Depot"
  ncr_expansion.5.d:0 "The Tribals placed a sign outside the Sierra Army Depot - 'No spirit guards these lands'. But we know that's foolishness; the 'spirits' were merely computer defenses which the Chosen One largely dismantled. Since then, the gangs of New Reno have had little interest in the facility, save for some limited research and salvage. But now the NCR asks to occupy the facility, in exchange for 'compensation'. There are those who think this is but the latest step towards occupying Reno directly. How shall we respond?"
  ncr_expansion.5.a:0 "We do not sell our land, only our drugs and sex workers."
  ncr_expansion.5.b:0 "...Generally, I mean. Sometimes we do!"

  ncr_expansion.6.t:0 "Our Sierra Army Depot"
  ncr_expansion.6.d:0 "As the heirs of America, it falls upon us to reclaim all the glory of the Old World. Sadly, [NEW.GetLeader] doesn't understand that, and the city rejected our request for the Sierra Army Depot. We will simply have to take it by force."
  ncr_expansion.6.a:0 "I liked Vegas better anyway."

  ncr_expansion.7.t:0 "Our Sierra Army Depot"
  ncr_expansion.7.d:0 "The families of Reno saw reason, and turned over the Sierra Army Depot to the Republic. Perhaps this is a sign we should trust them, after all."
  ncr_expansion.7.a:0 "They'll make a great territory, one day soon."


  ncr_expansion.8.t:0 "A Slave Uprising?"
  ncr_expansion.8.d:0 "[CES.GetLeader], it seems the treacherous profligates in the NCR have organized a slave uprising. Our brave warriors will be diverted from the front to deal with this until we've crushed them. While this is a manageable problem, some of the Legion are confused and quietly dismayed. What does the Bear promise that slaves risk death for?"
  ncr_expansion.8.a:0 "Nothing but base lies."

  ncr_expansion.9.t:0 "A Slave Uprising?"
  ncr_expansion.9.d:0 "[CES.GetLeader], it seems the treacherous profligates in the NCR have organized a slave uprising. Our brave warriors will be diverted from the front to deal with this until we've crushed them. While this is a manageable problem, some of the Legion are confused and quietly dismayed. What does the Bear promise that slaves risk death for?"
  ncr_expansion.9.a:0 "Nothing but base lies."

  ncr_expansion.10.t:0 "A New Import Tax"
  ncr_expansion.10.d:0 "[ARR.GetLeader], we have long had peaceful and prosperous ties with the NCR. Given our neighbors to the north, it has always been our dominant trading partner. But now the Republic wants to squeeze our trade with a new "import-export tax". This effectively amounts to stealing some of our resources. If we do not go along with this, the Republic has threatened to seize Four Ways as buffer territory against the 'Oregon Cannibals'."
  ncr_expansion.10.a:0 "We must go along with this threat. For now."
  ncr_expansion.10.b:0 "We didn't beat the Enclave and the Master to face a new tyrant!"
  ncr_expansion.10.b_tt:0 "The NCR will commence a §Rborder war!§!"

  ncr_expansion.11.t:0 "The Northern Threat"
  ncr_expansion.11.d:0 "[ARR.GetLeader] refused our request that they subsidize the war effort against the Legion. This means that they may, in fact, become a threat to the Republic.  Recall Mr. President, their messianic 'Chosen One' met with gangsters, pornographers, slavers, and the Brotherhood during his travels. Can we doubt that he would threaten the NCR if it benefited his people? We should take a forward position to defend ourselves against any upcoming threats from the Great Blight North. "
  ncr_expansion.11.a:0 "Seize Four Ways."
  ncr_expansion.11.b:0 "Seize Happy Camp."
  ncr_expansion.11.c:0 "Seize Eureka."


  ncr_expansion.12.t:0 "Trade Talks"
  ncr_expansion.12.d:0 "President Kimball's traveled to Reno to host trade talks with our fair city. In exchange for lowering tariffs on brahmin and leather products, Kimball has promised to consider legalizing prostitution throughout the Republic after the election. This of course will gain support for those who favour the NCR within our fair city, while Redding's brahmin barons will be happy to step up exports."
  ncr_expansion.12.a:0 "Ain't politics grand?"

  ncr_expansion.13.t:0 "We Have the Plant, But He Has the Power "
  ncr_expansion.13.d:0 "President Kimball has ordered us to divert additional power to Shady Sands during the campaign season.  Unfortuantely, our infrastructure isn't quite up to this, but the site of new lights in California will boost his support. And given Hayes' ambivalence about the Mojave, perhaps he knows what's best."
  ncr_expansion.13.a:0 "Well, he is the president..."

  ncr_expansion.14.t:0 "Victory at Sierra Army Depot!"
  ncr_expansion.14.d:0 "The Republic was victorious, and seized the Sierra Army Depot from Reno. To think of all the bloodshed that would've been avoided if they gave in to our demands."
  ncr_expansion.14.a:0 "Why didn't they listen to reason?"


  ncr_expansion.15.t:0 "Defeat at Sierra Army Depot!"
  ncr_expansion.15.d:0 "The militarists and gangsters of Reno held out against our army outside the Siera Army Depot. We would finisht eh job, but must focus on other priorities. But one day..."
  ncr_expansion.15.a:0 "Why didn't they listen to reason?"

  ncr_expansion.16.t:0 "The Sierra Armyy Depot Ceasefire!"
  ncr_expansion.16.d:0 "Although the Depot rightfully belongs to the Republic, Kimball decided we should postpone further bloodshed for now. Proof that he is one of the Republic's greatest leaders."
  ncr_expansion.16.a:0 "We'll be back."

  ncr_expansion.17.t:0 "Stepping on the Bear's Toes"
  ncr_expansion.17.d:0 "At great cost, we drove Kimball's incursion towards the Sierra Army Depot back.  He now blames this on aggressive officers who will be dispatched to Baja. While we are rather skeptical, I suppose it's for the best..."
  ncr_expansion.17.a:0 "Why didn't they listen to reason?"

  ncr_expansion.18.t:0 "Gored by the Bear"
  ncr_expansion.18.d:0 "At great cost, Kimball's forces occupied the Sierra Army Depot. This is embarassing for us, but what else can we do?"
  ncr_expansion.18.a:0 "Why didn't they listen to reason?"


  ncr_expansion.19.t:0 "Reminders of Home"
  ncr_expansion.19.d:0 "Shady Sands has sent men, materiel, and mutants to aid our hold over the Mojave. The package includes support for another generator, some heavy weaponry, and they even used Bear Force One to send ice cream!"
  ncr_expansion.19.a:0 "I hope there's a letter from my Ma!"
  ncr_expansion.19.a_tt:0 "\nThere is. And she even sent you a §Mcake!§!"

  ncr_expansion.20.t:0 "An Order From Shady Sands"
  ncr_expansion.20.d:0 "It looks like [NCR.GetLeader] has submitted another order to the Chop Shop. Due to the, ah, freedom loving libertarian government of Reno, we cannot stop them from fulfilling the order. But at least we get a cut? \n\nObviously, this will encourage the Republic's supporters in the [NEW.GetName]."
  ncr_expansion.20.a:0 "There are worse things than money, I guess."

  ncr_expansion.21.t:0 "A Fresh Batch Of Officers"
  ncr_expansion.21.d:0 "Shady Sands sent us a fresh bash of officers for the front, and some equipment acquired from Van Graff stockpiles. This will undoubtedly come in handy!"
  ncr_expansion.21.a:0 "I'm glad they care about us. "

  ncr_expansion.22.t:0 "An Unexpected Package"
  ncr_expansion.22.d:0 "Our research in Navarro has borne fruit, helping us understand some of the prewar technologies.  But we've found a few items that we cannot decipher - bearing strange markings and sigils from the Old World. \n\nOne of OSI's scientists suggested we ship the device to the Divide, to see if our scientists there can make sense of it. Others think we should just leave it here - alas, that means we may never understand this treasure."
  ncr_expansion.22.a:0 "Maybe they can make sense of it?"
  ncr_expansion.22.b:0 "Ship a package? At these prices?"

  ncr_expansion.23.t:0 "A Victory for the Republic!"
  ncr_expansion.23.d:0 "It appears that little package we sent to the Divide unlocked certain key systems. Already we're learning a great deal that can be applied across California. A salute to Kimball, Hayes, and the OSI!"
  ncr_expansion.23.a:0 "Hurrah!"

  ncr_expansion.24.t:0 "The End of the World"
  ncr_expansion.24.d:0 " Sand, ash... the dead... the Divide skies became a graveyard today. Somehow, it seems that a series of nuclear explosions rocked that peaceful little town, the NCR's lifeline to the Mojave. Radiation storms now scour the area, and we must ask - how could this happen? And is this the shape of things to come?"
  ncr_expansion.24.a:0 "Did the Legion do this?"
  ncr_expansion.24.b:0 "Huh. Glad it's not our problem."

  ncr_expansion.25.t:0 "The Bear's Indigestion"
  ncr_expansion.25.d:0 " Although the NCR prevailed over the Legion, it  now faces a new problem; what does it do with its new far flung dominion? Arizona, New Mexico, and lands beyond were never united before the Legion. Is the NCR going to administer this vast empire? Who can tame a wilderness so immense?"
  ncr_expansion.25.a:0 "I shouldn't have had seconds!"

  ncr_expansion.26.t:0 "I Won't Forget That Night in San Francisco"
  ncr_expansion.26.d:0 " San Francisco, and the Shi, are an oddity - somehow, this prosperous port and city surrounded by Republic influence is oft-neglected as we focus on New Vegas. Indeed, one could walk the streets of House's little treasure and never hear of it! But it's a center of scientific engineering, home to a prosperous, warrior people; and also, fortunately for us, divided into exploitable kung fu schools.  Whatever our decision about the city, we should make sure it's guided by the Wasteland's greatest nation."
  ncr_expansion.26.a:0 "You know, their tech would've been real useful at Hoover Dam."


  ncr_expansion.27.t:0 "The End of the Bear's Hibernation"
  ncr_expansion.27.d:0 "We hoped we would be fortunate enough to avoid the Republic's attentions now that it's focused on the Mojave. But it appears [NCR.GetLeader] is interested in us, and now seeks to cement our ties to the Republic. This is... problematic, to say the least. Perhaps we shouldn't have meddled in Navarro? \n\nOn the other hand, California's markets are profitable to us. There's money to be made there; and money buys power, in this fallen world."
  ncr_expansion.27.a:0 "The best way to be friends with a bear is to sit far way."

  ncr_hayes.1.d:0 "There was a time when America meant something, in the world. When its armies shielded its people across an ocean. When its scientists solved the resource shortages that held back progress and held the stars in their grasp. When its people were protected by governments and businesses that looked out for them. \n\nBut look at the NCR now - devoted to untrammeled expansion for no end, falling under the sway of brahmin barons and caravan companies. Is this the future of the NCR? Mutant cows? Pitiful merchants, walking from place to place? No. We can make the American dream a reality, and revive the ideals of 2076."

  ncr_hayes.2.t:0 "Forwards, Not Backwards"
  ncr_hayes.2.d:0 "Congress listened silently as Hayes gave his speech. "I will not sit here and say the Enclave was good. On the contrary, it was the gravest threat to California since between the Master and the Brotherhood, who were, of course, followed by the Legion. Truthfully," he chuckled, "we might save time to list our friends instead of our foes."  \n\n"But shall we cut off our nose to spite our face? Just as Caesar looks to one fallen empire, why shouldn't we? There is much we can learn from the remnants of the US government. And much we must learn, if we want to stand as tall as the Americans."  Hayes paused, and adjusted his glasses. "Besides, what do we stand for, if not forgiveness? One of the promises of the Republic is that no one in the Wastes is beyond redemption, beyond hope. If we could forgive the super mutants, we can certainly forgive our fellow Californians.""

At those words the a hush descended on the bar, as everyone turned their eyes to the new television. The screen flickered, and then he appeared! In living colour! \n\n"Didn't I promise you that you wouldn't recognize the Republic when I was through?" Hayes smiled, to each and every Californian watching. "Now look at us! We sacrificed much. All gave some; and some gave all. But working together, the people of California avenged the Redding Massacre. We held the Dam. We liberated Vegas. What could possibly stop us now? Do not look back on what we've accomplished.  Look forward to what we will do tomorrow. And a Happy Unification Day to you all!" \n\nOne Follower outside Vegas watched silently. "We may be going full speed ahead, but we're looking backwards the whole time."  He kept that to himself, though. Such thoughts were not to be shared, in the Pacific States."

Still, none can deny that they've laid the foundations for a strong military - as long as they finish their contracts. Some call this controversial, but Kimball sees this as an effort to improve ties with one of Redding's most successful businesses. \n\n§RShould the Van Graffs ever oppose the Republic, this may complicate our relations . . .§!"

  ncr_election.1.t:0 "The Best Form of Government"
  ncr_election.1.d:0 "Kimball may have survived a vote of No Confidence, but Mayor Hayes is still standing up for the common man and the Californian dream. In contrast to Murphy's populism and Kimball's nationalism, Hayes campaigns for a government that works. As he put it in his campaign declaration, 'The Republic is like a mutfruit pie. Murphy tried to take a share of your neighbor's pie. Kimball would take someone else's pie. But we can, by working together, simply make more. Technology made our ancestors the richest, strongest people on the planet. And it can do so again. \n\nMurphy's role in the Vote of No Confidence has played a role in his support, and the Republic gears up for one of its toughest elections to date. Who will win? The Man with a Plan, or the Architect of the Mojave? \n\nLet Caesar or the Shi mock the mob rule of California. Let Vault City judge the protestors and rallies that accompany elections. The people of California know that for all its problems, there is nothing wrong with California that cannot be cured by what is right with California. And the Wasteland's greatest nation prepares to choose the man to carry them forward."

  ncr_election.5.t:0 "The Best Form of Government"
  ncr_election.5.d:0 "When Reno and Vault City joined the NCR as the 'Commonwealth of Nevada,' it was contingent upon Nevada's citizens having the rights of all nativeborn NCR citizens. This included, to much surprise, the right to run for president. Kimball may have survived a vote of no confidence htanks in part to the Nevada success sory, but Granite now stands up for the common man and spirit of 76. \n\nBut what is that spirit, the Wasteland wonders. The spirit of Revolution, from the Ancient Americans? Or the spirit of prosperity from 2076? Granite's main avenue of attackk is to rally against the senatorial structure of the Republic, and to push for the Republic's citizens voting directly for president. But many people find Granite's campaign to be nothing but empty promises. To woo the states of the Republic, Granite will have to stake out some positions of his own."

  ncr_grdeals_desc:0 "The Gun Runners are the largest arms dealers in the Wasteland. Let El Generalissimo pretend that running guns to Caesar will make him rich. We don't need to cut deals with a cigar chewing kleptocrat with our industry at our back."

  ncr_grliscense:0 "Gun Runner Licensing"
  ncr_grliscense_desc:0 "The Gun Runners have quickly proven themselves as the superior weaponsmiths in the wasteland, and more so, our recent efforts to fund them have put them into a position where they can sustain a far greater output in a reliable way. Efforts are already being made in congress to make them the sole provider of firearms to the NCR's military, we need only approve this motion."

  ncr_drummond1:0 "Drummond's Army "
  ncr_drummond1_desc:0 "Alexander Drummond is obsessed with the armies of the old world, and has spent much of his long life studying the tactics of the old world. The unification of arms and overeager integration of transport vehicles, artillery and the overwhelming firepower of tanks. Drummond dreams of an NCR military that has the tools to deal with any foe."

  ncr_blast:0 "Blast from the Past"
  ncr_blast_desc:0 "The cannon revolutionized warfare, rewriting the playbook time and time again. It seems that the wasteland has forgotten the cannon, for so many nations forgo its usage. However, the NCR is in a unique position to gather and make use of such weapons; something Drummond fully intends to do."

  ncr_mobile:0 "Army of Mobility "
  ncr_mobile_desc:0 "The ability to move troops and supplies from place to place is a key feature in any army, and while the NCR has some capacity to do this, it is currently treated as an afterthought to be used in choice situations, rather than as an element of core NCR doctrine. This must be remedied if the NCR is to push forward militarily."

  ncr_spear:0 "The Tip of the Spear "
  ncr_spear_desc:0 "Drummond has spent decades collecting information from scattered libraries and military installations, exploring the usage of the now elusive tank through the ages. Warfare in the wasteland, and the limited volume of tanks has made the vast majority of these tactics invalid, yet it has also given Drummond the insight needed to formulate his own new doctrine of vehicular warfare."

  ncr_jim:0 "Big Jim's Army "
  ncr_jim_desc:0 "Big Jim is not a particularly complicated man when it comes to tactic, he values bravery and loyalty in his troops above any particular strategy or methodology. In many ways, this makes Big Jim's army overwhelmingly inflexible, but at the end of the day? The introduction of simple drills once taught to him by the Desert Ranger should allow the NCR's average soldier to rise to new heights."
  ncr_jim_tt:0 "§OGain a 10% bonus to heat attrition."

  ncr_drills:0 "Infantry Drills"
  ncr_drills_desc:0 "As odd as it may seem, one of the first things the Big Jim elected to do after being appoint as leader of the NCR's military was to reinvent the wheel when it came to their incredibly rudimentary infantry drills. The integration of simple squad tactics and more complicated marksmanship and urban assault tactics should have a marked improvement on the average soldier in the NCR's Military."

  ncr_march:0 "Military March "
  ncr_march_desc:0 "The marching drills of Big Jim have been met with resounding frustration from the average soldier, who loathes the idea of marching for days on end even after one has met the physical requirements. The point of these exercises is to increase the overall mobility of infantry as a unit, rather than individuals. This standardization of mobility and increased mileage on foot soldiers is a general boon."
  ncr_march_tt:0 "§OGain 10% division speed and 5% organization boost."

  ncr_draft:0 "The Big Jim Draft"
  ncr_draft_desc:0 "The Big Jim Draft is something few people actually expected to see, as many in the NCR feel that conscription is one of the leading issues in relation to the quality of the NCR's military forces, yet as Jim's doctrine stresses the importance of overwhelming numbers of high quality infantry, the need to enlist more men and women, willing or otherwise, is a necessity."

  ncr_rangergenmossman:0 "Mossman's Army"
  ncr_rangergenmossman_desc:0 "Ranger General Mossman has something of a disdain for the average soldier in the NCR, and views them as an awkward, blunt tool, better for pinning an enemy down than actually accomplishing anything in particular. To this end, he believes in the expansion and increased importance of the Rangers, and instead puts much of his funding towards improving them."

  ncr_rangercore:0 "The New Ranger Corps"
  ncr_rangercore_desc:0 "The increased funding, diverted from that usually given to the NCR's common army, has had a notable impact on the Rangers in general.

  ncr_rangercore_tt:0 "§OGain 25 more special forces cap.§!"

  ncr_rangerlead:0 "Rangers Lead the Way"
  ncr_rangerlead_desc:0 "Rangers are, above all other things, special forces capable of infiltration and reconnaissance. Ranger General Mossman employs a relatively simple approach to large scale engagement, one that involves using rangers to scout ahead of a main body of infantry in order to assess the ideal location for an engagement and to counter any and all moves an enemy might make."

  ncr_rangercanopeners:0 "Ranger Can-Openers"
  ncr_rangercanopeners_desc:0 "Ranger General Mossman, like many within the NCR Rangers, feel that the Brotherhood of Steel are easily the most dangerous threat that the NCR faces to this date, a thorn in the side of the republic who use their advanced technology to bully the commonfolk of the NCR. To this end, special drills and tactics are being developed by the Rangers, informally referred to as can opener techniques."

  ncr_mechcore:0 "Mechanized Corps"
  ncr_mechcore_desc:0 "The NCR is one of the few nations in the world capable of sustaining a sizeable fleet of support vehicles and motorized support. While these vehicles fill a largely logistical role, on rare occasion one can find these divisions risked on daring envelopment techniques against the NCR's more slippery foes."

  ncr_shock:0 "Shock Companies"
  ncr_shock_desc:0 "The introduction of the APC to the NCR's military could be a game-changer in wars against more powerful foes, such as the Legion or the Brotherhood of Steel. To this end, the mass production of vehicles for so called 'shock battalions' has become a priority for those in the highest echelons of military command."

  ncr_rapid:0 "Rapid Advance Doctrine"
  ncr_rapid_desc:0 "The Motorized corps of the NCR is in many ways, a separate entity to the army itself. It shares few commanders and has incompatible tactics and strategies when in battle. The improved integration of these forces and a greater unity in tactics could allow the NCR to make better use of this valuable strategic advantage."

  ncr_draft2:0 "Combined Arms"
