  # ACH (Alamo Chapter)
  ACH_energy_equipment_1:0 "Laser Pistol"
  ACH_energy_equipment_1_short:0 "Laser Pistol"
  ACH_energy_equipment_1_desc:0 "The AER9 was actually not the top laser rifle in service at the time of the Great War. The model line went up to the state-of-the-art AER12, which saw service in a handful of speciality units. The reason that the AER9 is much more commonly found is that it was much sturdier and more reliable than the models that followed."

  ACH_spec_ops_equipment_4_desc:0 "Originally designed to serve as the under-armour for T-45d power armour, recon armour is a vacuum-sealed asbestos jumpsuit that covers the entire body. While useful in its intended role, recon armour is renowned for being an effective armour for operations that require more mobility than traditional power armour can provide."

  # ARM (Ejército Mexicano)
  ARM_ballistic_equipment_2:0 "Paciencia Rifle"
  ARM_ballistic_equipment_2_short:0 "AM Rifle"
  ARM_ballistic_equipment_2_desc:0 "Few adversaries would consider a hunting rifle to be dangerous, yet they are gravely mistaken. It's threat comes from the fact it is a rechambered bolt-action, made to fire a shortened anti-material round able to pierce straight through most obstacles, and even light armor. What it gains in recoil, it makes up for in sheer firepower."

  # ARR (Arroyo)
#  ARR_ballistic_equipment_2:0 "Marksman Rifle"
#  ARR_ballistic_equipment_2_short:0 "Marksman Rifle"
#  ARR_ballistic_equipment_2_desc:0 "Arroyo's proximity to the NCR gave them more than enough opportunities to acquire their standard Service Rifle, and tweak it to their heart's desire. This modified version is expressly made for long-range squad support, with an elongated barrel, addition of a scope, and conversion to a DMR configuration able to fire high-velocity cartridges."

  # ASS (Assassin City)
  ASS_ballistic_equipment_2:0 "Blackjack Assault Shotgun"
  ASS_ballistic_equipment_2_short:0 "Assault Shotgun"
  ASS_ballistic_equipment_2_desc:0 "A rugged, magazine-fed, ultra-compact shotgun, the Blackjack fires a standard twelve gauge round out of a minimum-spec barrel, allowing maximum dispersion at close quarter. The reinforced frame, lack of stock, and short profile makes it a perfect weapon for drive-by shooting, as well as bashing someone's eye socket in. Add a bayonet, and you got a wonderful pocket eviscerator."

  # BAG (Baggers)

  BDT_melee_equipment_1_short:0 "Cult Knife"
  BDT_melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "A magnificently crafted knife, it's esotheric properties make any person in it's presence feel unease and gnawing despair as it's sight. The handle is made of polished bones, imbued with tainted blood to give it a red color, while a wave-bladed edge gives it a horribly wounding effect on strike, akin to a serrated edge. Perfect to spill blood in It's name."
  BDT_melee_equipment_2:0 "Cultist Sword"
  BDT_melee_equipment_2_short:0 "Cult Sword"
  BDT_melee_equipment_2_desc:0 "The cultist sword follows the tradition of venerating It's name even in warfare, but forgoes the esotheric shaped blade of it's dagger counterpart for a straight serrated edge to more easily spill blood and tear flesh. With it's handle shaped from the bones of heretics, and supernatural forces blessing the blade, it's vile energy seeps into every warrior in it's presence."

  BOS_melee_equipment_4_short:0 "Displacer Glove"
  BOS_melee_equipment_4_desc:0 "The displacer glove creates a shock wave upon impact similar to the one made by the Gauss rifle, both dealing a large amount of damage and pushing a target back. It possibly accomplishes this via a sonic blast, shown by the speaker on the knuckle."

  BOS_blimp_equipment_4_desc:0 "The pride of any post-war air force, a single Osceola Class Skyship is a force to be reckoned with, while several would be a yet-unseen projection of force across the wasteland. A flying military base capable of both aerial combat and air-to-surface bombardment, the Osceola is not just a superweapon, but also a symbol of military might."

  # BRK (Broken Coast)
  BRK_melee_equipment_1:0 "Fishbone"
  BRK_melee_equipment_1_short:0 "Fishbone"
  BRK_melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "Named for their menacing serrated edges and chalk white blades, fishbones are often made from the hulls of wrecked ships. Cheap, rusty metal often makes for the best shivs: the tetanus is an added bonus.\n\n"
  BRK_melee_equipment_2:0 "Gut Harpoon"
  BRK_melee_equipment_2_short:0 "Gut Harpoon"
  BRK_melee_equipment_2_desc:0 "Despite their deadly appearance, these broken harpoon tips on sticks are little more than unbalanced blunt rods. They're a favourite of Broken Coast raiders for their intimidating aura and unpredictability.\n\n"
  BRK_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Black Powder Pistol"
  BRK_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "Old Sidearm"
  BRK_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The lack of resources, weapon knowledge and manufacturing availability made flintlocks a common sight amongst the Broken Coast. Beyond it's simple sidearm function, a weighted grip makes it perfect for pistol-whipping during boarding, and a wide barrel let daring pirates load it with buckshot, before shredding any unlucky enemy in a blinding light and deafening blast."
  BRK_ballistic_equipment_1:0 "Little Marie"
  BRK_ballistic_equipment_1_short:0 "Little Marie"
  BRK_ballistic_equipment_1_desc:0 "Pistol sized shotguns that pack a bunch large enough to puncture holes in wooden ships, Little Maries are carried by every pirate worth his salt. Sickeningly, the name comes from a local folk tale about a girl who used a shotgun to murder her father.\n\n"
  BRK_ballistic_equipment_2:0 "Redbeard Cannon"
  BRK_ballistic_equipment_2_short:0 "Redbeard Cannon"
  BRK_ballistic_equipment_2_desc:0 "The feared Captain Redbeard from Port Maw inspired terror and awe in all who crossed him, the snap of his lever action rifle never leaving the men who faced him. So fearsome was his time at sea, that even decades after his demise, lever action rifles are still associated with him.\n\n"

  BRK_ballistic_equipment_3_short:0 "Sailor's Carbine"
  BRK_ballistic_equipment_3_desc:0 "Only the very bravest, or the very stupid, venture north into the frozen waters of Alaska. Those who return from the voyage bring back with them many bounties, one of which is always a Sailor's Carbine. Rare prewar weapons found only in the north, they are a mark of prestige, and possess deadly killing power.\n\n"

  BRK_energy_equipment_1_short:0 "Madman's Musket"
  BRK_energy_equipment_1_desc:0 "It takes a truly desperate man to strap a reaction chamber to a crank, duct-tape on a trigger, and face down the pirates knocking at his door—but that's what Madman Jack once did, or so they say. Laser muskets are popular among smarter crews who know the best spots for tech salvage.\n\n"
  BRK_energy_equipment_2:0 "Powder Monkey"
  BRK_energy_equipment_2_short:0 "Powder Monkey"
  BRK_energy_equipment_2_desc:0 "For the few pirate crews who make use of energy weapons and succeed in their dangerous careers, the next step is improving their weapons.

  BRK_energy_equipment_3_short:0 "Plaslock Pistol"
  BRK_energy_equipment_3_desc:0 "Uncovering plasma weaponry is an achievement any man should boast until his dying days, and for a pirate this is especially true. The men and women of the Broken Coast know one thing to be true: all good pirates carry flintlocks. To any vermin who gets their grubby hands on a plasma pistol, its true name be damned, it's a Plaslock!\n\n"

  CES_melee_equipment_2:0 "Machete Gladius"
  CES_melee_equipment_2_short:0 "Machete Gladius"

  CES_melee_equipment_3_short:0 "Bumper Sword"
  CES_melee_equipment_3_desc:0 "The bumper sword, as the name suggests, consists of a rusty car bumper that has been flattened and sharpened into a thick, heavy blade. The license plate is still attached, and an exhaust pipe strapped to the unsharpened end serves as a makeshift handle."

  CES_power_armour_equipment_2:0 "Brotherhood of Mars Power Armour"
  CES_power_armour_equipment_2_short:0 "BoM PA"
  CES_power_armour_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed to invoke the fury of Mars in battle, the Brotherhood of Mars created this variant of T-51b to outfit their legions with in the coming wars. Its mediocre materials make it worse in battle than regular T-51b, but for equipment designed by former luddites, it is exceptional."

  CES_heavy_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "Slave Collars"
  CES_heavy_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The total pacification collar (commonly referred to as a slave collar) is a pre-War prisoner control device developed at Big MT Research and Development Center, and adapted by slavers after the war for the purpose of capturing and forcing slaves into submission."

  # CHC (Chained Choir)
#  CHC_melee_equipment_1:0 "Prison Shiv"
#  CHC_melee_equipment_1_short:0 "Shiv"
#  CHC_melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "More commonly seen in the hands of prisoners trying to silence snitches than as mass produced weapon of war, the prison shiv is a simple improvised blade made primarily for piercing and stabbing than slashing at foes. It's deadly nature comes from the vicious tactics used alongside it, with wearers used to go for the jugular or arteries than fight fair."
  CHC_ballistic_equipment_1:0 "9mm Submachine Gun"
  CHC_ballistic_equipment_1_short:0 "9mm SMG"
  CHC_ballistic_equipment_1_desc:0 "The 9mm submachine gun is a classic that hardly needs an introduction. Improving upon the basic package, a telescopic assembly reduces it's size further, while higher quality cartridges crafted with increased powder load allows enhanced muzzle velocity and effect on soft target. Spray and Pray has never been this much fun."

  # CHO (Choctaw)
  CHO_ballistic_equipment_2:0 "Medicine Stick"
  CHO_ballistic_equipment_2_short:0 "Brush Gun"
  CHO_ballistic_equipment_2_desc:0 "Bringing a touch of old-world western action to post-war firefights, the updated 1886 Winchester is a classic appreciated by just about any tribal able to afford them. With a good rate of fire for a manually-cycled weapon, high accuracy, and tweaked iron sights, its suited for just about any situation encountered in the wasteland. Chambered for the powerful .45-90 Express, the cartridge is made to take down large predators such as Yao-Guai, deathclaws, or idiots in heavy armor."


  # CHR (Cherokee)
  CHR_ballistic_equipment_2:0 "M16A1"
  CHR_ballistic_equipment_2_short:0 "M16"
  CHR_ballistic_equipment_2_desc:0 "The result of scavenging and study of mothballed army equipment depots, the M16A1 is able to be manufactured easily and simply. An improved variant of the base M16 benefiting from a forward assist and improved internal components, it still features a 5.56mm assault rifle platform in a stable, accurate, and now highly reliable package. Perfectly suited for medium range, its full auto feature still lets it be devastating in room clearing."
  CHR_ballistic_equipment_3:0 "P90 PDW"
  CHR_ballistic_equipment_3_short:0 "P90"
  CHR_ballistic_equipment_3_desc:0 "A highly advanced European weapon imported to the United States to arm special operation units, the P90 has been discovered in army facilities, and studied to be manufactured en-mass.

  CLK_standard_weaponry_short: "Revolver"
  CLK_standard_weaponry_tech_desc:0  "From need comes ingenuity. While the clockwatchers appreciate immense firepower, it is certainly hard to acquire it, much less standardize it. Using scrap metal and abandonned forge around their territory, they managed to manufacture this huge, bulky sidearm, barely holding together with every shot of it's massive 200 grain .38 cartridge."
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_1:0 ".44 Revolver"
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_1_short:0 ".44"
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_1_desc:0 "As improvements came along to the standard Clockwatcher weaponry, a massive change was in order. The proper metal frame, reinforced cylinder, and elongated barrel makes this weapon a sight to behold. Firing the same .38 caliber cartridge, with improved recoil control and accuracy, means the same devastating stopping power in a reliable package."
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_2:0 "Improved .44 Revolver"
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_2_short:0 ".44 Improved"
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_2_desc:0 "Very little can be considered "improvement" when it comes to Clockwatcher weaponry, at least to them. As such, this sidearm was only called "Improved" when a crafty weaponsmith managed to have what amounts to a battle pistol fire a 350 grain, .44 cartridge without the whole gun going up with his hands. While pre-war movies tended to exaggerate their effect, this revolver can actually blow someone clear across a room"
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_3:0 "Revolver Rifle"
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_3_short:0 ".44 Carbine"
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_3_desc:0 "There comes a point in every revolver development where a hard limit is, sadly, reached in terms of firepower. Thankfully, that's where carbine convertions generally come in. With a solid stock, center-line assembly and elongated barrel, this revolver carbine can not only provide a more stable firing platform, but increase firepower even further by firing a full-length, super magnum .44 cartridge more commonly seen fired from heavy rifles."
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_4:0 "Railway Rifle"
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_4_short:0 "Pain Train"
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_4_desc:0 "An extremely bulky yet curious contraption, this converted railway spike driver has been fitted with a stock, barrel, and stand-alone power unit to be able to fire it's spike at long range. When bullets could no longer satisfy the Clockwatcher's need for increased firepower, this was a natural choice for a replacement. The spike itself is propelled at revolver-like velocity, themselves being huge .62 caliber metal rods able to literally nail an enemy to a wall."

  CHC_melee_equipment_1_short:0 "Brass Knuckles"
  CHC_melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "When a punch is thrown, you feel it. Transferring much of a punches kinetic energy to the target by way of the harder, smaller impacting surface of the metal knuckles. This drastically increases the likelihood of serious tissue disruption and bone damage."

  CRA_melee_equipment_4_desc:0 "The foolish earthlings think us weak in close quarter, owing to our small stature and frail constitution, but we haven't conquered the galaxy through intelligence alone! They'll be in for quite a shock when our shock batons, modified for maximum energy output, atomize them into a fine pink mist!"
  CRA_energy_equipment_1:0 "Zetan Pistol"
  CRA_energy_equipment_1_short:0 "Zetan Pistol"
  CRA_energy_equipment_1_desc:0 "Of the manifold magnificent monoliths maintained by the Zetan armies, this wondrously weird weapon is most famed for frequency of presence. The archetypical sidearm of the Zetan people is feared across the galaxy for its capacity to atomize--although it pales in comparison to the stabilized quark-gluon plasma bolts of the more advanced weaponry in the Zetan arsenal, its nightmarish atomic power still horrifies and entrances across the universe!"
  CRA_energy_equipment_2:0 "Zetan Blaster"
  CRA_energy_equipment_2_short:0 "Zetan Blaster"

Although the original model of the rifle was less advanced than the recharger pistol, this model has been tweaked in order to increase the rate at which energy is recharged, thus allowing for a faster firing rate than previously envisioned. The semi-auto configuration of the rifle will also allow soldiers to fire precisely and to help better conserve energy. On paper, this may put our troops at a disadvantage against enemies with fully automatic weapons.

It uses a drum containing six capacitors centered around an electron charge pack. when the trigger is pulled, the drum rotates, which brings a charged capacitor in line with the barrel and discharging mechanism, allowing for the discharged energy to exit as a laser. The spinning-drum design philosophy allows emptied capacitors to be recharged from the electron charge pack and ready to fire at a very fast rate and enables the Laser RCW to achieve rates of fire unavailable to single capacitor designs."

  OST_energy_equipment_3_desc:0 "Created by the Curators of The Order, these weapons have began to roll out of the workshops spread across the pacified land. The rifle has been constructed of broken AER-12 components, old bio-scanner parts, and odd scraps of metal. This, along with years of research as led the Curators to perfect this next weapon for their holy santitizers. The weapon includes two weapon modes, both sure to annhilate those who oppose holy purification."

  OST_energy_equipment_4_desc:0 "Only a few of these rifles officially exist. Unbeknownst to the rest of The Order, this weapon has been in development for the past six years. Only the most valued Curators have had access to the blueprints and prototypes of this powerful weapon. Originally, the idea was to create a weapon similar to a grenade launcher, but it has since evolved into the next evolution of the AEX-1. This model recieves a significant upgrade in the form of a Blue Flu scanner."

  OST_power_armor_equipment_desc:0 "Before the War, law enforcement deployed the much-vaunted power armour when the most dangerous situations arose. These specific models were rated for tackling HAZMAT situations, with special hermetic sealing protecting the user from even the freshest fallout. With the Forlorn and their disease encroaching ever closer, this weapon is needed on our streets more than ever. The blueprints for this armor have been recovered and our industry is ready to finally see these centuries-old plans realized. The Curators will have the power armour they deserve, order in Omaha will be restored, and the Plaguelands will be culled."

  OST_melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "Before the war, Omaha found itself in a unique position. Instead of the National Guard or regular army keeping order, the Omaha PD was the main peacekeeping force. As a result, local police armouries were kept full of various armaments. Unfortunately, the best gear from these caches has been looted a long time ago, but the classic police nightstick can still be found in abundance. Looks like some things haven't changed with age; once used to maintain order by American policemen, the Order will now put them to the same use in our own lands."

  OST_melee_equipment_2_desc:0 "Does this even need an introduction? A leather grip, a steel blade forged in the righteous fires of our forges and blessed by the Church's holy water, and a set of serrated teeth, ideal for dicing up enemy combatant and plagued monster alike. It's nothing fancy, but the combat knife is a timeless weapon that needs no reinventing."

  OST_melee_equipment_3_desc:0 "Take the serrated edge on the combat knife, turn that into a circular chain, and then make that chain turn at a high RPM. That's the Ripper in a nutshell. Designed as dual CQC weapon and engineering tool in an urban environment, the Ripper is ideal for ripping up both flesh and enemy fortifications with ease. It's no wonder that Curators on the frontline have fallen in love with it; there's nothing better to get yourself out of a Faceless horde than a weapon that does nothing but rip and tear until it's done."

  OST_melee_equipment_4_desc:0 "A tool turned into a weapon, Pre-War America used this to cut into large metallic structures before repurposing them for the war effort. We've managed to rig our own version of the plasma cutter by studying still-functioning cutter. The end result is a weapon that requires less resources than the original and can easily be jury-rigged for a quick fix, but the plasma stream isn't as stable. Not to worry though; our cutters can still slice through a Super Mutant's armor like it's thin air."

  OST_heavy_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Pre-War police uniform was one that was representative of those who donned it; arbiters of force commanding authority and order wherever they are needed. Basing our standard uniform off of this simple yet effective design will give our forces a simple, mass-produced uniform that, while not optimized for personal protection, will allow our men to be as agile as possible in the battlefield."

  OST_heavy_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "Military units deployed to the Plaguelands had a specialized version of the legendary riot gear used by the US Marine Corps. While it's not as protective as the version used in the drive to Beijing, it more than makes up for it in its protective value against corrosive and hazardous materials, almost perfect for trekking in a nuclear wasteland rife with all kinds of dangers. Now, with our own ability to mass produce this variant, our Curators and law enforcement will be near impervious to whatever dangers and hazards lay in wait for them."

Used by dissenting movements and individuals across the world before the War, we've now begun producing our own Molotovs with some makeshift wicks, scavenged Nuka-Cola bottles, and alcohol from hastily-built stills. They're no Pre-War high explosives, but is there any better sight than seeing the infected, filthy horde burned in the Order's holy fire?"
