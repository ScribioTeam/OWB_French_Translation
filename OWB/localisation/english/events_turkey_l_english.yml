  nf_turkey.1.t:0 "What are You Thankful For?"
  nf_turkey.1.d:0 "Americans celebrated Thanksgiving for centuries, going back to the first Pilgrims. Even in the aftermath of the Great War, people tried to keep the holiday alive, having a a can of beans, or a neighbour, as a treat to mark the day. The Wasteland's recovery over the last several decades have seen a return to the ancient feasts, with new characteristics. A side of mashed tatoes; mut fruit pie; tarberry sauce. But through it all, nobody asked the turkeys what they liked."
  nf_turkey.1.a:0 "Stuffing!"
  nf_turkey.1.b:0 "The pie! The pie!"

  nf_turkey.2.t:0 "In the Garden of Eden"
  nf_turkey.2.d:0 "The mutated GECK did strange, horrible, and wonderful things. Among those - Cranberry. Was it the GECK that gave him sentience? FEV? An experiment from the Chicago Enclave's marketing department? None can say. All that is known is he awoke to awareness in a farm, surrounded by his brethren. Cranberry escaped and hide in the corpse, teaching and sharing his ways. Why should the humans devour and consume all they surveyed. Were they any better than the mutants out east, who feasted upon human flesh? No. If the Wasteland is to change, then they must renounce their greed and selfishness. They must learn to share with others, and with nature. They must be thankful for the joys in life, their friends and loved ones, not possessions.  \n\n§RThey must be thankful for him.§!"
  nf_turkey.2.a:0 "Listen to me, mutants!"
  nf_turkey.2.b:0 "Hear me, Rangers!"
  nf_turkey.2.c:0 "Trust me, Cherokee!"

  nf_turkey.3.t:0 "The Thanksgiving Invitation"
  nf_turkey.3.d:0 "It appears that a giant turkey super-mutant has taken over part of Texas and now demands all the Wasteland come to Thanksgiving. He promises a splendid event which will never be forgotten.  Cranberry also threatens to set off a giant nuclear bomb if we fail to attend, so let's send a delegation!"
  nf_turkey.3.a:0 "Ugh, but what about Black Friday shopping?"

  nf_turkey.4.t:0 "Thank You For Being a Fan"
  nf_turkey.4.d:0 "As the last plates are cleared away, the characters of the Wasteland realize that perhaps, at least, they should be careful their Thanksgiving meals are not self aware going forward.  And they are filled with a renewed appreciation of thanks for all the developers who've made the Fallout series such fun. To everyone at Interplay, Black Isle, Osbsidian, Micro Forte, Bethesda, and Obsidian, thank you for Fallout. inXile, thank you for Wasteland. And our players, thank you for being you. Even the ones with Enclave profile pictures due to unresolved daddy issues."
  nf_turkey.4.a:0 "But seriously, when's the show coming out?"
  nf_turkey.4.a_tt:0 "We're giving you claims on Texas too, as a treat."
