  nf_bonedancers.1.t:0 "The Future-Tec G.E.C.K Research Facility"
  nf_bonedancers.1.d:0 "The "Bone Dancers" are the most feared of the cannibals in Oregon today, yet that was not always the case.\n\nOriginally, they were just a hired group of mercs - a privately owned military contractor based out of Seattle known as "Baron International". Before the great war this company was hired by Future-Tec, a subsidiary of Vault-Tec made to help fund the development of technologies designed to invigorate the wastes in the post-war landscape. Future-Tec brought on Baron International to help keep their researchers safe during the riots that were brought about by the New Plague.\nAfter the Great War occurred Baron International quickly took control of the situation - storming the facility and seizing control from the scientists there. They assumed that if they just held out long enough help would arrive when the government eventually came for them.\n\nThey never came.\n\nSeveral decades later and these mercs have turned their control of this facility into something like an iron grip. They were defending their small little corner of the wastes from other raiders, settlers and mutants through their training and policies against outsiders.\nIn their founding years they had to fight off an odd series of groups, which of them was the greatest?"

  nf_bonedancers.2.d:0 "Prosperity wouldn’t last forever for these survivalists. While the training of their ancestors allowed them to fight off rival tribes with ease eventually they were at an impasse - the lands themselves they were living in were dying, driven lifeless by the radiation blanketing the wastes. It was a slow, gradual process - but eventually something had to be done when starvation was killing more of their rank then raids.\nIn the late of night, a discussion was held - ultimately a decision was made as for what to do.\n\nThe mercs tallied a vote, when a small enough group was chosen they simply pulled straws until one pulled the shortest. He was sent to "Bone Dance" - uncover the secrets within the skeleton filled ruins of the old Future-Tec facility. This title would eventually fall onto the rest of the Mercs, a way of honoring those that took the plunge to scrap-dive into the seemingly cursed facility in the hopes of finding valuables and relics to help heal their dying lands.\nThese "Bone Dances" would bear fruit from time to time, but time was dwindling for the Bone Dancers. It was only with the timely arrival of a strange robed figure from the south that their luck seemed to shift.\nThis man, having lost his mind from some terrible experience had more foresight and knowledge than any of the rest of them - radiation baking his body and making him ageless. The Bone Dancers called him the "Odious King", and with his odd sense of foresight eventually they were able to uncover a small selection of partially functioning G.E.C.K.S that had been hiding in a deep shelter within the facility for ages.\n\nWhile the aid of this robed figure was most appreciated for the food he brought it is debated how he was first treated when he arrived by the locales. What did they think of such a mysterious and strange figure?"

  nf_bonedancers.3.d:0 "With these G.E.C.K.S found by the Odious King we were able to heal the land.. Yet not all was right. The machines themselves, through age, wear and corrosion had faltered somewhat. The biggest problem though? Radiation leaking through into the seeds contained within the machine itself. Often the greenery built by the machines was strange, corrupted and ‘cruel’. The fruit the trees bore was filling, yet it seemed to cause the mind to go to.. Strange places.\nEventually these lands grown by these G.E.C.K.S were known as the Crimson Forest, a scarlet land of confusion, oddity and madness. As the madness of the Crimson Forest gripped the Bone Dancers so to did it change them. Ritualised murder, cannibalism and slavery began to dominate the culture of those that lived in the forest - this culture even spreading out as splinter groups of the Bone Dancers began to wander off ot the west, such as the Carcass Walkers, Marrow Drinkers and Rib Breakers.\n\nNear the Future-Tec facility a group of fanatics have begun to worship the Odious King as a god while along the coasts a group of settlers from Heaven’s Gate have begun to try to clear out the forest itself!\nThe newest leader of the Bone Dancers will have to decide the best strategy for dealing with these differing groups."

  nf_bonedancers.4.d:0 "Recently a large deal of conflict has been occurring near our western border. While those loyal to Cranium aren’t too threatened by this both the Heaven’s Gate pilgrims on the coast and the Crimson Acolytes in their desolate temples feel that these invaders pose a threat to our hegemony.\nWe can, if we wish to prevent an invasion from across the Bend Valley in the next several years give a series of gifts and try to broker a peace deal. If we do, however, then it may be hard for Cranium to keep a hold of the Bonedancers as people start to lose faith in him."
  nf_bonedancers.4.a:0 "A worthy sacrifice to make"
  nf_bonedancers.4.b:0 "Fear them? Ha!"
  nf_bonedancers.5.t:0 "Bonedancers offer a treaty?"
  nf_bonedancers.5.d:0 "The Bonedancers have offered us a rather lucrative treaty. If we were to promise not to invade them then they are willing to give us a rather large amount of caps, resources and manpower to compensate us. This is a great deal and it would be silly not to accept!."
  nf_bonedancers.5.a:0 "This is a killer deal!"
  nf_bonedancers.5.b:0 "We refuse!"
  nf_bonedancers.6.t:0 "They accept!"
  nf_bonedancers.6.d:0 "Losing out on some of our resources will be rough - but this will allow us to direct our attention to different areas. That is our responsibility as a nation, now we can focus our efforts in the right direction."

  nf_bonedancers.8.d:0 "The Bone Dancers, the largest of the cannibal gangs to the south has sent a formal request to join the Northern League as equal allies. Having a buffer state to the south to protect us from the republics of the south will prove rather helpful - that, and there are rumors of some rather.. Interesting commodities deep in the Bondancer’s land."
  nf_bonedancers.8.a:0 "Perhaps they can be a good "ally"..."
  nf_bonedancers.9.t:0 "They rejected us!"
  nf_bonedancers.9.d:0 "Our diplomats sent to venture into the frozen lands of the north haven’t returned, this brings ill tidings to the prospect of an alliance between us and the ghosts of Capitol Hill. Looks like we are on our own!"
  nf_bonedancers.9.a:0 "Oh no!"
  nf_bonedancers.10.t:0 "An Enthralling Melody"
  nf_bonedancers.10.d:0 "The Odious King raised his hand and his acolytes listened. It was time to move into action.\nThe Odious King spoke with a strange cadence, as if fate had directed him to move only now, in this moment. His song was headed by the Crimson Acolytes - through the lands of the Bonedancers their robed figures danced forth, echoing the enchanting, enthralling melody of their prophet, their messiah and king.\n\nNo, he is not vicious, nor is he in the least demented. His mind is a wonder chamber, from which he can extract treasures that you and I would give years of our life to acquire.\nThe Pallid Mask of Fate has gripped the Bone Dancers, the world will weep when it remembers the truth it has forgotten, the truth of the true Master whom emperors served."
  nf_bonedancers.10.a:0 "At last I was King, King by my right."
  nf_bonedancers.11.t:0 "The Seraph Pilgrims"
  nf_bonedancers.11.d:0 "The "Seraph Pilgrims" have arrived onto the coast of our lands over these recent years with the intent of converting our people to their beliefs. They are bringing a new way of life, a "natural paradise unlike any we have seen". We may have many enemies, but the Seraph Pilgrims - if we listen to what they preach are one of our few alles. In exchange for allowing them to convert some of us to their ways we have provided the Seraphs with a permanent home on our shores. Recently, our leader [BDT.GetLeader] has taken an interest in the religious preachings of the Seraph Pilgrims. He says they only seek to spread what they themselves have chosen, and that what they preach, inherently has some strength. With Cranium converted the leader of the Seraph Pilgrims, a former Seraphine Crusader of Heaven’s Gate named Cain has risen to a role of prominence within the Bone Dancers."
  nf_bonedancers.11.a:0 "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God!"
  nf_bonedancers.12.t:0 "Question of the Soulless"
  nf_bonedancers.12.d:0 "Recently, the Seraph Pilgrims have reached a crisis of faith. How do we settle the issue of automated labor? Some feel that soulless creations shouldn't work alongside man, others feel that they are but a tool and if they are truly sinful that god would have never given us the ability to make such things. It is a thorny topic that has filled the ranks of the Seraph and they are contemplating the best way forward.The leader of the Seraph Pilgrims, Cain has gathered some Seraph elders and has addressed their dilemma in a few words."

  nf_bonedancers.13.t:0 "Question of the Sinners"
  nf_bonedancers.13.d:0 "Recently, the Seraph Pilgrims have reached a crisis of faith. How do we settle the issue of sinners among the flock? Some feel that sinners should be crucified and that their sin will spread to others, others feel that ultimately the God of Steam is a merciful god to those that open their hearts to him.\nIn truth, neither approach is right or wrong. The Gospel can only tell us what is. The Son of Steam told us that "they were all alike, but each had his own gift from God" (Lk 5:29). We must choose one path and make the most of it."
  nf_bonedancers.13.a:0 "John 1:9, forgiveness is good."
  nf_bonedancers.13.b:0 "Psalm 1:1, the way of the sinners is wrong."
  nf_bonedancers.14.t:0 "The Pilgrims Wish for Communion"
  nf_bonedancers.14.d:0 "Recently, the Seraphine Pilgrims - the "Seraph Lords" have asked that we bring them back into the flock. On the coasts to the west they have built a small nation for themselves, converting the local Bonedancers to have the "one Faith" with us. However, many in our clergy feel that the Bonedancers inherently are too cruel to ever be converted truthfully - that they are merely lying for the wealth of Steam. At the moment we are meeting to make decisions, and to form plans of action in regards to this matter."

  nf_bonedancers.15.d:0 "And so the Archangel Micheal came down to our lands, pleased. He lifted his hand, and then spoke these sacred words.\n\n"Come, my disciples, taste the forbidden fruit. You will be but children to me."\n\nLike a garden in bloom he sent forth his servants and made their journey as if to teach us of his wonderful works and triumphs. We had arrived upon a large plain in an open, shady marsh, where all about were gardens of blossoming nature.\n\n"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of Steam."\nMicheal replied, happy with our progress and faith in the Steam."
  nf_bonedancers.15.a:0 "Peace with God."
  nf_bonedancers.16.t:0 "Calls of Heresy!"
  nf_bonedancers.16.d:0 "The Elders of Heaven’s Gate have refused our visits, we have been deemed as heretics! They cannot excommunicate us like this, we must go to them and prove to them our faith - by force, if need be!\nSome might even say that they made us a living wage to become martyrs!"
  nf_bonedancers.16.a:0 "They will feel the wrath of God!"
  nf_bonedancers.17.t:0 "A Trade Offer?"
  nf_bonedancers.17.d:0 "A group of merchants from the south have given us an offer to buy our coastline for a tidy profit. Some in our nation feel that this would be giving up too much - others fear that if we turn this deal down we might be forced into war. The former is peace, the latter will lead to assured war. Which do we choose?"
  nf_bonedancers.17.a:0 "To avoid war this seems worth it."
  nf_bonedancers.17.b:0 "We will never give a inch!"
  nf_bonedancers.18.t:0 "They took the offer!"
  nf_bonedancers.18.d:0 "Already they have moved out of their old lands and we have moved in, now we have a coastline from which we can wage war with Heaven’s Gate!"
  nf_bonedancers.18.a:0 "We can now focus on the heretics!"
  nf_bonedancers.19.t:0 "They refused us!"
  nf_bonedancers.19.d:0 "They seem to be wishing to declare war on us! We will show them for thinking that they can deny us our retribution!"
