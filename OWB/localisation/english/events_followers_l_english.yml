  followers.1.t:0 "The 'Followers of the Apocalypse'"
  followers.1.d:0 "Following their recent establishment in our neighbouring rivals, a group of humanitarian pacifists who dub themselves the 'Followers of the Apocalypse' have begun trickling into our lands. Their aim is seemingly noble: to provide services to those in need, ranging from medical care to agricultural advice. They care for the parts of society we prefer to forget, be them homeless or junkies, and are accepting of all that have no one left to turn to. On this front alone, we have no qualms with them: after all, who would refuse free medical supplies? \n\nProblems only start to arise when you look closely at our neighbors, where the Followers have been established for a while. Support for any sort of war amongst the people of these nations is slipping, as they prefer to stay on their farmsteads and practice their new medicines. There's even some indication that the Followers accept seditious anarchists into their ranks, who are intent on either burning our nation to the ground, or seizing power themselves. We may need to keep an eye on them, therefore, if we decide to tolerate the followers remaining in our land... \n\nOnce established in a nation, the Followers appear very difficult to uproot. We must therefore decide swiftly, before they have a chance to settle down properly, whether or not we should welcome these Followers of the Apocalypse and their strange beliefs into our lands. Accepting them will undoubtedly bring benefit, but at what long-term cost?"
  followers.1.a:0 "Let them come, they'll do only good."
  followers.1.b:0 "It would be best to keep these anarchists from our lands!"
  followers.1.c:0 "They can't do that! Shoot them... or something!"
  followers.2.t:0 "The Followers Establish Themselves"
  followers.2.d:0 "Having failed to work out that we were behind efforts to take advantage of them, the Followers of the Apocalypse have finally spread completely through our nation. They now occupy a number of forts, towers and bases across the country, using them as medical centres and knowledge hubs to assist local populations. Sure enough, populations are expanding, as babies and battle-wounded alike are nurtured back to health by these eerie doctors. Local farmers are also growing bumper crops, thanks to the expansive agricultural knowledge the Followers seem to possess. \n\nWith these benefits come drawbacks, however, and slowly but surely the Followers' ideals are seeping out into the settlements they assist. More and more young men are laying down their arms, seeing agriculture as a more profitable enterprise. Young children are being taught basic medicine. All those who gain some knowledge from the Followers remember their debts, and as a result the influence of the Followers is gradually increasing. We should be able to hold this at bay and still reap reward from the Followers' presence, but we must be wary..."
  followers.2.a:0 "Our relationship with the Followers will be mutually beneficial!"
  followers.3.t:0 "The Followers Reach the Capital"
  followers.3.d:0 "The first trickle of the Followers into our nation was tentative. Probing. They were feeling out our response to them, weighing up if our people were worth the risk. Sure enough, they haven't been met by open bloodshed, and so they've now become emboldened to move into our capital. It has greatly pleased our workers and scavengers, but has irked the aristocracy to no end. Only their children should have the education the Followers grant to all! But even they are beginning to come around to the Followers' presence: their medicine is saving lives, after all."
  followers.3.a:0 "The Followers are not settled. Not yet."
  followers.4.t:0 "The Followers Rejected"
  followers.4.d:0 "Having worked out we have been behind successive attempts to undermine their influence and steal their supplies, the Followers of the Apocalypse have finally grown tired of our antics and left our lands. Whilst they're still happy to tend to our civilians in bases set up around the border, they refuse to step foot inside our nation in protest. We say good riddance! Their anarchist kind have no business here except attempting to overthrow us. Our people are somewhat annoyed at our choice of action, but at least they'll no longer be swayed by Follower propaganda!"
  followers.4.a:0 "We did well."
  followers.5.t:0 "The Followers' Influence Grows Unchecked"
  followers.5.d:0 "Over recent days and months, the Followers' influence has grown to newfound heights. Whilst they already enjoyed reasonable influence over the people they cared for and taught, the tendrils of their power have slowly grasped even our upper echelons. Influential families owe the lives of their children to these pacifist miracle workers, and many brahmin 'barons' have seen bumper seasons after following Followers' advice. Our people, no matter their status, are honest: they will always repay their debts. Recently, worryingly, the Followers have begun calling in these debts in unprecedented numbers. No longer are they lobbying for peace or demilitarization, but now they seem to be getting ready to take positions of power away from loyalists. The Followers are obviously evasive when confronted, with most seemingly having no knowledge of these activities, but we've long suspected a small group of anarchists are embedded withing the Followers... \n\nSure, this could be nothing, but are we really prepared to take the risk?"
  followers.5.a:0 "We must act quickly..."
  followers.6.t:0 "The Followers' Raid on Armageddon Station"
  followers.6.d:0 "Enraged by our refusal to dispose of our new nuclear weapon, a group of fanatic Followers of the Apocalypse have launched a raid on Armageddon Station, the site where our new nuclear weapon is housed. Armed to the teeth, these Followers seem to have completely forgotten about their pacifist philosophy, and are fighting through our defences as we speak. \n\nAll Followers sources we have reached out to in an attempt to explain the raid have firmly denounced the actions of these radicals, but have implored us to exercise restraint against their fellow members. Is there time for such caution when our most prized weapon is a stake?"
  followers.6.a:0 "Crush them. All of them."
  followers.6.b:0 "This is most unlike the Followers!"
  followers_successful_disarm_tt:0 "the Followers §Ysuccessfully§! disarming our bomb."
  followers_unfortunate_accident_tt:0 "a §Rdevastating accident!§!"
  followers_put_down_raid_tt:0 "the raid being §Gput down§! in time."
  followers_encouraged_tt:0 "§YWe allow the Followers of the Apocalypse to settle in our lands without impudence.\n\nThe Followers are a group that will allow us to use special powerful decisions to gain certain benefits. However, if we are cruel, wicked and bloodthirsty they might have demands of their own to make on us!§!"
  followers_discourage_tt:0 "§YUnlock a series of§! §Rhostile decisions§! §Ywe can take against the Followers of the Apocalypse to try to keep them from settling in our lands.§!\n\n"
  followers_fight_off_tt:0 "§YOur people are so violent that we can simply scare away the Followers from even approaching our lands§!"
  followers_need_to_do_negative_actions:0 "§YWe need to suitably discourage the Followers of the Apocalypse from settling in our land by taking decisions to annoy them.§!\n§gThe Followers will otherwise establish themselves, and be impossible to uproot!§!\n"
