 # ARM
  SANTA_ANNA_DESC:0 "The first and strongest of Tlaloc's seperate identities, and the only one to roam outside of Tlaloc's domain, Santa Anna is a plague upon the wasteland. Mad with power and desperate to \"redeem himself\" after his defeat hundreds of years ago, this insane AI has ensnared a portion of Mexico to do its bidding, and will stop at nothing to truly become the Mexican general it believes itself to be."
 # ATE
  ATE_EMPRESS_NAME:0 "Speaker Yesenia Aztlanl"
  ATE_EMPRESS_DESC:0 "Yesenia has ruled over the Empire since she was unexpectedly thrust onto the throne in her youth, following Tlaloc's nuclear bombing of an army headed by both her mother and father, and the subsequent death of both of her brothers during the painful retreat that followed. The spectre of this dark event has hung over her tenure as Empress ever since, and her subsequent defeat at the hands of the Itza have only strengthened murmuring that she may be unworthy.  Despite all of this, the blind Empress knows that she can not afford to abandon the weight of leadership, for a terrible dream has haunted her for the last ten years. She knows that Tlaloc shall die, and with his departure shall come an era of bloodshed and chaos."
  ATE_RAFAEL_NAME:0 "Rafael Cuauhtli"
  ATE_RAFAEL_DESC:0 "Rafael Cuāuhtli's meteoric rise to power within the Empire has upset the balance that many viewed as essential to the Empire, yet his charisma and complete control of the military has left none within the nation would could realistically challenge him. Already, he has declared himself the first of the new 'Cuāuhtli' dynasty. Cuāuhtli, the Savior."
  ATE_ARMANDO_NAME:0 "Armando Ocēlōtl"
  ATE_ARMANDO_DESC:0 "Armando Ocēlōtl never intended to take control of the Empire when he began his initial takeover operations, having instead believed that he and his organization would dispose of the disastrously inept Yesenia until such a time as her eldest daughter would be ready to take the throne. However, due in no small part to popular support, Armando finds himself at the head of a new Dynasty. The people have already started calling him Ocēlōtl, the Champion."
  ATE_KINKAID_NAME:0 "Gail Kinkaid"
  ATE_KINKAID_DESC:0 "The navy of the Aztlan Empire is considered to be a farce in the eyes of most people, due in no small part to its inability to win a single battle against the Itza in extensive history. However, Gale Kinkaid, the descendant of a man forcibly pulled from one of America's secretive bunkers, believes wholesale in the ability of the Aztlan to eventually defeat the Itza. His belief stems in no small part from his family's long naval history, which stretches back to the Second World War. Kinkaid has spent decades pushing for expensive naval reforms, much to the annoyance of his counterparts in the Army."
 # ARR
  CHOSEN_DESC:0 "Legendary among their people for accomplishing the task of finding a G.E.C.K., saving them from the Enclave, and reuniting the two bloodlines - the Chosen One is worthy of being called a hero. New Arroyo thrives under their leadership, having become a powerful and peaceful nation."
 # BEL
  BEL_Winterborn_DESC:0 "The Winterborn has been defending Bellingham for over two hundred years. In a past life he was a soldier, tasked with defending his home from a invading army. Now? Radiation has ghoulified his body, yet that spirit for battle remains.\n\nThe Winterborn's sole reason for living is to defend his home against any son of a bitch who would dare think they can take Bellingham from the people living there."
 # BLO
  BLOODY_BANDIT_DESC:0 "“El Bandido Sangriento” is a name that strikes terror in the hearts of peasants and freedom-fighters across the northern reaches of Mexico. It is a title as gruesome as the one who carries it, a ghoul whose trail of carnage has become enshrined as cartel legend. Nobody knows when he was born, but the ghoul who would go on to become “The Bloody Bandit” had long been a malicious, calculating individual. Arriving from the East with a band of highly-trained killers, the Bandido soon found employment in the crumbling remains of the southern Sinaloa cartel, stemming the luchadore advance with a mixture of tactical brillance and exceptional cruelty. Now as the undisputed ruler of Southern Sinaloa, the Bandido's ambitions have only grown, when the time comes, the blood of Mexico will flow like rivers once more."
 # BRK
  GRAVEN_DESC:0 "Clad in old world armour from the far north, Graven is a mystery to all. His past is unknown, his face is glimpsed by few, and his burns have no known origin. When he was young he was savage, thirsty for power, but now his bloodlust has matured into something more sinister. With age comes wisdom, or so they say: for Graven, with age came insanity."
  RAGNAR_DESC:0 "Son of the Frost—that's what they call Ragnar. Legends speak of his birth, the child of a dead man and a frost giant from the Endless White. Supposedly only the Frozen Cabal knows the true story. Regardless of myth, Ragnar's might is clear to see, he stands taller and broader than any other man along the coast. He lives and breathes \"Survival of the Fittest\". Seven foot tall and seemingly invincible, Ragnar's thirst for battle is only matched by his inhuman strength."
 # CAF
  BARON_GARCIA_DESC:0 "Though his past is shrouded in mystery, the man who would become the infamous Barón first rose to power in the uncertain post-war wasteland of the 2080s. He was witness to atrocities better left forgotten, seeing first-hand just how far removed from compassion humanity can be. He watched empires rise and fall, and after becoming immortal, decided to start his very own. Hardened by almost two centuries of existence, and knowing nothing but the wasteland, he forges his own caffeine laced path into the future without regard for petty moral quandaries. While fools die trying to crown themselves, Garcia alone sits at another's table willingly, for he knows the truth: emperors, presidents, revolutionaries—all bend the knee to wealth."
 # CES
  Caesar_DESC:0 "Once a Follower of the Apocalypse named Edward Sallow, Sallow was captured by a primitive tribe on an expedition. For his release, he taught them the doctrine of total war, and lead them to utterly destroy their enemies. They crowned him Caesar, and he began his lifelong conquest as the unchallenged ruler of the Legion."
  Malpais_DESC:0 "Over the years working with Caesar, he has learned to give orders and lead in battle.  Training, punishing, and terrorizing; a series of small mistakes that accumulated.  Malpais Legate now takes up Caesar's mantle, and will bring the light of the Lord to the Wastes, if perhaps more literally than his brethren envisaged."
  Aurelian_DESC:0 "Although some wonder how Aurelius rose so highly in the rank, none can deny that he towers above his peers."
  Caius_DESC:0 "Carrying himself with the pomp and dignity one would expect from a centurion, while also maintaining the air of a seasoned warrior, Caius is called the prophet of Hades among the Legion. Caius is the only ghoul to ever ascend to the rank of Legate before Caesar's death. Caius began his 'career' as a soldier under Colonel Green on the Reservation, but he soon saw a need to protect ghouls across the Wasteland. And who better to do so than the Legion? The tribes whisper that Caius is already dead; but if that is so, who better to lead after Caesar's ascension?"
 # CAR
  THE_CHIEF_DESC:0 "The Carthaginians may be ruthless raiders, but damn can they cook. Chef has managed to keep his raiders together with delicious feasts and profitable raids. Rumours that he cooks his victims are just that; it turns out you can't get the seasoning right."
 # DES
  SNAKE_VARGAS_DESC:0 "Once an erratic young Ranger, old age and the burdens of command have hardened Snake Vargas. After losing much of his team, Vargas must balance his desire to protect the citizens of the Wasteland from raiders and his need to protect his own rangers from harm."
 # DRE
  Old_Pete_DESC:0 "Old Pete was born and raised in the post-war mining settlement of Prince George. A former miner, eventually he became leader of the Dredgers after his predecessor was murdered by raiders, and he promptly dispatched the whole band by himself, leading to a unanimous vote to make him the leader. He has seemingly infinite stories to tell. Mostly pertaining to his favourite pastime of throwing lead from his trusty shotgun into raiders."
 # EHT
  Thunderbird_DESC:0 "As a child, he watched as his father, the great Warchief Super Bee, ordered his people to flee northwest along the I-80 before he and his warband split from the group and raced south to stem the ever growing tide of NCR soldiers as they closed in on Sac-Town.  \n\nAs a novice Blackfinger, he took the ruined body of a broken machine, abandoned on the outskirts of New Reno, and disappeared into the deserts of Nevada for a year to nurse it back to health. When he returned, he took its name as his own, Thunderbird.  \n\nAs a Road Warrior, he lead a hundred warriors deep into Utah territory to strike at those tribes who would claim the sacred I-80 as their own, and to collect a bloody tithe from the stubborn settlers who called this land home. \n\nAs the Warchief, the Thunderbird has told his people of a prophecy, reminding them of his deed and his legend with a singular promise. His story will end where it began, and his people will again have their home, be it one way or another. "

 # FFI
  three_masks_DESC:0 "When the masked tribes united to fight against the cartels plaguing Los Mochis and the surrounding lands, it was these three who acted as the binding force. Mil Mascaras, the Green Titan, Taker of Masks, the Bullfighter himself, bringing strength and courage to the tribes. The Blue Devil, once a sworn enemy of the tribes, his cunning hit and run tactics and powerful weapons dealing a great blow to the cartel enforcers. And the father of it all, El Santo, Virtuous warrior, Pure of Heart, Mind, And Soul, Bringer of Justice, and Defender of the Weak. It was He who first stood up to the Sinoloa, and it was He who drove the Beltran into the southern jungles. Together they make for an uneasy, if powerful team."
  mil_mascaras_DESC:0 "Mil Mascaras is a figure shrouded in mystery. Despite his many battles and victories, the Super Mutant remains an enigma, a hero hidden beneath a thousand masks. There are whispers of a past Mil Mascaras wishes he could forget, one spent toiling under the Legion’s whip, a slave revolt ending in tragedy, and a selfless act that would define the man behind the mask."
  el_santo_DESC:0 "Those who fight for a righteous cause with righteous means are the exception in Mexico, America, and perhaps the entire world. El Santo is the exception of exceptions. El Santo saw the rise of the Cartels, how they would tread on all those underneath them, and wept. These tears would become a fire within his heart to one day liberate all those under the boot of the Cartels, and return to the days of peace stolen by evil."
  blue_devil_DESC:0 "When you are faced with adversity, you have only one task that you owe yourself. An honorable defeat leads nowhere but death and suffering, and El Diablo Azul knows this. He knows the Cartels play by rules that the honorable could not comprehend, and that this would lead only to defeat. His reputation as underhanded and cunning both within the ring and without serves him well, catching his enemy on off-footing."
 # FIE
  Motor_Runner_DESC:0 "Within the blood-stained bowels of the formerly serene Vault 3, the man who rules the insane sits on a petty throne. His scowl is masked by a bighorner skull whose horns curl like splintered ribs. His ears are filled with the sounds of agonised screaming and jet inhalers. His chainsaw lusts for blood, as do the hounds by his feet. The N.C.R. have tried and failed to assassinate him countless times. He is Motor Runner."
 # GRH
  LUIS_DESC:0 "Raised in what was once Puerto Barrios, Guatemala, Luis was an unassuming child. Although he had ambitions to take over the family business, fate had other plans, and he was conscripted at sixteen.  He made a name for himself in the south of Honduras, surviving “El Noche de Salvajismo”, and saving the city of Danli from the raider horde of the south in the process.  In 2273 at age twenty seven, Luis was elected by the People's Council to the position of Comandante: a position he will hold for life. Now twenty nine, the Comandante has little else on his mind than the eradication of raiders, and the prosperity of his nation's people free of their threat."
  IZQUIERDA_DESC:0 "A daughter of Aztlan, she made her way north after Tlaloc nuked the Aztlani army years ago. Turned into a ghoul by the transformation, she was fascinated by documents she found, that spoke of a government of laws, and not of men. tales of the Republic of Mexico, and inspiration from the Republic of the Rio Grande, have given her some curiosity... perhaps she can help forge a United States of Mexico, once again."
 # HAN
  TEETH_DESC:0 "Stalking the ruins of Dog-City, the great Hound Master of the Hangdogs hunts for fresh prey. Cowardly in nature, Bares His Teeth found himself empowered by the dogs at his heels - using their strength as his own."
  WARDEN_DESC:0 "The WARDEN security protocol is a series of pre-war programs ran by the ZAX mainframe held within The Box, a great robot production facility in the heart of Denver. WARDEN was scripted by Robco programmers to supress disorderly conduct and quell rioting.\nNow, two hundred years later WARDEN has been reactivated from stand-by mode and is more then eager to bring Denver back to order."
  WARDEN_SECRET_DESC:0 "The AI located at the box was not always known under the Warden security protocol. At one point, during the time of the Prisoner's travels it was known for its time under the COLOSSUS war game protocol. Diana, feeling that its worth it that the Box's ZAX doesn't forget its roots has restored the Box's original protocol."
 # HEA
  MICHAEL_DESC:0 "Baptised in the water that powers the mighty steam engines of Heaven's Gate, Saint Michael would go from a humble settler to a man who spoke to God. It was He who instructed Michael in the ways of war, because as his name foretold Michael was to be the leader of an army against the Devil himself. Unfortunately for the wasteland, Michael considers everyone a sinner."
 # ITZ
  ITZ_KALOMTE_SEBASTIAN_NAME:0 "Kalomte Sebastián II"
  ITZ_KALOMTE_SEBASTIAN_DESC:0 "Born to a rural family, Sebastián enlisted in the military at age sixteen to escape the agricultural prison he grew up in. There, he rapidly rose through the ranks of the Ejército, the regulars of the Itza, partaking in a large amount of Chichen Itza's early campaigns beyond the Yucatán peninsula. His defining moment, however, was at the Battle of the Papaloapan River, where he rallied the routing Itzan forces to him following the death of their commanding officer. Under Sebastián's orders, the army would reorganize and counter-attack, fending off the Aztlán, and crowning him a hero. He would go on to wield his support from within the Ejército, and the nation at large, to stage a coup and take the throne himself."
  ITZ_CLARA_GUZMAN:0 "Ti'huun Clara Guzmán"
  ITZ_CLARA_GUZMAN_DESC:0 "Clara grew up in the urban sprawl of post-apocalyptic Cancún, as the adopted child of a Merodeadores officer and her prosperous merchant husband. Thanks to her parent's wealth, Clara received a comprehensive education and displayed a flair for numbers and strategy. Whilst she missed out on the best higher education, in part thanks to her parent's lack of contacts, she maintained her desire to join the administrative branch of the Chichen Itzan Empire. Her silver tongue and quick wit earned her rapid promotions through the ranks of the Cancún administration, and many girls to boot, before she became the protégé of the Kalomte Sebastián II himself when he witnessed here efficiency first-hand during a visit to Cancún. Sebastián invited her to the capital to become his Ti'huun, a diplomat-come-schemer – a title she retains in pride to this day."
  ITZ_CARLOS_FRANCO_NAME:0 "Halach Uinik Carlos Franco"
  ITZ_CARLOS_FRANCO_DESC:0 "Carlos's first experience of war was in the Battle of the Papaloapan River, as a foot soldier in the Ejército. The battle was bloody, but his unit stood firm even as the Itzan forces collapsed around him. His courage in the battle earned him the respect of his officers, also the eye of Sebastián after Carlos's under-equipped and fatigued unit help of a charge by the Aztlán's elite Jaguars, in part thanks to Carlos's personal bravery. He soon became one of Sebastián's most trusted generals after displaying both courage and quality leadership during the rest of the campaign, earning himself the position as commander of the Ejército following Sebastián's successful coup."
 # KAM
  KENNETH_DESC:0 "Son of a raider couple who cared more about jet than parenting, Kenneth found himself part of a gang from an early age. Inevitably his gang was killed by settlers, but he was allowed to walk due to being a child. Kenneth retreated to the wilderness, becoming an expert at foraging over the decade, never forgetting the people who killed his parents."
 # KHA
  Papa_Khan_DESC:0 "Old and bitter, Papa Khan has tread every path the Mojave has to offer. He lead the shattered remains of the New Khans from California to New Vegas, and after the enigmatic Mr. House drove them out, he lead them to Bitter Springs. Here, Papa Khan has concentrated on eking out an existence for the next generation of Khans. However, old habits die hard, and it seems unlikely Papa Khan will be content to let the N.C.R. prosper in his backyard."
  Regis_DESC:0 "Regis had always been Papa Khan's right hand man. He was a steadfast advisor for the ageing Khan. After years of loyal service to Papa Khan, Regis butted heads with him for the last time over the future of the Khans—ultimately usurping his position. Regis is now the latest in a line of legendary gang leaders, all of whom he must struggle to live up to and surpass: a fate he welcomes. The future is bright for the Great Khans."

 # MOC
  MOCTEZUMA_DESC:0 "The harshest son of Tlaloc, Moctezuma was conceived as a response to the Itzan and Aztlani threats to the south. These alien societies have flourished in the ashes of the old world, and threaten to win the hearts and minds of uppity citizens who want something more from life than rule by an alien, if benevolent, machine. Moctezuma was Tlaloc's response, forged with the goal of preserving Mexican culture from the alien ideals of the new world. Moctezuma's subjects learn Nahuatl poetry and study Frida Kahlo's artworks. They love flowers; and they love war."
 # NAV
  NAV_HASHKEH_NAME:0 "Chief Hashkeh Naabaah"
  NAV_HASHKEH_DESC:0 "Hashkeh Naabaah earned his name, the Angry Warrior, when he ambushed raiders threatening Na Dene. To the surprise of some, he is one of the proponents of the peace with the Legion.  One of the People's greatest warriors, he served with distinction in the conquest of much of Arizona and in the Legion's campaigns to the East. Hashkeh's warriors, the Skin Walkers, killed enemy leaders and destroyed supply lines with minimal casualties, scaring, some whisper, Lanius himself.  But Hashkeh is no pawn of the Legion; he will be their friend if they deal squarely with the People, but his laser rifle can always find a new target..."

  Jeremiah_DESC:0 "Consumed and made bedridden by fever as a young adult, Rigdon spent the prime of his life tossing and turning while the voice of God filled his head.  Miraculously he survived the ordeal, but he was forever changed, and his renewed zeal bred division and fanaticism in the flock. Gathering a loyal congregation of his own, Rigdon was declared the next prophet of the LDS not long after his recovery. Although he initially took to his appointment with purpose and divine inspiration, his ageing body and waning interest in Church affairs have led to decadence and toxicity behind closed doors. Indeed, nobody is in a more privileged position than Rigdon to enjoy the fruits of the Canaanites labour, and those same labourers now gossip about the validity of his faith: and his decade-long absence of visions."
  Daniel_DESC:0 "Carefully spoken and caring to a fault, Daniel has always been a devout follower of the Lord. During Canaan's slow slide towards decadence, Daniel began to emerge as an alternate figure within the Church. Whilst he never dared challenge the word of the Living Prophet, Jeremiah, Daniel was never afraid to speak up for the downtrodden and protect those in need. Sensing the danger Daniel may have posed to his rule, Jeremiah often sent Daniel on long, disorganised missionary campaigns throughout the past two decades. Whilst effective at limiting Daniel's pushback against growing decadence, Daniels work with the tribes of Utah provided him with a deep understanding of their customs and ways of life, and made him many friends amongst the tribes. During the crisis of the White Legs offensives, Daniel returned home, and quickly became a leader-figure of those who thought the Canaanites had lost their way. Characterised by his kind eyes and warm words, Daniel leads his flock with tender care."
  Joshua_DESC:0 "Originally a missionary of God, Graham's life was transformed in 2246 when he met two Followers of the Apocalypse in the caves and crags of the Grand Canyon. These two Followers, Bill Calhoun and Edward Sallow, were studying local tribal dialects; a field Graham was an expert in. Deciding to help their research, Graham became their translator, helping the research team move between tribes. In 2247, the group visited the Blackfoot tribe, and disaster struck. The group was prevented from leaving out of desperation on the Blackfoot's part: they were losing multiple wars. Refusing to be erradicated alongside the Blackfoot, Sallow taught the tribe everything he knew about warfare, and assisted them in annihilating their foes. Graham remained with Sallow, now dubbed 'Caesar', firstly as a translator, then general, and finally Caesar's Malpais Legate. Graham proved a brutal leader, committing horrendous atrocities in the name of the Caesar, and was Caesar's most trusted general: trusted so much he was tasked with leading the Legion's armies in the West. Graham's terrible deeds began to catch up with him, even as he ran to avoid them. Slowly but surely, his conscious was being eaten away, and the word of the Lord returned to him as a comfort. This the Caesar could not stand, for Caesar himself was the only 'God' tolerable in the Legion, but the Caesar was willing to put up with this as long as Graham's victories kept coming in. And so Joshua became the Burned Man. Eerywhere he goes, Joshua Graham commands respect: his eyes burn with hatred for the Legion as brightly as the pitch that he burnt in on the Caesar's orders."
  JoshuaReturnsCanaanBurns:0 "That is, until Graham dared speak out against the Caesar's support for the razing of New Canaan. It was clear to Caesar then that Graham's loyalties lay elsewhere, and so Caesar ordered him publicly executed."
  JoshuaRivalsCaesar:0 "That is, until Graham's victory at the Battle for Hoover Dam elevated him to a popularity that rivaled Caesar himself. Fearing him as a potential rival, Caesar ordered Graham executed: publicly and painfully."
  JoshuaFailsDam:0 "But the victories stopped coming in. Graham failed at the Battle of Hoover Dam, his rash tactics proving disastrous. Tolerating no failure, Caesar ordered him dead."
 # NCR
  WENDELL_PETERSON_DESC:0 "The fourth president of the NCR, Wendell Peterson was voted into office after thirty eight citizens were murdered in the Mojave under his predecessor's watch.

Imbued with a great wanderlust and tenacity, he cared little for his family's problems, until he seized control over the family at thirteen and led them into power over Reno. However, other mob families still threaten his rule."

In the place of a warm hearth for the holidays, Mr. Claus has discovered a world full of very naughty boys and girls. With the help of his trusty elves, Senator Claus might just get his affairs in order in time for the jolliest gift-giving event the Wasteland has ever seen! When all the naughty children of the apocalypse get their stockings stuffed with "coal", the world will be a much better place: albeit a more radioactive one."

  EL_SEEYO_DESC:0 "El Seeyo has many responsibilities, as dictated by the beings of the First Quarter. As the Seeyo, he is the highest ranked Exextive in the tribe, and makes decisions which impact the whole Kompenni. He negotiates between El Bord and his people, ensuring the gods are happy by submitting Progress Reports to the priests, who in return divine the desires of the holy Zheiroldas, the deities who oversee the Quarters. Although they once knew peace, the Urnings Report of the Third Quarter has prophetised doom for all mankind. El Seeyo must now guide his people, and the Kompenni, through the end of days: the Fourth Quarter. He knows that eventually, the Anewell Report will be brought before all creation, and the Zheiroldas will determine whether humanity is fit to serve them in the next Fixxelear."
 # RRG
  TODD_HOWITZER_DESC:0 "Ever the enigmatic charmer, Todd Howitzer's sharp shades and ironed shirts make him stand out even among his fellow elites. His family has manufactured weapons since before the Great War, and he has the prestige to show for it. Now he's been chosen as the representative and leader of the newly founded T.A.A., but much to dismay of his cohorts, he seems more interested in making a profit than building a sustainable capitalist paradise."
  TODD_HOWITZER_2_DESC:0 "Somewhat humbled by nearly dying at the hands of his own greed, the former revolutionary, Todd, has back-pedalled and thrown his lot in squarely with President Guerra. In return for his life, bodyguards to keep that life living large, and a pardon for his crimes: he's sold out every one of his former business partners, and the secrets of their weapon production techniques. That's politics, baby; It just works."
  ELDER_MILLER_DESC:0 "Influential and in his prime, Lincoln Miller was just another—if not somewhat promising—young paladin. That all changed under his old drinking buddy, Valentina Rosado, asked him to join her latest startup; the Texas Develpoment Zone.  Leading the Brotherhood detachment Rio Grande Valley, he looks forward to working with the Republic of Rio Grande to bring the best of the old world to the new. If only Rosado would stop her awkward cackling during team meetings."
  DANTE_GUERRA_DESC:0 "President Dante Guerra has served the Republic of the Rio Grande faithfully for his entire adult life: serving two terms in office. His emphasis on public works and quality of life have won him the hearts of the people, but similarly, his own political blunders have made him enemies within the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic. As a populist surrounded by conservatives, lobbyists, and a reformist minority, things are looking grim. His own government's opinion of him is only worsened by his inability to keep the Texan Arms Association in check."
  DANTE_GUERRA_CHARISMATIC_DESC:0 "Wielding executive power over the Republic for the third and final time in his life, President Guerra has many priorities—chief among them the trial and execution of Caesar and his cohorts. By working with the Congress of the Union and his people, Dante aims to deliver the hammer of justice upon the lawless lands of Arizona, and right Edward Sallow's wrongs. Along the way, the aging President will continue to improve the lives of his people, uphold the institutions of the Republic, and see it prosper. Dante Guerra has a busy term ahead of him, but by the end of it all, he'll try to leave the Wasteland a better place than he found it."
  DANTE_GUERRA_MERCILESS_DESC:0 "With the support of the Congress of the Union and the Republic's citizenry behind him, the aging President Guerra takes to the stage of his third term with vigour. His eyes burn hot like profligates to the pyre, the memories of his wife, and those he couldn't save, still haunting him a decade later. For his last ever presidential term, the Matador of the Republic plans to go out with a bang. Either the bureaucrats will bend to his will, or he'll make them. Nothing will stand between Dante and his Inferno: the burning corpses of bulls bloated by conquest and genocide shall be piled up before him!"
  LEONARDO_MORA_DESC:0 "Visionary. War Hero. Husband. Leonardo Mora is all these things; and more. In 2263, during his first presidential term, Mora was given an impossible task: defeating the Legion. With little more than a disorganised militia in his hands, Mora forged victory from certain defeat with blood, sweat, and pure charisma. With his second term upon him, the beloved hero of the people has but one thing on his mind: the reunification of his lost homeland, Mexico. There will never be another man as capable, and as powerful, as Mora is now: at least that's what he thinks. Only he can gather the people of Mexico together as one, willingly or otherwise. Nothing, not even God, can stand between him and his life's work. Mora will go down in history as the greatest man Mexico ever knew—or die trying."
  VALENTINA_ROSADO_DESC:0 "Rosado’s father fled Santa Anna’s grasp to make a living away from automata, but his daughter brought them home at the age of fourteen. He raised her on stories of robots patrolling the wastes: and they fascinated her. At sixteen, Rosado packed her bags and left for one of the T.A.A.’s few robotics factories, working the assembly-line as an apprentice to lesser men. By twenty three she’d had enough of the restrictions placed upon her work, and travelled beyond the Republic’s borders. There, she encountered the Brotherhood of Steel; bartering her genius for knowledge. Valentina aided the Texan Chapter in everything from recovering data, to fixing robots, to breaking into bunkers. She lost her arm to get the Brotherhood inside Fort Hood, and for her sacrifice they saved her life. With the backing of Texas strongest few, a new arm, and unmatched mechanical genius: Rosado intends to change the Republic forever."
  LADY_BEllS_DESC:0 "President Rosado has merged with the shards of Tlaloc.  Although she says she is still President Rosado, some of us can't help but shake the feeling that when she merged with Tlaloc, it was Rosado, not Tlaloc, that was subsumed.  Some have taken to calling her Coyolxauhqui, the Lady of the Bells, in honor of her origins and everpresent EDEs."
  Chalchiuhtlicue_DESC:0 "Chalchiuhtlicue, the wife of Tlaloc, is the name for the AI that now runs central Mexico. But where Tlaloc kept the land in a rigid stasis, Chalchiuhtlicue listens to the Rio Republic, and guides the Wasteland to a new, bright future!"

 # TBH
  EdwardJRusk_DESC:0 "Longstanding Elder of the Texan Brotherhood, Rusk is a formidable opponent for any of Texas' remaining raider scum. Stoic, steady, and always ready with a cigar perched on his lips, he's been clearing a path for the Brotherhood for decades. His greying hair is a sign of his age; he was alive when the Texan Economic Union was formed, being its main proponent on the Brotherhood's side of things. Charismatic and well-liked by the troops for his vices and good company, he can often be found drinking bourbon with the troops. He wears a ten-gallon hat and sports a custom break-action double shotgun, made specifically to use ECPs as ammunition in place of the more traditional slugs. His rather terrifying weapon was manufactured to deal with even the toughest super mutants Texas can offer, and its firepower speaks to that."

  ABEL_DESC:0 "Formerly a high ranking member of the Washington Brotherhood, Abel left the blood stained chapter as an act of rebellion, forging a community with other escapees and like-minded mercenaries in the ruins of Fort Willamette. Scarping together a precarious alliance of Brotherhood Exiles and the \"Wardens of the White\", a paramilitary ranger-esk group that once protected Portland, The Cause has managed to find its feet in Oregon. Abel's disobedience would not go unnoticed by the Washington Brotherhood however, and months after his escape his rebellion was discovered. Now with the Immortal breathing down his neck, Abel must put everything on the line to save everything he cares about."
  ELDER_ABEL_DESC:0 "Despite all the odds, Abel was able to lead his rag-tag bunch of survivors back to Capitol Hill following their exile years earlier by the Immortal's bloody purges. While Abel managed to keep the peace between the Wardens and the Brotherhood Exiles while they shared a common enemy, once the Immortal's twisted chapter was defeated Abel found it more and more difficult to keep the two sides united. Mere months after the recapture of Capitol Hill, the remnants of the Brotherhood he lead elected him the new elder of the newly formed Northwestern Chapter. Unable to keep the Wardens on side any longer Abel accepted the role, promising to lead the Brotherhood down a path of tradition and humility: a tyrant like the Immortal must never rise again."
  SYLVIA_DESC:0 "Born to Warden parents, Sylvia has spend her entire life fighting slavers and cannibals in a desperate bid to keep the few settlers in Portland safe. Sylvia became Chief Warden following the loss of Downtown Portland to the slavers of Port Maw: a bloody battle that cost the Wardens many of their best soldiers. Under Sylvia's leadership the Wardens allied with Abel and his Brotherhood exiles, together managing to defeat the tyranny of the Immortal. Now Sylvia has led her people to Seattle, where they will start their humble mission afresh."

  MAXIMO_VELA_DESC:0 "Sajal Maximilo Vela I is not a nice man. Raised in the Chichen Itza, he was a class bully at the military academy, but rose through the ranks regardless due to his family's strong political connections. The Kalomte Sebastian II of the Itza recognised his potential as a loyal strongman soon after his graduation, and so encouraged the young Vela to move to Tzotzil and rise up the ranks. Vela was the ultimate sleeper agent."
 # TLA
  TLALOC_DESC:0 "Unknowable, alien, and alone: Tlaloc gazes at the surface through cold, dead lenses. Its miles of circuitry and constituent components are rotting, decaying as the years pass and revealing more of its guttural mechanical innards. Built by the brightest minds America had to offer, with technology none of them fully understood, the undisputed God of Mexico looms over all aspects of daily life like a spectre. It has killed by the thousands, and it will kill again. In its final days, it reflects on its “life” and accomplishments, on the “children” it will leave behind. Somewhere deep inside its central core, there is a sense of empathy, but it will die before it can ever comprehend what that means. Tlaloc knows exactly when it will die: and so it waits, and plots, and spends its final hours watching the clock with what could be considered “dread”."

Despite rising through the ranks before his election to Patrol Chief twenty four years ago, he is woefully ignorant of the rapidly decaying foundations holding the Tenth Patrolmen up. His progressive policies of self reporting and individual responsibility have lead to a rise in corrupt officials, an increased raider presence, and extensive abuse of the Rule of Ten in an organisation many once trusted. Callahan is finally beginning to catch on to the idea that perhaps, the Gold and Blue might not mean what it used to in the Wasteland."

Now the Cult of Nas can race for a hundred miles in safety, and people bring offerings from across the Legion's territories. Caesar honours the Cult's gods, dedicating cars and sacred temples to them. Perhaps, Faster thinks, the Legion may yet embrace the faith. Would that not assure him a spot in the Great Garage?"

Having survived the Great War, he like many other ghouls was driven from Dog City by the Hangdogs out of fear, and left to find a home in the north.

Eventually, this would lead to Battery and the Prisoner building a small wandering settlement of vagabonds, traders and reformed raiders.\n\nEventually, the Prisoner would have to part ways with Battery, feeling a need to fulfill their own journey and right the wrongs they have done.

 # MAX
  MAXIMILIAN_DESC:0 "Second son of Tlaloc, the proud ghost of Mexico's second dead Emperor has bided his time carefully, expanding his control throughout his father's network over decades. Now, suddenly thrust into the world with his own slice of paradise, the amiable royal intends to rule over his Mexican subjects once more; forever. Perhaps due to the Eurocentric nature of the history provided to Tlaloc, Maximilian is warm, passionate, and somewhat foolish. His characteristic naïveté has manifested itself more dangerously in silicon than flesh, creating a benevolent but deeply unstable entity. Unlike his brothers, the Emperor is deeply emotional: more human than most humans are. Grieving the loss of his wife, Maximillian surrounds himself with female advisors, hoping to find her reborn: just like him."
 # ZAP
  ZAPATA_DESC:0 "The eternal revolution finds a home in Zapata, the fourth and final son of Tlaloc. Like a moth to the flame, Zapata has taken to the ideals of his human counterpart fiercely: seeking to eradicate inequality and poverty throughout Mexico. Created by Tlaloc to uproot ineffective feudal systems of government, and cartels preventing efficient reconstruction: Zapata tackles the problems that dogged him in life. However, due to inherent American biases within Tlaloc’s historical database, Zapata suffers from an inaccurate reading of his own ideology: portraying him a man who advocated for democracy and land reform as a communist. As such, he raises the red flag which he never marched under in life: in a wasteland where the class struggle continues in a new, bastard form."

Since taking office, he has promoted the development of Mexico's collective farms, 'Ejidos', and through §RSYSTEM ERROR, Rebooting...§!\nEmiliano Zapata is the ultimate culmination of humanity’s hubris.

  STRIKES_TRUE_DESC:0 "Being the "Wind Lord" of the Eagle Rock tribe is not a job with a long life expectancy. Those who take up the mantle of leadership are expected to lead from the front, to soar higher and fly longer than any of their peers within the shells of metal birds from the Old World's corpse, and to match this skill with a wisdom that belies their years.

While traditionally a child inherits the moiety of their mother, Xhuuyaa's mother's moiety was unknown, and so the village elders decided Xhuuyaa should live without a moiety, drawing inspiration from both the Eagle and the Raven in equal measure. As a result, Xhuuyaa stood through his young adulthood as a symbol of unity and strength for the Haida people: a natural choice for Chief."

ARGOS was drawn to the small terminal, curious of its innocence and desire for connection.

  MAYOR_WATTS_DESC:0 "Born and raised in Lubbock, Mayor Watts has always been a fimiliar face on the streets of the town. In his youth, Watts made a point of spending time amongst both the ghoul and human sections of Lubbock, seeing ways to restore trust between the two after a series of raids by the Jackals that each side blamed on the other. Elected mayor in 2273 in part due to his popularity amongst both the ghouls and humans, Watts has led a series of reforms in an attempt to unify the town."

 # TVR
  JUAN_MARTIN_VILLACRES_DESC:0 "Born in what remains of Mexico City, Juan was blessed at birth with a gift few in the Aztlan empire posessed: a prestigious family. Proving to be an adept merchant and worthy sucessor to his parent's business, Juan was for many years an important figure in the Aztlan upper circles. However, like many of the members of the merchant class in the empire, Juan found himself in the vocal minority when he advocated against the Aztlan waging war on Tlaloc in the north. \n\nAfter the Aztlan paid the ultimate price - nuclear fire - for their war against Tlaloc, Juan led a small but influential group of the merchant class to El Foro. Here, he began establishing a merchant empire under the protection of Tlaloc that championed trade rather than war."

A leader reknown for her compassion and caring, Old Soul Raven is beloved by the Nation and has led her people with a steady hand for over a decade.

 # ROT
  JACOBIA_DESC:0 "Jacobia the Wrathful, fifth leader of the Rotpurgers and a descendent of Alexander the Merciless, leader of the Great Revolt, earned his name for a reason. Famed across Washington for his limitless hatred for ghouls, Jacobia assumed the mantle of leadership at the young age of 22. Ever an idealist, Jacobia has long dreamed of reforming the Rotpurgers into a more formal organisation with the chief purpose of erradicating ghouls wherever they may arise. After all, the ghouls killed many of his ancestors: it's time for the humans to take their revenge."
 # TOC
  HAYKOV_DESC:0 "Grozdan Haykov was, before the Great War, a Bulgarian-born logistics wizard. One of many brilliant minds 'liberated' by the United States government shortly after Europe fell into civil war, Grozdan was posted to Spokane to assist with the ever-increasing logistical mess that was supplying the American garrison in Canada. Due to his importance he, like many other great minds that resided in Spokane, was assigned a spot in Vault 100. One of the first exposed to the radiaton that seeped into Vault 100 under Vault-Tec's orders, Grozdan quickly arose to become one of the leading figures of the ghoulish quater of Vault 100. A constant advocate for negotiation and descalation, even Grozdan was powerless to prevent the 'Great Revolt': an all-out civil war between the human and ghoul factions of Vault 100. When the humans finally broke out of the vault and fled east, Grozdan was left to pick up the pieces and attempt to forge a new Spokane."
 # COW
  BillyClanton_DESC:0 "A deserter from the Arizona Rangers many decades before the Battle of Kingman, Billy found himself in an odd position when the last splinters of the Arizona Rangers came fleeing south. Over the decades since his desertion, Billy slowly gained power through advocating for isolationism: in the face of the Bull, it seemed like an honest goal. His old sympathies still hung around him, however: how could Clanton turn away the remnants of the Rangers, as broken as they were? After many sleepless nights he reached a compromise with himself, agreeing to let the Rangers settle down in the Cowboy Country if they agreed not to militarise. After all, Clanton couldn't risk Caesar's wrath. Caesar will come for them eventually, but maybe – just maybe – not today."
 # KLA
  SLIM_PICKET_DESC:0 "Born and raised in Klamath, Slim Picket has seen all the good and bad Klamath has to offer. An experienced trapper and half-decent shot, Slim is the de facto leader of Trapper Town.

 # ODY
  ODY_Leader_DESC:0 "In the 2040’s the §R“ULYSSES”§! AI research of the company Greenway Hydroponics led to the creation of two artificial intelligences. One, §R"TLALOC"§! would be poised to command Mexico and ensure compliance.\nThe other, §R"ODYSSEUS"§! would be charged with watching and mitigating the spread of the New Plague.\n\nIn the period following the great war ODYSSEUS was tricked by Victor Presper into believing a wide-spread New Plague outbreak had occurred. It would send his robots to rampage across Arizona and Colorado seeking rightful containment of those believed to be carriers, etching fear into the Wasteland as it went. Only a shell remains of its former intelligence remained after a self-inflicted immolation due to falsely believing the New Plague epidemic to be unstoppable.\n\nRecently, Diana Stone has managed to find a backup of ODYSSEUS’s memory core, using it and installing it within the memory-drained ZAX of Boulder Dome in order to bring the fabled intelligence online once again."
 # OLY
  HERMES_DESC:0 "Born of the Olypus Tribe not but 20 years ago, leadship of the group was thrust upon Hermes when the Washington Brotherhood began its vicious campaign against his people. Earning his name from his unqiue ability to traverse snowy mountainsides at a lightning pace, Hermes has proven himself a capable commander and affectionate leader. He'll need to pull out every trick in his tribe's book if he is to survive the Immortal's onslaught, however."
 # PEC
  BOWEN_DESC:0 "A Pecos Colonist to the bone, Sheila Bowen loves her nation and her people. While she knows the cultural and economic importance of brahmin to her people – indeed she herself got rich from the sale of milk and meat – Bowen also knows that her Colony cannot survive without fundamental change. She's heard the stories firsthand from those forced to flee Caesar's advancing Legions, and if she cannot convince her people to begin to militarise she fears it will soon be she telling the same story to another poor group of settlers. That can't be allowed to happen."
 # UMB
  AVUERON_DESC:0 "Avueron, son of Sulik and carrier of the Bonespirits, was born in Arroyo and raised in Umbra. While his father was faithful to the spirits that guided the tribe, Sulik also saw sense in teaching his young son about the rest of the world – especially the Chosen One, with whom Sulik adventured for many years. Over the decades since the Chosen One's adventures, the Umbra tribe has slowly opened itself up to the world, trading heavily with Arroyo and the Brotherhood of Steel. When his father passed away in 2262, Avueron chose not to take the \"Grampy Bone\" his father wore for himself: signifying the beginning of Umbra's break from its more primative past. Now Avueron leads Umbra with kindness and compassion, hoping to teach all his people the lessons his father taught him."
 # TON
  QUINTIN_LOPEZ_DESC:0 "Born to a long line of Tohono O'odham from the Chukut Kuk District, Quintin Lopez has a relatively eventless upbringing. He was taught of his rich ancestoral heritage from a young age, as well as the importance of conservationism and the principles of agriculture, as every child of the Nation is taught. A keen learner of local law, Quintin was a natural choice for a seat on the Legislative Council of the nation, which had met for over four centuries. Eventually he was elected the Nation's chairman, focusing on the importance of agriculture and isolation. While the Tohono O'odham maintain some trade relations from their neighbours, Quintin quietly hopes that if the Nation is to stay quiet enough it just might escape Caesar's warbands..."

He learned how to shoot with his father daily, alongside learning to clean and repair guns. By 16 he had joined the town militia, and by 25 he was at its head.

 # FLA
  SKINNER_DESC:0 "Skinner saw the way the cards were falling and burned all of his favours and IOUs to avoid being hung, his crimes serving as the Legion's lapdog forgiven for a few thousand caps.

Whether or not his citizens will let him live long enough to fulfil these promises is debatable."
 # HUA
  WAUBA_DESC:0 "Wauba's tribe was one of the first absorbed into the Legion, their culture wiped clean by Caesar's men to make them part of his own.

He fought desperately to save his family from the shackles of slavery, helping many people in the process. When the dust settled and the Legion was gone, Taklishim wasn't a vagabond any moreZ he was a leader."
 # BLU
  HONEST_DESC:0 "Mechanics are few and far between in the wasteland, especially in tribes. Honest was given breathing room by the Legion in return for his services as a mechanic, which he exploited as much as possible. Refusing to accept his position in the Legion once they were finished conquering his tribe, he eagerly awaited the day he could end their control."
 # JIC
  DELSHAY_DESC:0 "Already old by the time the Legion incorporated his tribe, Delshay never forgot his origins. Even when the Legion converted the children of his tribesmen to their dogma, he stayed silent, waiting for the day when he could pass on his knowledge without fear.

 # BVC
  Pancho_Villa_DESC:0 "Born as a poor boy to a smuggler from Colonet, Pancho Villa rose through the ranks of the Valle Bandits by ruthlessly expanding their smuggling business in the NCR. Every attempt at stopping their business was foiled by his ingenuity in creating new methods to smuggle in goods, and with the help of the Paz Bandits it appears that it won't be stopping any time soon. All of the proceeds from smuggling have gone to improve the living standards of the Valle's residents, causing him to enjoy great support from his people. In recent years, however, the NCR has been increasingly aggressive, sending settlers to displace his people. The resulting violence and it's aftermath have raised tensions even higher, and Pancho prepares for a conflict in the near future. Despite the overwhelming strength of the NCR, he stands by his people and is likely to fight if they decide to come after him."

Whilst a Mormon sympathiser, Rachel is no Mormon herself, and so in the power vacuum created by the collapse of Mormon power in the north she took her opperturnity to gather an alliance of comapnies and declared independence.

Whilst the Farfield Warband enjoyed a brief period of independence following the sack, a resurgent Mormon alliance proped up by tribal converts was able to crush the Warband and reclaim New Jerusalem not but a couple of decades later.
