  bgr_clearing_the_line_desc:0 "In order for production of metal shells to resume, and for the wonders of §RCOMMUNISM§! to once again grace the Casket's halls, we must clear out the rubble and destruction from the §MTHE CAPITALIZER§!'s previous attack."

  bgr_harvesting_local_minds:0 "Keeping Mind of How To Keep Minds"
  bgr_harvesting_local_minds_desc:0 "If we wish to ensure a steady and resurgent growth of the §RUNION MIND,§! we will need to take amicable steps to secure a proper pipeline from their miserable little §Mcapitalist hovels§! to our lovely little Casket."

  bgr_eyebot_patrols_desc:0 "With our renewing strength, unleashing what Eyebots we have leftover from our last life will help us secure the region outside of our facility... And §Rvanquish any ne'er-do-wells who wish to get in our way.§!"

  bgr_a_ideal_work_force_desc:0 "The Ideal Work Force, truly, is one that cannot fathom working outside of the system-- giving their utmost to contribute and acknowledge the greater needs of society over themselves. §RIf they cannot see this way by flesh, then they shall do so with metal, just as I have.§!"

  bgr_avoiding_the_CAPITALIZER_desc:0 "Though it has been quite some time, there is no doubt within my §RGIGABRAIN§! that §MTHE CAPITALIZER§! still roams these lands. Caution, nay, preparations must be made for their arrival... To have a repeat of last time would simply be too embarassing."

  bgr_refurbishing_frames_desc:0 "Many of the old Robobrains and other assorted machines in our employ still yet remain, trapped under rubble or kept safe beneath decades of searing-cold ice. It is time to take our §Rhammers§!, and our §Rsickles§!, and to carve them free of their timely prisons."
