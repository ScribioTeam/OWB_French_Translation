  nf_lanius_april_fools.1.d:0 "Caesar has vanished into thin air, and many presume him dead. In his place, a so-called Kaiser has come, bearing the mark of Mars... or so they say! But Lanius knows the truth, as does his cohort. The Kaiser is full of shit! Vulpes is a god-damn bastard! Fuck this new government, none of them have any right to rule from the seat of Flagstaff!\n\nWith his strength mustered in the east, Lanius and his garrisons have risen up against the supposed Kaiser's draconian rule, seeking to create a true successor state. Although we've pledged to leave the \"Kaiser\" alone, in truth Lanius is merely mustering his strength.\n\nLet us hope his provisions and eastward invading armies will be enough to prop up this new fledgling nation..."
  nf_lanius_april_fools.1.a:0 "Curse that §R\"Kaiser!\"§!"

  nf_lanius_april_fools.2.t:0 "Loyal Reinforcements"
  nf_lanius_april_fools.2.d:0 "Lanius's rallying cry has not gone unanswered! From across the pretender's lands, loyal soldiers have come flooding in to support our righteous cause, fed-up with Caesar's old lackies and their devotion to the interloper. Many among their ranks are seasoned veterans, and they bring with them hordes of legionaries willing to fight for what's right.\n\nBut that's not all they bring with them, with the advancing armies comes news of dastardly schemes being laid out by the new leader of Flagstaff; plans for supposed progress and stability. We see through his lies! This dimensional demon hiding within the skin of man seeks to rid the earth of the righteous embrace of Mars, and we shall have no part in it!\n\nRather, we will die fighting against it!"
  nf_lanius_april_fools.2.a:0 "Caesar may be gone, but his followers remain."

  nf_lanius_april_fools.3.t:0 "The Legacy of Caesar"
  nf_lanius_april_fools.3.d:0 "Caesar was a wise man gifted to us by Mars, a scholar who used his knowledge to revolutionize the art of war and take Arizona in his hands. He conquered tribe after tribe in seemingly impossible fashion as if it were as easy as breathing... and we mourn his loss each day.\n\nBut in his absence we still retain his knowledge, his tactics, and his faith in us; his ever loyal legions. With his advanced understanding of war drilled into the hearts and minds of our soldiers, how could we lose? We will conquer, conquer, and conquer some more... we'll turn the whole Wasteland red with blood and the banner of Caesar's Legion!"
  nf_lanius_april_fools.3.a:0 "He taught us well, and we would do well to remember."

  nf_lanius_april_fools.4.t:0 "The Pen or the Sword?"
  nf_lanius_april_fools.4.d:0 "Long has the Legion grappled with the reality of our military inferiority in the face of advanced technology. We bested the Brotherhood once in Arizona, but our losses were many, and some amongst us cried out in anger at Caesar's seeming indifference to our suffering. They were crucified. But now with Caesar gone we need ask ourselves; is our way of life truly right?\n\nWhile Caesar was right to criticise the Old World's over-reliance on advanced technology, and his thesis on its downfall as a result is resolute, are we not the perfect society to arm itself with the trappings of America's corpse?\n\nOthers might exploit such riches, we would surely use them properly... but on the other hand, none but us could achieve the perfect balance between advanced weapons and traditional living. If we abandon our principles, are we sullying Caesar's legacy?\n\nThe question facing us is one as old as written history... the pen, or the sword?"
  nf_lanius_april_fools.4.a:0 "§RThe sword!§!"
  nf_lanius_april_fools.4.b:0 "§OThe... pen?§!"

  nf_lanius_april_fools.5.t:0 "A Mere Book Signing"
  nf_lanius_april_fools.5.d:0 "§bThere's a man in front of you. He's telling you about a book, but you feel like you know him. \"I'm a priest of Mars\" he tells you, his body shuddering beneath a deep red robe. \"We've long advocated for the adoption of The Pen. The time is right, so why not pick It up, and write your name in the annals of history?\"\n\nYou look down at the book he's put on the table. It doesn't look like a history book, but you've never read a book, so who are you to judge? You feel something alien in your hand. It's The Pen. You look at it curiously, then look at the man. \"It can be difficult to Write, can't it? Do you know how to spell your name?" You nod. You've known your name since you were born, obviously.\n\nHe opens the book for you, how nice of him. He guides you to the right page, right where you need to write your name. Your men look at you curiously, expectantly, hungrily. They want you to do this, to do something. It's been difficult since the Kaiser arrived, things feel off somehow. The air tastes more alive, you think.\n\nThe book is looking up at you in the room. You don't look like the Son of Mars, but it doesn't know about religion, so what would it know? All it knows is that you need to write in it NOW.\n\nDo you remember what to write?§!"
