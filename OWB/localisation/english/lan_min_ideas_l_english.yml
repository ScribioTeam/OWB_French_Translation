    LAC_Mor:0 "Ryleigh Morrison"
    LAC_Mor_desc:0 "With Fort Summers under the control of the Legion, Morrison was forced to help the war machine. As a women, her combat prowess would end up far from the battlefield. With a collar around her neck, she oversees the construction of weapons to fuel the taming of the east."

    LAC_McKinley:0 "Chief Executive Mckinley"
    LAC_McKinley_desc:0 "Mckinley transitioned well to life under the legion. While she no longer lived in the lap of luxury, her sadism was still able to be expressed whenever quotas were not met. Within the workshops east of the Rio, she viewed her situation as less of a demotion and more of a sidegrade."

    LAC_Valencia:0 "Auxillary Valencia"
    LAC_Valencia_desc:0 "Many of the human's involved with Diana viewed the legion as just another brute in the Wasteland. When Valencia was assigned to work with Lanius, she felt as if her morals were being tested to work with these barbarians. Despite her objections, her willingness to ease human suffering finds many uses in a land of conquest and brutality. Some of the soldiers have even view her as an angel."

    LAC_Honest:0 "Honest"
    LAC_Honest_desc:0 "\"You knew this would happen again Honest. The Legion has need of your services, whether you like it or not. Fate knows your place here, even if you refuse to accept it.\""

    LAC_Mathius:0 "Mathius, Red Sun Visionary"
    LAC_Mathius_desc:0 "When many settled nations are conquered, the process of rebuilding must begin. The farmers, workers and other hard laborers transition neatly under the red flag of the Bull. Criminals, leechs, and the weak must earn their keep in this new existance, and taking the rubble of their old world and using it as the foundation for their new one is a good start."

    LAC_Paxton:0 "Paxton Auberdine"
    LAC_Paxton_desc:0 "Paxton ran a struggling trading business out of Longknife before the Legate arrived. Raiders, unpaved roads, and a struggling economy had left him nearly flat broke. With the Legion's control expanding eastward, the raiders dried up and the caps began to flow. A man nearly broken by the wastes now thrived thanks to the Legion. All of his caravans have begun offering discounts on transactions through Legion coin, his love of the Bull pushing its dominance further."

    LAC_Sheriff:0 "Sheriff Boucher"

    LAC_VanDoorn:0 "Peter Van Doorn"
    LAC_VanDoorn_desc:0 "While the former head of the Blue Rose Society has provided many insights on how we can improve our technology, we have to keep him from some of the more superstitious tribals. Those with weak faith in Mars find themselves believing many of the lies he spouts of strange creatures from beyond the stars."

    LAC_Bishop:0 "Archbishop Daegar"
    LAC_Bishop_desc:0 "\"Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.\" -Matthew 22:21"

    LAC_Caged:0 "Lozen Colorados"
    LAC_Caged_desc:0 "Colorados was the first of the East to fall to the Legion. Some might say there is honour in that, but Colorados remains silent about what she has done to save her people."

    LAC_Arrowbreaker:0 "Arrowbreaker"
    LAC_Arrowbreaker_desc:0 "\"You lost to the Legion. I've been where you were before, but you aren't the first conquered and most certainly not the last. You were allowed to live when you chose to oppose the Legate. If can't come to terms with reality, all that is left is a painful death. Be shaped as clay and build a better future, or feed the worthy as compost.\""

    LAC_Armistead:0 "Executive Armistead"
    LAC_Armistead_desc:0 "When the dust was settled and the Legion had conquered the Executives, few resisted against such an overwhelming force. Those dumb enough to openly fight where slaughtered like animals, but those with the spirit of a legionnaire were allowed to redeem themselves in the eyes of the Legate. "

    LAC_Starved:0 "Starved Dog"

    LAC_Vex:0 "Vexillarius Agrippa"
    LAC_Vex_desc:0 "The standard of a Legion inspires those who serve under the Bull. Not only is it a symbol of strength and unity, but a reminder of what they must protect. Should the Standard fall in battle, all know that their lives are forfeit in the eyes of the Legate."

    LAC_Instructor:0 "Instructor Dane"
    LAC_Instructor_desc:0 "One does not become a legionary overnight. They must be broken down, so they can be reformed in the image of the Bull. They will cry, they will bleed, but they can feel pride when they can finally feel the strength of a soldier."

    lac_servius:0 "Servius of Ganado"
    lac_servius_desc:0 "The Legion is no longer a band of tribes forced into having purpose. Servius was but a child when he was inducted into the Legion, and knows no other life besides one with a sword in hand. When Lanius announced his expedition to civilize the rest of New Mexico and whatever lies beyond, he was honored to take the torch of order and purpose into the lawless wastes."

    lac_fireball:0 "Fireball Petty"
    lac_fireball_desc:0 "Many in the Legion view Two Sun as a decadent blight upon the Legion's honor. Vehicles speeding across the wastes instead of marching by the merit of your own two feet, they consider them cowards for using machines to win their wars. Petty joined the expedition east not out of requirement, but to show that Two Sun is not a tumor on the legion. With the blessing of Senior, those who oppose us will be but a red stain upon asphalt."

    lac_ahiga:0 "Ahiga"
    lac_ahiga_desc:0 "\"Na dene has been protected from the harsh torture of the wastes, but this is not a gift. One day a giant will come to humble us all and I will not be found lacking. Skirmishes with your kind and the Ciphers is but child's play. Show me true war Legate, and I will show you the honor of the Navajo.\" - Skinwalker Ahiga "

    LAC_brotherhood_advisor:0 "Andrea Brixley"

    LAC_frumentarii:0 "Frumentarii Hadrian"
    LAC_frumentarii_desc:0 "The rules of war aren't new. Thousands of years of innovation and design will still fall to proper application of brain and brawn. The toughest robot and the hottest laser gun will find cracks in their systems, but spirit and discipline have tolerances far stronger than plastic and steel."
