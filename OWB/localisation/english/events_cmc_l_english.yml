  nf_event_cmc.1.d:0 "A police force that they couldn't control or bribe apparently was the last straw. It wasn't long after the official inauguration of the new police chief that things came to a head. Several members of the criminal underground stormed many of the high profile casinos, trying to take out, or take hostage, leading members of the casino families. All in a bid to gain control of those establishments. But we were prepared.\n\nI was prepared.\n\nThey were greeted by a hail of bullets, a good amount from my own pistol, killing many and making the rest flee outside, waiting for something.\nTo my dismay I recognized a few faces among the dead. People I thought of as friends. Family. I did not think the rift caused by our differing opinions went this deep.\n\nThe initial wave of attack beaten back I was about to retreat to one of the offices in the Red River Casino that was made into an impromptu war room. Aspen joined me half way there. I didn't see her in the defence, so I was pretty sure i knew what was going to happen. I was not surprised, just saddened when she pointed a gun at my head.\nWhat came as a surprise, at least to her, was the knife sticking out of her throat a blink of an eye later. \nHow to lead a casino was not the only thing my parents taught me.\nOur family was the first out of the bunkers. We didn't survive by pure chance against raiders and hostile creatures. That too is part of my legacy. A legacy that Aspen did not want. Lessons she never learned. \n\nIt's easy to see why they swayed her to their side. She had basically free access to wherever she feels like. This is invaluable if certain people want to gain information or access to certain areas.\n\nAfter one last look at her body, I carried on. The night was still young and they were still waiting outside. We radioed the police for assistance. This would be a trial by fire for them too."

  nf_event_cmc.2.d:0 "Things have been brewing below the surface of our nation for a while. Certain people of importance tended to vanish or turned up dead. Accidents, all of them, I was assured. Things turned up missing. Weapons, ammunition, information. Now, what I've dreaded has come to pass. Tonight several members of the criminal underground stormed many of the high profile casinos trying to take out, or take hostage, leading members of the casino families. All in a bid to gain control of those establishments.\n\nAnd i am completely helpless to stop them.\n\nThose still loyal to me and I tried the best we could to defend everything we build, but it was a losing battle from the start.\nWhen the doors burst open, i recognized many of the faces. People I thought of as friends. Family. I did not think the rift caused by our differing opinions went this deep.\n\nWe were making a fighting retreat towards a safe room we set up for a case just like this. Aspen joined me half way there. I didn't see her in the defence, so I was pretty sure i knew what was going to happen. I closed my eyes expecting a shot to end it all. I heard the shot, but the expected short burst of pain before the end did not appear. I opened my eyes again.\nLiam was lying dead on the floor next to me. The shot was never meant for me. I saw us being surrounded by various gang members on all sides. This fight was over.\nAspen looked at me with a nasty grin on her face.\n'He would just have be a nuisance, so it was time to get rid of him. You on the other hand, we still need. You are going to be our bird in a cage, doing exactly as we tell you to. Otherwise his life will not be the only one ended this way.'\nA threat not to me, but towards loved ones. Leaving me with no way out.\nI just want this to be over."

  nf_event_cmc.4.t:0 "Looking for Love"
  nf_event_cmc.4.d:0 "I arrived at KXII Station without any issues. About half way there we were greeted by a group of Tubehead guards, accompanying us the rest of the way. I expected the usual raider look, honestly. Leather, metal spikes, the occasional skull or bone. What i saw was military gear over fine suits. It was different, to say the least. The meeting took place in one of the recording studios. I had seen this place before, on TV. It's where he hosts his 'Talk Show' with various guests. I asked if he was recording this negotiation for his show too. He just laughed and answered that he just felt the most comfortable in this place, that's why he chose it. The 'tense negotiations' were done incredibly quick. We disagreed on some details, but came to an agreement in the span of half an hour. It came down to our investment money, their technical expertise and established media catalogue. The rest of the evening that i thought i would spend arguing with a raider warlord putting on a civilized front was instead spend having a pleasant conversation over various topics. Some meaningless, some in regards to both of our situations. We drank a bit, laughed together. It was a nice distraction from everything that has been going on recently."

  nf_event_cmc.5.t:0 "The Fate of the Scrappers"
  nf_event_cmc.5.d:0 "The Scrappers know every nook and cranny of the corroded fields. Not a day has passed without some of them springing out of some trailer of a truck we thought was empty, or our workers being sniped from the top of some old construction equipment. Just for them to vanish in a blink of an eye once we manage a counter attack. Workers are refusing to work in the area and we are wasting too much resources and men on this. So we moved in our troops again in full force to stop this.\nA lucky operation managed to get us one of their clan chiefs as prisoner. After a brief 'discussion' with him, we send him back with a proposal. Their tenacity despite such overwhelming odds facing them is admirable and we could use warriors like them. Everyone has a price and working for us beats being hunted down like rabid dogs. The other options we gave him was that we would hire them as workers in the area. They could basically do what they did before we came along, but the good bits of scrap would go directly to us. Let's see what their answer will be."

  nf_event_cmc.6.d:0 "It was that night all over again. Except this time it was me waiting outside to burst in some doors. Waiting with a large amount of Tubehead soldiers. More blood was spilled. More blood on my hands. I can console myself with the fact that it was to rescue people. To save my friends and family. And what my family has build. [TUB.GetLeader]'s troops sure knew what they were doing. It was over mercifully quick.\n Aspen, though, was nowhere to be found. My office, now actually mine again, was abandoned by the time i arrived there. She wasn't among the bodies either. She just vanished.\n I need to set a team on trying to find her again. To either capture her, or...it doesn't matter now. There is work to be done. We need to clean up this mess."

Haggard and weary, she told of being persecuted in her nation, of being wrongfully accused of crimes by her own sister who wanted to get rid of her to take her place. Now she asks for sanctuary in our nation. She is willing to work for a living and show what made her so successful that people became jealous enough to chase her out.\nAre we willing to believe her story?\n\n§RThis will probably anger the [CMC.GetName]!§!"

There is too much blood on her hands. The [FROM.GetName] are not willing to giver her up, she is too firmly entrenched in their hierarchy.

Quite literally in this case, as [TUB.GetLeader] has seen it fit to produce a special broadcast this night. The reason for this was clear as only a few minutes into the show after a short musical number by one of [TUB.GetLeader]s live bands, both of them walked in front of the camera, presenting their new born child to a cheering audience. The proud parents talked briefly about future plans concerning both nations before they retreated backstage again, wishing viewers and home audience alike a pleasant evening and giving the stage to an ensemble of various live acts."

While the cook says the original recipe requires meat from something called a ‘scorchbeast’, which nobody here has ever heard of, it does taste pretty damn nice with just regular brahmin meat.

Do you know how hard it is to get proper window pane large enough in size for a store window? The street lights will be easier to repair, but it will still take some time to find spare parts."

One of them mentioned with a new lady friend that more of his friends would be visiting real soon, and smirked.  \n\nAnyway, because we're not idiots we arrested them and they revealed they're from some group called the 'Enclave' in Illinois.
