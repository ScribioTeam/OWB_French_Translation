  arr_meet_chitsa:0 "Vault 13's Young One"
  arr_meet_chitsa_desc:0 "Survivors of Vault 13 were among those rescued by the Chosen One at the Enclave Oil Rig. A child, far too young to remember these events, was one of the lucky few that escaped."

  arr_meet_umbra:0 "Child of an Old Friend"
  arr_meet_umbra_desc:0 "Sulik was an old friend and valuable companion on the search for the holy G.E.C.K. and Enclave Oil Rig. He has passed on since then, but his child, Avueron, now leads their tribe."
  arr_learn_from_sulik:0 "Sulik's Old Ways"
  arr_learn_from_sulik_desc:0 "Since Avueron took control of the tribe he's worked tirelessly to prepare his people for the realities of Northern California. They've begun to modernize and give up their old ways, but we still have much to learn from their tribal ferocity."
  arr_umbra_weapon_workshops:0 "Tribal Weapons Workshops"
  arr_umbra_weapon_workshops_desc:0 "No matter their backwardness, Umbra weaponsmiths have developed creative ways to construct weapons for their tribe. Mimicking these techniques might increase our weapons production."

  arr_meet_klamath:0 "There Was Once A Peaceful Port"
  arr_meet_klamath_desc:0 "The small port town of Eureka has only recently managed to recover from the Great War. Faced with an impervious mirelurk infestation, their unconventional tactics are worth learning from."
  arr_skinning_lessons:0 "Skinning Lessons from Klamath"
  arr_skinning_lessons_desc:0 "Skinning a Gecko is an arduous task, as even the slightest mistake can make a hide outright useless. A new technique invented by Klamath trappers allows us to quickly skin an animal without damaging the hide."
  arr_trapper_techniques:0 "Trapper Techniques"
  arr_trapper_techniques_desc:0 "Trappers from Klamath are expert at tool use, navigation and pathfinding. Teaching those techniques to our soldiers would improve the versatility of our army."
  arr_hunting_weapons:0 "New Hunting Weapons"
  arr_hunting_weapons_desc:0 "While tribals like to use crude weapons to hunt, we can do better than spears. Procuring new rifles to our trappers will them to hunt more efficiently."

  arr_meet_packers:0 "Investigating Happy Camp"
  arr_meet_packers_desc:0 "Despite his extensive travels, the Chosen One knows little about the Packers. Extremely reclusive, their society seems to be organized around a number of disparate camps."
  arr_learn_from_foragers:0 "Learning from the Foragers"
  arr_learn_from_foragers_desc:0 "The Packers are foragers by nature, with an inherent ability to seek out sources of life and fresh water. Although the G.E.C.K. has helped revitalize Arroyo we have yet to fully understand all the boons it has brought us, and the Packers can no doubt help."
  arr_supply_forward_units:0 "Wilderness Supply Operations"
  arr_supply_forward_units_desc:0 "The Packers use a number of well hidden paths to move quickly around their forested home. Their methods are worth studying, even if we aren't able to locate the trails themselves."

  arr_meet_max_sec:0 "High Security, High Stakes"
  arr_meet_max_sec_desc:0 "A decade ago, a rich baron from Redding going by The Investor brought a team of mercenaries north, slowly rebuilding an old prison found in Medford. From there the team began to travel from town to town, purchasing criminals for their new scheme."
  arr_prison_building_expertise:0 "Prison Building Expertise"
  arr_prison_building_expertise_desc:0 "The reconstruction begun by the mercenaries was continued by Max Sec's new workforce. Slowly, a decrepit complex became a vertible fortress."
  arr_building_defenses:0 "Building Defenses"
  arr_building_defenses_desc:0 "We won't build a workforce similar to Max Sec's, but we could model our own defenses after theirs. They've built defenses against enemies both inside and outside their own state."
  arr_building_a_nation:0 "Building a Nation"
  arr_building_a_nation_desc:0 "The area around Max Sec is by no means uninhabited. The native people first viewed the prison with caution, but the fruits of the imported labor have led to a rapid growth in the region's prosperity."

  arr_nagor_start:0 "The General On Duty"
  arr_nagor_start_desc:0 "The first thing Nagor did was get to work. He knew that, as council leader, he would have a grueling year of work ahead of him. He was thankful for the people around him most of all. The progress Arroyo will make in this coming year was due primarily to their steadfast dedication."
  arr_deploy_merrymen:0 "Deploying the Merrymen"
  arr_deploy_merrymen_desc:0 "The Merrymen were created as an offshoot of the Arroyan militia following the end of the Chosen One's quest. Originally devised as a corps of engineers they've since become Nagor's personal problem-solvers, dealing with infrastructure and housing crises across the tribal lands."
  arr_redeploy_builders:0 "Redeploy Army Builders"
  arr_redeploy_builders_desc:0 "Arroyo had been blessed with peace ever since the events at the Oil Rig. Still, Nagor had been careful to prepare his warriors for both peace and war. The army builders make up a sizeable portion of the military's manpower, and can be used to kickstart new infrastructure projects when needed."
  arr_redeploy_manufacturers:0 "Redeploy Army Manufacturers"
  arr_redeploy_manufacturers_desc:0 "A force of specialized weaponsmiths was hired and maintained by Nagor's army, ensuring access to quality weapons in times of crisis or scarcity. If needed, these weaponsmiths could be assigned to a variety of jobs, bolstering Arroyan supply lines."
  arr_recruit_workshop_workers:0 "Recruit Workshop Workers"
  arr_recruit_workshop_workers_desc:0 "If in desperate need Nagor is also authorized to recruit healthy workers from the general civilian body. This situation would be in no way ideal, but may allow us to raise an additional host of reserves."
  arr_our_backs_to_paradise:0 "With Our Backs to Paradise"
  arr_our_backs_to_paradise_desc:0 "The Chosen One worked tirelessly to make our home a paradise and gifted us with the vigor and will to defend it. No matter what, we must stand firm against aggression."
  arr_our_eyes_on_enemies:0 "With Our Eyes on Enemies"
  arr_our_eyes_on_enemies_desc:0 "The best defense is a good offense. Waiting for our enemies to appear and take us by surprise will only lead to swift destruction. We was strike decisively, eliminating potential threats."
  arr_sharpening_lenses:0 "Sharpening Our Swords"
  arr_sharpening_lenses_desc:0 "The sword - a weapon as old as time. Used to strike down grand and nefarious villains, the sword is a symbol of valor and hope."
  arr_raising_shields:0 "Raising Our Shields"
  arr_raising_shields_desc:0 "The shield - a protector older than civilization. A reliable defense against an attacker, the shield is a timeless symbol of resistance."
  arr_spoils_of_war:0 "The Spoils of War"
  arr_spoils_of_war_desc:0 "War is a savage and ignoble beast. Nagor has learned that well enough. But, he's also learned that war can bring wealth, and profit. The balance between the two is cruel, but every war might bring riches to Arroyo."
  arr_never_forget:0 "Never Forget"
  arr_never_forget_desc:0 "Even as he grows old, Nagor has found the fear of Enclave vertibirds impossible to forget. The terror of those giant metal men still leaves him shaking awake at night, and he has vowed to never allow his tribe to be reduced to such a state again."
  arr_never_allow:0 "Never Allow"
  arr_never_allow_desc:0 "Nagor also knows that the Enclave did not suddenly appear, even though it may have seemed that way at the time. Plans and designs that far predated his birth had led to that terror. The helplessness that he had felt then could only have been prevented by a preemptive strike."
  arr_motorgang_recruitment:0 "Motorgang Recruitment"
  arr_motorgang_recruitment_desc:0 "Generally disorganized and small-scale, various motorgangs hold some presence in the highways and roads around Arroyo. While Arroyan authorities will lead occasional crackdowns, Nagor has begun to realize that these criminals might better serve as a toughened backbone of the army."
  arr_tribal_means:0 "Tribal Means"
  arr_tribal_means_desc:0 "Nagor has spent years discussing tactics and strategies with the Chosen One. While he isn't one for treatises or theses, he has learned to reflect on past decisions. This approach has led to a distinctly Arroyan type of warfare."
  arr_to_tribal_ends:0 "To Tribal Ends"
  arr_to_tribal_ends_desc:0 "Chitsa and Nagor aren't much alike. They speak differently, think differently, and, in the past, have done their best to stay at arm's length. Yet, recently, that's begun to change. They've been speaking, giving each other advice, and most surprisingly, acting on it."
  arr_junkyard_fixers:0 "Junkyard Fixers"
  arr_junkyard_fixers_desc:0 "The bikers construct their rides from a variety of scrapyards in the region. To most, these dumps look like nothing more than piles of junk. However, the crafty member of a motorgang knows exactly how to pick apart a pile of engines to find all the right pieces."
  arr_frontline_doctors:0 "Frontline Doctors"
  arr_frontline_doctors_desc:0 "Dimitri has worked hard to train a wide array of medical professionals. They do important work in Arroyo, but our soldiers at the front require attention too. Dimitri always says the protecting the most vulnerable is a doctor's first duty, after all."
  arr_biker_integration:0 "Biker Integration"
  arr_biker_integration_desc:0 "Simply recruiting members of the motorgangs won't go far enough. We need to make sure they act as an integrated part of our larger force, rather than an independent group."
  arr_an_army_for_the_people:0 "An Army For The People"
  arr_an_army_for_the_people_desc:0 "Arroyo's army serves only the people. It could not possibly serve the interests of any force but them, and their overwhelming support of the armed forces confirms this."
  arr_army_special_forces:0 "The Army's Special Forces"
  arr_army_special_forces_desc:0 "Originally, tribal warriors were the only force that stood to defend Arroyo from wandering beasts and exterior threats. Those times have long passed, but the idea of an elite group of warriors spearheading Arroyan war efforts certainly have not."
  arr_our_own_metal_men:0 "Our Own Metal Men"
  arr_our_own_metal_men_desc:0 "The technology of the Enclave forces is now within our grasp. Advancements by our scientific core have allowed us to begin construction on Power Armor similar to theirs. Its quality is far worse, at least for now, but it is a sure sign of our growing power."
  arr_stripping_fear:0 "Stripping Away Fear"
  arr_stripping_fear_desc:0 "The metal men are just that - men. And all men bleed, no matter what armor they wear or weapons they wield. We will show our warriors that through these high powered rifles, each specially designed to crack open their armor like a tin can."
  arr_reliable_warfare:0 "Reliable Warfare"
  arr_reliable_warfare_desc:0 "Supply is the esscence of warfare. Providing the best possible materials will dictate our success in battle, and Nagor has gone to great lengths to personally supervise logistical efforts in the Arroyan army."

  arr_chitsa_start:0 "Her Way"
  arr_chitsa_start_desc:0 "As everyone else filed out of the council chambers Chitsa sat quietly and thought. She had gotten exactly what she wished for - as council leader, she would have free reign to pursue a number of the... avenues she was interested in."
  arr_dorris_warbands:0 "Dorris Warbands"
  arr_dorris_warbands_desc:0 "The Den had long been a tumor in Arroyan trade. As an alternate route to the north, it offered trades a method to avoid Arroyan markets. Chitsa's spies had spent the previous few years making contact with raiders in Dorris, allowing her to pay them off to step up their raids on traders in the region."
  arr_backdoor_purchases:0 "Backdoor Purchases"
  arr_backdoor_purchases_desc:0 "While Nagor might be focused on pursuing self-sufficiency in the military, Chitsa knew that the easiest way to obtain weapons would involve importing them. Crucially, the imports had to be done discreetly, so as to avoid alerting Arroyo's neighbors to their plans."
  arr_market_preference:0 "Winning Market Preference"
  arr_market_preference_desc:0 "The Gun Runners, Van Graffs, Chop Shop... none lacked demand for their products. In order to make sure Arroyo was first in line Chitsa worked tirelessly to build personal connections with many of the organizations around the wasteland."
  arr_support_gun_runners:0 "Support the Gun Runners"
  arr_support_gun_runners_desc:0 "The Gun Runners were of special interest to Chitsa. Their products almost perfectly matched Arroyo's demand. So Chitsa drew up a plan: a few Gun Runners merchants would be attacked by psychiotic raiders near Umbra. Of course, the timely arrival of Arroyan irregulars would save the day."
  arr_fourways_extortion:0 "Extorting Fourways"
  arr_fourways_extortion_desc:0 "Fourways is a well known trading town on the most commonly used route between Redding and Arroyo. While officially a neutral zone, a battle for influence over the region has been silently stirring over the past few years. Chitsa will make sure Arroyo wins that battle."
  arr_deep_warrior_training:0 "Deep Warrior Training"
  arr_deep_warrior_training_desc:0 "A warrior's body is not their only weapon. Chitsa plans to design and introduce a number of mental training regimens, aimed at improving our fighters' ability to perform under stress and resist enemy interrogations."
  arr_trader_rest_stops:0 "Trader Rest Stops"
  arr_trader_rest_stops_desc:0 "Sadly, much of the infrastructure in our territory has begun to decay, deterring traders from entering our lands. Investing in rest stops along our roads should alleviate this somewhat."
  arr_developing_sixes:0 "The Sixes Trading Dock"
  arr_developing_sixes_desc:0 "The port at the Sixes represents underutilized potential for Arroyo's economy. Most trade might come to Arroyo through land routes, but expanding the docks might allow for a safer alternative, at least for those that can afford a boat."
  arr_supplying_demand:0 "Supplying Demand"
  arr_supplying_demand_desc:0 "Weapons may normally be for the army, but Chitsa has a clever idea in mind. Expanding domestic weapons production might allow certain export opportunities, allowing Arroyo to cash in on wasteland anarchy."
  arr_pows_as_builder_slaves:0 "War Prisoners as Builder-Slaves"
  arr_pows_as_builder_slaves_desc:0 "Nagor's army has won numerous battles and brought back a variety of prisoners. So far they've lounged in our hospitality, no doubt waiting to return home one day. With enough convincing Chitsa could turn those lazy prisoners into Arroyan slaves, integrating them into the Arroyan economy."
  arr_geck_clearings:0 "G.E.C.K. Clearings in Arroyo"
  arr_geck_clearings_desc:0 "One of the immediate benefits of the G.E.C.K. was its clearing of needless forests and boulders to make space for arable land. The device's power is long tapped, but our builders can follow in its footsteps, making room for further industrial expansion."
  arr_expansion_in_sixes:0 "Sixes to Sevens"
  arr_expansion_in_sixes_desc:0 "Chitsa tossed another leaflet into the bin behind her. The advertisement ideas she had been presented with so far seemed... lackluster, at best. Most tried to directly emulate the New Reno style, coming across as sarcastic at best. Sixes to Sevens? Really? How was that going to attract migrants?"
  arr_expansion_in_the_pass:0 "Build a Bigger Pass"
  arr_expansion_in_the_pass_desc:0 "Grant's Pass is some of the most naturally unhospitable land in our territory. Unfortunately, our G.E.C.K. was used primarily on the core Arroyo area, leaving the pass as a rugged area with little value. Manual labor can change that, but will take time."
  arr_goods_to_sell:0 "Goods for the People"
  arr_goods_to_sell_desc:0 "Not everything produced in an Arroyan workshop can be a gun, body armor, or bullet. Increasing the quantity of household goods in Arroyo will remind the people how Chitsa cares for them, fostering loyalty to the council."
  arr_production_deals:0 "Deals With All Sorts"
  arr_production_deals_desc:0 "The best approach to diplomacy requires a neutral outlook. Judging yourself as morally righteous, or looking down on others as stuck up snobs, will only lead to disagreement."
  arr_stockpiling_metal:0 "Metal Stockpiles"
  arr_stockpiling_metal-desc:0 "Overwhelmingly common in the wasteland, metal acts as a the essential element behind every new expedition or project. Buying and storing metal from our neighbors will act as a useful reserve were we ever to need it."
  arr_trade_leader:0 "Our Trade Leader"
  arr_trade_leader_desc:0 "Chitsa has come far since she first began to order those ball players. She now commands an army of traders that all but swear loyalty to her and will certainly continue to expand that empire further."
  arr_wealth_is_health:0 "Wealth is Health"
  arr_wealth_is_health_desc:0 "Chitsa's maneuverings have left the Tribal Council with more than enough in their coffers. Maybe it's just the other members of the council getting to her, but she's begun to realize that the strength of a tribe does not solely rest on the power of its leaders. Reinvestment in Arroyo could help everyone, and, most importantly, herself."

  arr_dimitri_start:0 "The Doctor Is In"
  arr_dimitri_start_desc:0 "Dimitri was glad to see that his tireless work to integrate himself into the Arroyo tribe was beginning to pay off. He began to work in earnest after the meeting adjourned, keenly aware that whatever funding he needed for research or construction projects was now his."
  arr_army_research_division:0 "The Army Research Division"
  arr_army_research_division_desc:0 "Some in the military see research as a tool only useful in the construction of more powerful weapons. Unlike his former teachers, Dimitri sees a purpose in war, but still maintains that army research should be a secondary priority."
  arr_new_warfare_doctrine:0 "New Warfare Doctrine"
  arr_new_warfare_doctrine_desc:0 "The 'fog of war' is a term commonly used to describe the confusion that permeates any organized conflict. Dimitri was by no means a military man, but by consulting with the Arroyan generals and officers he hoped to introduce a scientific percision into the Arroyan army."
  arr_retrofit_old_equipment:0 "Retrofit Old Equipment"
  arr_retrofit_old_equipment_desc:0 "Small skirmishes over the past few decades have led to a sizeable stockpile of old weapons in the Arroyan army. Many may be on the edge of functionality, but a concerted effort to repair them might work to the army's advantage."
  arr_air_domination:0 "Creating Air Domination"
  arr_air_domination_desc:0 "Air power is an oft neglected aspect of warfare in the wasteland. Few tribes have the knowledge to understand the science behind it, let alone construct the planes. Thankfully, Dimitri's background has prepared him to find the personnel needed for an Arroyan air force."
  arr_fostering_ground_support:0 "Fostering Ground Support"
  arr_fostering_ground_support_desc:0 "Air power should, primarily, serve to benefit ground forces. Careful training and clear communication is a key aspect of successful air superiority."
  arr_review_communication_procedures:0 "Review Communication Procedures"
  arr_review_communication_procedures_desc:0 "Now that we have experience in air warfare, Dimitri has instructed that we refine and standardize our radio communications with our pilots. It won't be a complex process, but the increased efficiency will go a long way towards aiding our pilots in combat."
  arr_batch_thirty:0 "Batch Thirty"
  arr_batch_thirty_desc:0 "After numerous iterations on the basic glider our researchers have invented a streamlined apparatus. While still outpaced by more advanced planes, what is now being called "Batch Thirty" combines ease of manufacturing with increased weapons and reliability."
  arr_the_followers_teachings:0 "The Followers' Teachings"
  arr_the_followers_teachings_desc:0 "Dimitri vehemently disagreed with the Followers' perspective on the wasteland. Violence may be regrettable, but to condemn it outright was overly idealistic."
  arr_adopting_the_strays:0 "Adopting The Strays"
  arr_adopting_the_strays_desc:0 "Wild dogs are commonplace across the wasteland, especially in tribal areas. Most families lack the resources or time to take them in, meaning Arroyo might be one of the few places where they could find a home."
  arr_emergency_surture_kits:0 "Emergency Surture Kits"
  arr_emergency_surture_kits_desc:0 "Battlefield medicine is the silent foundation of every strong army. Dimitri has spent the past few months working tirelessly with army medics to increase the quality of emergency care, hopefully allowing more of our wounded to make it home alive."
  arr_prisoner_test_subjects:0 "Prisoner Test Subjects"
  arr_prisoner_test_subjects_desc:0 "The Max Sec prisoners are, by any definition, the scum of the earth. They're lucky that they still breathe after their various heinous crimes, making them perfect subjects for dubious medical tests. Many doctors would object to this (including, at one point in his life, Dimitri himself), but the advances that could be gained far outweigh the ethical questions."
  arr_great_society:0 "A Great Tribe"
  arr_great_society_desc:0 "Dimitri learned quickly that Arroyans are a deeply proud people. They see themselves as the descendants of one hero and being led by another. That pride may not be ill-founded, but it could, at times, be at odds with reality. Despite the G.E.C.K.'s work, Arroyo lacked serious economic power - especially when compared to the NCR."
  arr_school_building:0 "School Building"
  arr_school_building_desc:0 "Dimitri has been in Arroyo long enough to see one generation of Arroyans reach adolescence. It's a touchy subject for much of the population, but tribal schools stand to provide a far superior education to whatever learning exists in Arroyan homes."
  arr_road_building:0 "Road Building"
  arr_road_building_desc:0 "Even within Arroyo small towns can sometimes be entirely separate from nearby population centers. An organized road building plan could integrate the entire population within a larger communications network, strengthening tribal identity."
  arr_clearing_forests:0 "Clearing Forests"
  arr_clearing_forests_desc:0 "A number of outlying forests in the region only serve to hamper population growth. Normally, they are simply bastions for mutated creatures or bandits, if not reclusive ghoul hideouts."
  arr_constructing_on_hills:0 "Arroyo Atop a Hill"
  arr_constructing_on_hills_desc:0 "Everything Dimitri has done has been to further Arroyo's splendor. He has put up with distrust and misunderstanding for decades, all to make this quiet northern land into a paradise for its people. Finally, it seems as if his work is starting to pay off."
  arr_further_industrial_planning:0 "Further Industrial Planning"
  arr_further_industrial_planning_desc:0 "Going forward, Arroyo needed a plan. Much of its early industry had been scraped together, similar to the rest of the wasteland. Dimitri's education had taught him the value of planning ahead, a lesson which he hoped to impart to the Arroyan people."
  arr_agricultural_expansion:0 "Agricultural Expansion"
  arr_agricultural_expansion_desc:0 "The ever growing population required a wider base of agriculture to draw from, and the newly cleared land could act as a perfect base for it."
  arr_a_flourishing_society:0 "A Flourishing Society"
  arr_a_flourishing_society_desc:0 "Care, attention, and planning have all led to Arroyo's present greatness. To the Arroyans fourty years ago, this level of advancement would seem like a totally different world. Even those who lived through those times can hardly believe their eyes, and marvel at modern Arroyo."
  arr_sanitation_exploration:0 "Sanitation Exploration"
  arr_sanitation_exploration_desc:0 "Before the Great War, every city and town had a working sanitation system. That idea is a stark impossibility now, except for in Arroyo itself. Better sanitation, and therefore healthier people, pay dividends over time."
  arr_exploiting_the_land:0 "Exploiting the Land"
  arr_exploiting_the_land_desc:0 "The wealth of a people is measured in the wealth of their land. Prior to Dimitri, Arroyans were often unwilling to extract "too much", but that tribalistic notion needs to be done away with. The land's resources are ours to make use of, after all."
  arr_chosen_one_returns:0 "The Chosen One Returns"
  arr_chosen_one_returns_desc:0 "His return was silent, like his departure. Time will tell if he is the bearer of good news."
  arr_my_wanderings:0 "My Wanderings"
  arr_my_wanderings_desc:0 "The Chosen One has a lot of stories. Vices of Reno, Fledging Republic of California, Riders of Utah. Nothing we haven't known of. But he seems to be more troubled than the past. Some of us wonder whether the harsh reality of the wasteland has gotten to him."
  arr_facing_the_council:0 "Facing the Council"
  arr_facing_the_council_desc:0 "Originally intended to be an advisory council, council members took the mantle of the Chosen One after he silently departed. With his return, many wonder whether he will continue to guide Arroyo to the future. Council will convene to determine the fate of Arroyo."
  arr_a_glorious_return:0 "A Glorious Return"
  arr_a_glorious_return_desc:0 "Chosen One returned to Arroyo in glory. For three days Arroyo celebrated the return of their hero, knowing that their hero returned to them in their time of need."
  arr_a_quiet_return:0 "A Quiet Return"
  arr_a_quiet_return_desc:0 "Though Arroyo celebrated his return for three days, he did not partake in any of the festivities. It seems he wants some peace and quiet after a life of adventure. He will continue to protect Arroyo from outsiders though."
  arr_good_1:0 "Old Friends"
  arr_good_1_desc:0 "While our isolation kept us from formalities of diplomacy, our relations with the Republic has always been amicable. Perhaps its time to formalise the friendship between two countries and lay the groundwork for further cooperation."
  arr_fou_1:0 "Fourways That Goes Two Ways"
  arr_fou_1_desc:0 "Californian Republic offered us to guarantee our independence in return of a small payment. While some oppose to pay 'tribute' to the Republic, this could deter any faction from attacking Arroyo."
  arr_fou_2:0 "Fourways Try Our Way"
  arr_fou_2_desc:0 "Republic, in light of the newfound respect between the two nations and being already overextended on two fronts, lost interest on Fourways. This means we can enforce our claims without treading on the bear."
  arr_fou_3:0 "The Gift from Old Friends"
  arr_fou_3_desc:0 "The Republic now sends caravans as north as Fourways, which allow us to sell and buy goods directly to the Californian market, granting us much needed income."
  arr_eur_1:0 "Eurekan Fisheries"
  arr_eur_1_desc:0 "Eurekan Fisheries are now derelict. Though we have enough skilled workers to operate the fisheries, we lack the technology and the capital to do so. Perhaps we can set up a joint business with the Republic."
  arr_eur_2:0 "Eureka Moment"
  arr_eur_2_desc:0 "Spending decades as mercenaries, Eurekan Mercaneries developed their own, unique war style. Though their prices are heavy, their skills are impeccable."
  arr_the_barons:0 "Deal with The Barons"
  arr_the_barons_desc:0 "With our recent expansion and the stability we brought to the region, we are experiencing a population boom. To prevent a famine, we will make a deal with the Brahmin Barons of the NCR, who will supply us with fresh food."
  arr_republic_taxes:0 "Republic Taxes"
  arr_republic_taxes_desc:0 "Our ties to the Republic and the growing trade between nations force our hand to pay more taxes to the Republic."
  arr_ncr_support:0 "Support From Old Friends"
  arr_ncr_support_desc:0 "While most of the NCR support until now have been nominal, NCR congress took steps to make their support official, greatly alleviating many of our problems."
  arr_ncr_statehood:0 "NCR Statehood"
  arr_ncr_statehood_desc:0 "Once we thought if we isolated ourselves from the outside world, we could protect ourselves from it. It is not the case anymore. In an ever-changing world, we can no longer hide our heads in the sand. We will petition to become the newest member of the Republic as the State Of Arroyo."
  arr_ncr_acceptance:0 "Accept The NCR"
  arr_ncr_acceptance_desc:0 "It is time for a greater cooperation with the Republic. We will formally ally ourselves with the NCR without compromising our own identity."
  arr_neutral_1:0 "Old Acquaintances"
  arr_neutral_1_desc:0 "While Arroyo never had formal relations with outside, The Chosen One acted as an ambassador of Arroyo, forging relations with many factions of the wasteland."
  arr_max_sec_reopen:0 "Reopen Max Sec"
  arr_max_sec_reopen_desc:0 "MaxSec prison was a dangerous business, but it had great potential. We can give it a second chance."
  arr_reno_arms_deal:0 "Reno Arms Deal"
  arr_reno_arms_deal_desc:0 "Reno, being the city of sin it is, needs a lot of guns. They would pay generously for the surplus guns we have. What they do with them is not our concern."
  arr_vlt_army_deal:0 "Vault City Military Training"
  arr_vlt_army_deal_desc:0 "Despite their xenophobia, Vault City accepts to train outsiders in their Military Training programme. Sending some of our forces to be trained by an elite force would greatly benefit our army."
  arr_klamath_trappers:0 "Klamath Trappers"
  arr_klamath_trappers_desc:0 "Trappers of Klamath are excellent pathfinders and a boon for local economy. Perhaps we can enlist their services."
  arr_yakuza_deal:0 "Yakuza Connection"
  arr_yakuza_deal_desc:0 "As dangerous as the crime families of Reno, Yakuza make good allies and fierce enemies. We can always make use of having contacts in the Yakuza for our shady dealings."
  arr_modoc_deal:0 "Modoc Deal"
