  utah_religion_dea_2:0 "Memories of the Legate"
  utah_religion_dea_2_desc:0 "A lifetime of war leaves its marks, both on the body and the soul. There is much to be learnt by our people from the trials of the burned man, both from his victories, and his failures."

  utah_religion_lon:0 "Umbra"
  utah_religion_lon_desc:0 "When the world was broken down by apocalyptic fire, when the great clouds of ash had settled, and those few survivors that remained dared not leave their shelters, the world was finally at peace. No more light, no more movement, no more sound. Humanity, however, rejected this purity, and once again begain to fill the world with their disgusting clamour. Now, only we who recognise the holiness of this oblivion still pay respect to the great silence."

  utah_religion_lon_2:0 "Walking in the Shadows"

  utah_learning_from_god:0 "Learning from Elohim"
  utah_learning_from_god_desc:0 "While they consider themselves to be the first tribe amongst tribes, there is no denying that the mormons have not fallen as far from paradise as we have. With their help, we may yet regain the knowledge that our forefathers lost."
