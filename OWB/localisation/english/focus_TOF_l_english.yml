  tof_unique: "A Star is Born"
  tof_unique_desc: "In the chain gang days, the warden would occasionally reward us with showings of movies from before the war. Wonder if we couldn't make our own with all these cameras?"
  tof_raider_pa: "Fucking Power Armor!"
  tof_raider_pa_desc: "God I love this stuff. Put this on boys!"
  tof_vipers: "Shitbag Vipers"
  tof_vipers_desc: "When we were smaller, at one point, we tried settling in Viper territory. They ended up kicking us out! The nerve!"
  tof_jackals: "Crazy Fuck Face Jackals"
  tof_jackals_desc: "'Cannibals'? How disgusting! I am revolting just thinking about living with these guys. I can't risk my men living near them - lets bring them to heel!"

  tof_ind_1_desc: "Marianne always used to like riding up ramps and making big jumps back in Utah."
  tof_rebuild_viper_city: "Vipertown"
  tof_rebuild_viper_city_desc: "We beat up the Vipers, took their guns, brought them low -.. but we can't just 'kill them'! Raiders have to stick up for each other, yeah? Lets set up a little town for them that they can live from."
  tof_rebuild_jackal_city: "Jackaltown"
  tof_rebuild_jackal_city_desc: "These freaky Jackals might be fucked, but they can still be useful to us if we leave a few of them around. Lets make a little town for them to live in... Mostly so that we can keep them away from our camps!"
  tof_ind_11: "Big Bitch Bombs"
  tof_ind_11_desc: "Lets time these so that when we throw them they tick for just a few seconds, bring a little fear into the hearts of the shit bags we are fighting right before we blow their faces off!"

  tof_raiders_of_the_lost_vault_desc: "Fuck those snotty little pacifists! YOU HAVE GUNS, USE THEM! God damn idiots...."
  tof_heading_to_jericho: "Heading to Jericho"
  tof_heading_to_jericho_desc: "Marianne thought to herself as she sat upon the riches of Esmeralda and Nevada -.. \"I am rich enough now that I could, if I really wanted, take back Jericho from the shit heel fuck faces who wronged me back then.\". For Marianne it wouldn't take much to convince her subordinate raiders to fight for her. She had already gotten them this rich, after all."
  tof_psh_wg: "Beep Boop You Die Now"

  tof_ves: "Ves Wisdom"

  tof_city_318: "City 318'"
  tof_city_318_desc: "City 318 was a strange model for a potential 'future city', a above-ground vault that was housed with the latest in state of the art infrastructure.. At least, by the time the bombs fell. Two hundred years later and the \"Fabled\" City 318 isn't much different then any other dirt pile in the wasteland."
  tof_crescent_valley: "Crescent Valley Treasures"
  tof_crescent_valley_desc: "It turns out that Crescent Valley was a rather rich little valley, a town that sustains itself through agriculture and crops! We can enslave the settlers here and have them make food for us -.. that, and 'maybe' eventually they can teach us a thing or two."
  tof_ind_8: "Cool Hats"
  tof_ind_8_desc: "Check out this one! Isn't it fashionable!?"
  tof_ind_9: "Cross Utah-Nevada Raider Conscription"
  tof_ind_9_desc: "As we expand further the nature of our conflicts are changing, moving from simple petty gang fights and moving into proper planned conflict. If we are expected to field so many troops across various raids we need to begin a larger conscription effort!"
  tof_eighties: "Slugfest for Jericho"
  tof_eighties_desc: "The Eighties aren't a threat to underestimate. This isn't going to be a raid for fun, or a war for profit - this is a proper slugfest, pure and simple."
  tof_white_legs: "Restoring the Happy Trails Caravan Route"
  tof_white_legs_desc: "It might be weird for Raiders to go up and 'do something good', but the White Legs have been a major regional problem in eastern Utah for quite a while. The Happy Trails company has been complaining that the White Legs have been raiding Utah's caravans, and have played a role in the degradation of Jericho as a settlement. Lets wipe them out!"
  tof_ind_10: "Profiting from the Drug Trade"
  tof_ind_10_desc: "Before, when we were a small gang we participated in drugs mostly.. as consumers. Now that we are a bit larger we can properly take advantage of the drug trade not ONLY as consumers, but ALSO as suppliers!"
  tof_gold_hill: "Riches of Gold Hill"
  tof_gold_hill_desc: "In our gang some of Marianne's boys are actually wanting to settle down in Gold Hill, mostly off of rumours of raw gold being found somewhere in here. If they want to settle down and make a life for themselves away from raiding.. why stop them?"
  tof_coast_of_the_salt_lake: "The Coast of the Salt Lake"
  tof_coast_of_the_salt_lake_desc: "Its been some time since Marianne has been here. At one point in her life Marianne thought that she would have never have seen these waters again. For her, it felt nice."
  tof_tar: "Warriors of the Tar"
  tof_tar_desc: "At one point we might have had fun taking out the Tar Walkers -.. but really? Now its just kind of sad. The Tar Walkers, a sickly sort of tribals have been through a lot. Hopefully by taking control of the region we can try to put a stop to the disease spreading through their lands."
  tof_frisco: "Frisco's Riches"
  tof_frisco_desc: "Frisco was one of the earlier cities of which was raided by the White Legs. They left behind some real treasures here, things that an experienced group of Raiders would have missed easily. Water pump supplies, artisan tools, construction materials. We could really put this stuff to use!"
  tof_lincoln: "Lincoln Calls Us Saviours"
  tof_lincoln_desc: "The slaves of Lincoln, ironically enough, have practically become smitten with us after our conquest of Lincoln. Seeing us as liberators against the tyranny of the White Legs.\nNobody has ever really seen us as 'good guys' before... Sort of kills the thrill of raiding a bit, doesn't it?"
  tof_clk: "Finishing Up the Happy Trails Route"
  tof_clk_desc: "There is one last group that is holding a bit of the old Happy Trails Route - outside of New Canaan itself, of course. Lets clean this up!"
  tof_the_walls_of_jericho_fell: "The Walls of Jericho"
  tof_the_walls_of_jericho_fell_desc: "Marianne thought she would never be back here. At one point in her life, she may have wanted to burn this place to the ground for what the people here did to her... But now? She can see that there are many people still here suffering just as she did. Marianne can do something 'good' with the wealth she has earned in her raids and plunder, why not take that step?"
  tof_union_station: "Union Station"
  tof_union_station_desc: "When Marianne was young this is where she came into Jericho, decades ago this place used to be a bustling destination for traders across Utah.. Now? There is little more to it then the metal in the sand."
  tof_lines_in_the_sand: "Lines in the Sand"
  tof_lines_in_the_sand_desc: "Its hard to say how long these rails go on for, some say if you follow them for long enough you can find the §Rbigshots§! in charge of all of this."
  tof_riches_of_trade: "Riches of Trade"
  tof_riches_of_trade_desc: "Jericho used to be such a rich city, before the Hands of God built a stranglehold on trade here and the Eighties destroyed the water plant. Perhaps we can recover a bit of that trade?"
  tof_the_great_water_plant: "Jericho's Water Plant"
  tof_the_great_water_plant_desc: "It feels like with Jericho we are grasping at the past.. but isn't that what everyone is doing anyway? Our boys can take a few months off of their raids to help repair the old water plant - the lifeblood of this town."
  tof_repairing_hands_of_god_damage: "Scars from the Hands of God"
  tof_repairing_hands_of_god_damage_desc: "The Hands of God were a small Christian raider gang emanating from New Canaan - rumour has it under the payroll of Rigdon himself. They used the supposed \"sin\" of Jericho to ransack the place and install martial law. They left some pretty deep wounds in the community, lets see if we can mend them!"
  tof_repairing_eighties_damage: "Tracks of the Eighties"
  tof_repairing_eighties_damage_desc: "The Eighties, when they uprooted most of the Hands from this town may have - in part - worked to save the original 215th Chain Gangers from our imprisonment on behalf of the Hands of God, but in truth they never had good intent with Jericho. In recent years they have used this place for little more then dirt-bike racing."
  tof_utahs_great_resevoir: "The Great Reservoir"
  tof_utahs_great_resevoir_desc: "Its been some time since the water plant has been this good! It seems that the 215th really can do some good if they put their minds to it."
  tof_the_hands_of_god: "Hands of God Remnants"
  tof_the_hands_of_god_desc: "It seems that the Eighties didn't wipe out all of the Hands of God. There are still some resistance cells hiding out.\nThey aren't likely to be friendly.."
  tof_uprooting_resistance_cells: "Uprooting Resistance Cells"
  tof_uprooting_resistance_cells_desc: "For some of our trigger-happy boys it felt good to give them an outlet. A real chance to shoot up some bad guys - the resistance cells of the Hands of God are perfect for that!"
  tof_finding_their_hideouts: "Finding Their Hideouts"
  tof_finding_their_hideouts_desc: "Its going to take some time to find all of the Hands' little outposts here in Jericho. Eventually, with enough work we can uproot them all though!"
  tof_jericho_restored: "Jericho Restored"
  tof_jericho_restored_desc: "Marianne's mother would be proud to see what she has done for this place, ultimately. She took fate by the balls and made her own future, fuck yeah!"
  tof_repair_the_snake_river_canal: "Repairing the Snake River Canal"
  tof_repair_the_snake_river_canal_desc: "In the 2050's, Utah's Salt Lake was at a rather reduced level due to global atmospheric changes. Some forgotten inventor had the bright idea to make a canal stretching from the Salt Lake to the Snake River - known as the 'Snake River Canal' today. Its been a while since someone has done repair work on this - lets see if we can bring it to working order!"
  tof_ncn: "Origins of the Hands of God"
  tof_ncn_desc: "In our fight against the Hands we have gathered sufficient evidence pointing to New Canaan as the primary contractor of the Hands. While we cannot link it to Rigdon personally just yet the evidence we do have is enough that our boys are getting somewhat jumpy with letting New Canaan linger on our border. Lets wipe them out - those traders have done enough bad for this region anyway."
  tof_a_cafe_of_broken_dreams: "A Cafe of Broken Dreams"
  tof_a_cafe_of_broken_dreams_desc: "If there was anything Marianne wanted to be when she was younger it was simply the chance to be a star, to be the sort of woman 'she chose' and not to let anyone else decide her fate. She has had some hardships, but with enough of her personal loot and blunder available it seems she finally has a good chance of achieving this dream - a little plot of land close by seeming just the perfect place to open a little diner. A place of refuge, for everyone out there whom fate gave a bad hand."
  TOF_CAFE_BROKEN_DREAMS: "Cafe of Broken Dreams"
  cafe_manager: "Magnificent Cafe Hostess"
  tof_grand_raider_council: "A Council for Raider's Everywhere"
  tof_grand_raider_council_desc: "You know, maybe the only thing separating a raider from anyone else is just being given a bad hand in life. People treat us like monsters, a \"They hate us because they ain't us\" sort of mindset. Perhaps we can change that, show the world that anyone can rise up in society if they are just strong enough. A message of solidarity to raiders broken and mad everywhere!"
