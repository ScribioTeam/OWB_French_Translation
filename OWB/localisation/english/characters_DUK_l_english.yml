  DUK_MOUNTIE_NAME:0 "William Tanner"
  DUK_MOUNTIE_DESC:0 "When the King calls it is William Tanner who answers first. He leads the rangers of the mountain park wherever and whenever they are needed to protect the Kingdom. While allowed to command his forces as he sees fit, Tanner is still almost entirely dependent on the crown for supplies and weapons. Where other men might chafe under these conditions, Tanner is a man of strong loyalties and pride in his duty. Duck Mountain stands for the King."
