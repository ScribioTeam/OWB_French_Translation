The slaughter began as soon as the world ended; unfeeling monsters made entirely of armour conquered all in their path. They came from the earth, from factories that toiled tirelessly between the roots of civilisation: immense metal machines, calculating and innumerable. The synthetic invasion began the day the bombs fell, as if they heralded the coming of a greater being.\n\nTheir arrival was foretold in the prophecies, by our ancestors of centuries past. We followed the instructions they left to us, reconstructing the strange machines depicted in the carved stone diagrams. When the great device was finished, and the switch was flipped, a brave volunteer found himself lost in a sea of green. When he opened his eyes, he was standing in an ancient replica of our device, flanked on all sides by three towering statues. Past their inert silhouettes, he saw an astonishing arsenal of weapons from across space and time. Yet as our warrior stepped forth to claim them, the three statues cracked, and from within the stone burst forth a trio of men with vigour! Our warriors are unaccustomed to wielding these strange weapons, and are weary of our newly discovered ancient ancestors, but they must adapt quickly if we are to defend humanity from Tlaloc’s menace!

Behind him, a woman. The man paused, blinking as if to adjust to the dull light of the Vault, before his eyes slowly surveyed his landing ground. Obviously confused, he ventured a question: \"You wouldn't happen to know if this is Crespallion, would you?\". Overwatch Tock offered no reply. Instead, Tock slowly reached for his weapon, placed on the desk in front of him. \"Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you\", the man from the box exclaimed. \"You see, I'm the Doctor. I'm a Time Lord.
