  mtc_choosing_our_national_heros:0 "Choosing our National Heros"
  mtc_choosing_our_national_heros_desc:0 "Our long and storied past gives us many tales to tell to our younger generations that do not know of the struggles the Métis once went through. Who will be our symbol of hope? The persistent Louis Riel or the great warrior Gabriel Dumont?"
  mtc_teachings_of_louis_riel:0 "The Teachings of Louis Riel"
  mtc_teachings_of_louis_riel_desc:0 "The great politician and diplomat Louis Riel was a symbol of hope for our people and formed the first National Committee that fought for our rights in the Red River Resistance. He had tried time and time again to get proper treatment for our people but was ultimately executed due to his trial being a political circus. However we still carry his ideals far further than any Canadian has carried theirs."
  mtc_poverty_programs:0 "Open our Borders"
  mtc_poverty_programs_desc:0 "For too long have we closed our borders to outsiders, if we truly want to carry on the memory of Riel then we must be accepting of our neighbours. To prove we are not hypocrites we must treat them as fairly as we treat our own people. This may cause tension amongst hard liners but it's for the greater good of the Congress."
  mtc_susbsidized_essentials:0 "Legacy of The Medicine Line"
  mtc_susbsidized_essentials_desc:0 "The Medicine line split hundreds of families from their loved ones once it was enforced. An arbitrary border that split some of our people in two and lead to the rights of our tribe being ignored across the border. Let us reunite with some of the tribes south of the line to find kinship once more."
  mtc_expansive_defintion_of_metis:0 "Expansive Definition of Métis"
  mtc_expansive_defintion_of_metis_desc:0 "Over the centuries the true identity of the Métis has been put into question by cynics. What does it truly mean to be one of us? Perhaps we should expand our tolerance towards whoever wishes to identify as a member of our people due to their legacy."
  mtc_reconcile_with_anglo_metis:0 "Support New World Tribes"
  mtc_reconcile_with_anglo_metis_desc:0 "While our people have conflicted with other tribes in the past it is best to put our best foot forward in this desolate wasteland. Instead of shunning and sparking conflict with these tribes that evolved from different situations let us embrace them with open arms in diplomacy."
  mtc_the_wasteland_metis:0 "The Wasteland Makes Métis of Us All"
  mtc_the_wasteland_metis_desc:0 "Bringing forward the ideals of our ancestors has brought us into a new age of acceptance and excellence. Now thousands more embrace their true past and the teachings of Riel. Glory to the Congress! Long live the memory of Louis Riel!"
  mtc_actions_of_gabriel_dumont:0 "The Actions of Gabriel Dumont"
  mtc_actions_of_gabriel_dumont_desc:0 "Gabriel Dumont was a great warrior who fought in countless battles against the countless enemies of the Métis. Unlike his contemporary counterparts he was swift to act against the droves that wanted us dead. Let us light the hearts of our young ones with the tale of the greatest General to ever live."
  mtc_restrictive_definiton_of_metis:0 "Restrictive Definition of Métis"
  mtc_restrictive_definiton_of_metis_desc:0 "The wasteland is a harsh place, and our troubles have been far from few. To close the definition of what can be or what is Métis would allow us to focus more on ourselves, instead of the outside world and those outside of our demesne."
  mtc_metisization:0 "Métis National Council"
  mtc_metisization_desc:0 "Many new-age tribes have found themselves in our vicinity and are being oppressed by outside forces like we once were. Instead of letting them simmer out and die like countless before them let's give them our guns and grenades!"
  mtc_foundations_of_civilization:0 "The Foundations of Civilization"
  mtc_foundations_of_civilization_desc:0 "Any civilization, given enough time and power, should be able to sustain itself properly without riding off of hopes that outsiders will help. We have always been resourceful ever since the days of fur trading and should never rely on anyone but ourselves."
  mtc_expand_the_metis_works:0 "Expand the Métis Works"
  mtc_expand_the_metis_works_desc:0 "We have long been craftsmen and traders but now-a-days our resources have started running dry. Let's try to embrace self sustainability by funding the construction of sawmills and trading posts all across the nation."
  mtc_forged_in_fire:0 "Forged in the Fires of History"
  mtc_forged_in_fire_desc:0 "The Métis have been beaten down and defeated countless times, the fact our culture still exists is a testament to our strength. We were forged in the fires of history and never intend on having the legacy of being a dimly lit flame, instead we'll go out with a blaze."
  mtc_restrain_the_unbound:0 "Restrain the Unbound"
  mtc_restrain_the_unbound_desc:0 "The Unbound to our south have skirmished with our border forces endless times. Instead of letting them sack and pillage our countryside let us restrain the so called unrestrainable. Raiders have no place in our congress."

  mtc_an_end_to_the_madness_desc:0 "An endless flurry of madness plagues our western side, the time has come to deal with it. On one hand there are the Snowmads and their roaring snowmobiles. On the other the Mad Trains and their completely insane coalition of questionably related maniacs. Both must cease to exist."
