  nf_tdt.2.d:0 "The break came when the Mayan leaders of [ITZ.GetCapital] declared the birth of a Mayan empire. To the people of [TDT.GetName], this was absurd. In a world struggling to rebuild from the Great War, the only thing they would be kings of were the ashes.

  nf_tdt.5.t:0 "The Enemy of Our Enemy"
  nf_tdt.5.d:0 "Our greatest rivals, [ITZ.GetNameDef] have declared war on [TDT.GetName]. The escalation comes after [TDT.GetName]'s Sajal, Tobias Rey II, defeated the Itza's sponsored candidate, Maximo Vela, in hand-to-hand combat, following Vela's challenge for the leadership of [TDT.GetName]. Seeing that they now have no chance for for a peaceful integration of the territory, the Itza have opted for an all-out invasion. Following the declaration of war, the shrewd Sajal Rey has called in various favours from a wide range of important aristocrats in our Empire, requesting any support that can be given. As a result, an influential group of aristocrats has begun lobbying [ATE.GetLeader] to help [TDT.GetName] in any way possible. One of the possibilities it to send one of our best generals, Christian Gallo, along with 1000 of our most recent weapons to assist their cause. Or we could leave [TDT.GetName] to their fate..."

  nf_tdt.7.d:0 "The Itza is in flames, and we have one more chance at freedom. Paralysed by the Kalomte's recent critical injury, the court and army of the Itzan Empire has begin to crumble under the pressure of its empire. Recent clashes between the Itza and Aztlan have been overwhelming Aztlan victories, and rumor has it Xma' Su'tal Maskab Hatsik itself is coming under threat from the Petro Chicans to the north. It seems that Itzan protection may no longer be in our interest, and in that spirit the elders of Tzotzil have decided to appoint Tobias Rey once more to lead the country forwards. Whilst the Itza may be unable to react to this declaration now, they'll be sure to come back later..."
