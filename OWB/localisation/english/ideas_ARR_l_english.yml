  Whoz_DESC:0 "An intelligent supermutant, Whoz rose to prominence after his capture by NCR forces. While they had originally planned to execute him, a small band of Max Sec officers offered to pay for him in exchange. Since his time in Max Sec began, Whoz has led a prominent gang of supermutants from inside the prison walls. However, unlike most of the other supermutants in Max Sec, Whoz has maintained a decent standing amongst other human prisoners. This trait paid off following his escape from the prison, as his ability to negotiate with rival gangs allowed him to form a larger army. For now, Whoz is the de facto leader of the area. That could change at any minute however, as the former criminals of Max Sec were never known for their loyalty."
