  SHI_NORTON_DESC:0 "Although Norton rules over a land which is not his own, he wishes for it's prosperity nonetheless. Teleported here by cosmic forces unknown to him, for purposes even more unknown, he faces everyday as if this was always the life he lived. Because if he doesn't succeed than the entire wasteland will have no hope left and that cannot be allowed to happen. Though this is not the America he knows, it's still the America he is in and it is his duty to his people to fight against the decay of the world."
