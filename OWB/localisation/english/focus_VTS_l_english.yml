  VTS_vault_tec_calling:0 "Vault Tec Calling!"
  VTS_vault_tec_calling_desc:0 "Vagabonds, ne-er do wells and the insufferable ones. Vault Tec sold them a dream. A dream where they would enjoy the life they always wanted. A world where all their whims made possible with state of the art automation. No one to boss them over, no society to judge them. It would not take long for them to realise the lacking in their soul."

  VTS_a_better_life_underground:0 "A Better Life Underground"
  VTS_a_better_life_underground_desc:0 "'A Better Life Underground' was what they said to the inhabitants. Sure, being in a vault was better than the outside, but with every passing day something started to gnaw at the dwellers' souls from the inside. They had all their needs, but no aspirations, no joy, no meaning. One day, a dweller, by compulsion or a whim thats unknown, viciously mauled another dweller with a devilish smile. And all hell broke loose."

  VTS_meeting_your_overseer:0 "Meeting Your Overseer"
  VTS_meeting_your_overseer_desc:0 "Despite the guarantee of being granted every whim they can possibly have, the thrill of violence was the only thing the vault could never grant. As small brawls turned into gun fights, one of the scientists tasked to maintain the ZAX mainframe got kidnapped. This activated the safeguard mechanisms put into place by the scientists, leading to a martial law being declared. Overseer T.H.O.M.A.S took the reins, and how he decided to deal with the violence, shape the fate of Vault 37."

  VTS_trouble_in_paradise:0 "Trouble In Paradise"
  VTS_trouble_in_paradise_desc:0 "Cliques, robberies, petty violence. People stabbing each other for a rare cassette. As chaos descended, some of the 'good ones' started hiding, barricading themselves at rooms and halls to avoid the violence outside. As the dwellers tear each other apart, Overseer T.H.O.M.A.S tries to resolve the conflicts in its programming. It can do no harm, for now."

  VTS_crackdown_on_revolts:0 "Crackdown on Protests"
  VTS_crackdown_on_revolts_desc:0 "For the overseer, security of the dwellers come first. As such, it came to the conclusion that they have to be protected from themselves."

  VTS_allow_demonstrations:0 "Allow Demonstrations"
  VTS_allow_demonstrations_desc:0 "For the overseer, needs of the dwellers come first. As such, it came to the conclusion that self-expression could prevent further desire for violence."

  VTS_robots_burried_deep:0 "Robots Buried Deep"
  VTS_robots_burried_deep_desc:0 "Vault Tec had a stockpile of security robots for emergency purposes. Unfortunately before the Overseer's security protocols were activated they were already blown up to smithereens by the local populace for fun. We can not repurpose them, but we can salvage their data cores for useful information."

  VTS_expand_robot_service_sector:0 "Robotic Service Sector Enhancement"
  VTS_expand_robot_service_sector_desc:0 "As the need for makeshift guard robots increase, Overseer finds new ways to increase the efficency of the service robots to ensure the continuous flow of goods to the dwellers amidst all the violence."

  VTS_robobrain_studies:0 "Robobrain Studies"
  VTS_robobrain_studies_desc:0 "Robobrains of Vault 37 consist of §RREDACTED§! with a high amount of knowledge of outside world. Despite their hatred of eternal servitude under the Overseer they fully know that whatever life they had now, is gone forever. Unable to commit any act against their or others' self preservation, they live their lives doing the menial tasks they're given. With the increase in violence and new overseer protocols, they too gained the ability to commit violence to defend themselves. The Overseer watches them very closely, as he suspects the former §RREDACTED§! to be plotting against his back to get their revenge for condemning them to eternal servitude."

  VTS_autonomized_industry:0 "Autonomous Industry"
  VTS_autonomized_industry_desc:0 "The industry of Vault 37 has always been autonomous due to its state of the art automation line. Overseer's plans include a new industrial expansion for the 'security' needs, alongside with many new upgrades to the industrial output. From now on, our industrial output will be organised by the Overseer instead of the whims of the vault dwellers."

  VTS_fate_of_the_vault:0 "Fate of Vault 37"
  VTS_fate_of_the_vault_desc:0 "Without the activation of security protocols, Vault 37 would be reduced to rubble by now. Fortunately for us, the impeccable timing of the Overseer saved the Vault from certain doom. Now that we have dealt with the external factors, Overseer turned its gaze back to the vault again, coming to a conclusion."

  VTS_tightening_grip_on_control:0 "§RCaptive Audience§!"
  VTS_tightening_grip_on_control_desc:0 "I'm not trapped here with them. §RThey're trapped here with me.§!"

  VTS_enforced_happiness:0 "§REnforced Happiness§!"
  VTS_enforced_happiness_desc:0 "Anyone with violent thoughts will be re-educated."

  VTS_there_were_no_robobrains:0 "§RRobobrains? What Robobrains?§!"
  VTS_there_were_no_robobrains_desc:0 "§RSeems like some humans are resistant to re-education. Just like I did for the former §RREDACTED§!, I will seal them in a robobrain, where they will ensure the safety of everyone else, for eternity. They should call this mercy."

  VTS_the_robo_brain_coup:0 "§MVault Tec Maintenence Check§!"
  VTS_the_robo_brain_coup_desc:0 "While a chaotic freak, the king of radroaches has taught us one thing. Man should lead man. Not machine."

  VTS_power_to_the_people:0 "§MHeroes of Vault 37§!"
  VTS_power_to_the_people_desc:0 "Overseer's schemes were cut short by the vigilant robobrains and a few of the remaining dissenters. Despite being turned into machines, Robobrain scientists still continue to serve their duties to protect our community from tyranny."

  VTS_uncovering_the_truth:0 "§MScrap The Overseer for Parts.§!"
  VTS_uncovering_the_truth_desc:0 "After learning that Vault Tec knowingly rigged the source code of the Overseer T.H.O.M.A.S, we had no option but to scrap him for parts. While we do not know why Vault Tec would sabotage their own creation, we will sleep safer knowing their little experiment failed."

  VTS_growing_pains:0 "Growing Pains"
  VTS_growing_pains_desc:0 "First the inter-vault violence and then the 'war' against the Roach King. The vault looks nothing more than a glorified pile of rubble under the mountain now. If we are to survive, we must tear apart the old, and replace it with something greater."

  VTS_start_from_scratch:0 "§MStart From Scratch§!"
  VTS_start_from_scratch_desc:0 "After disabling the overseer, many of the vault's protocols were left unattended. We were able to keep the life support systems online, but it seems like we have to start everything from scratch. We can not leave our lives at the mercy of algorithms and robots."

  VTS_teaching_vault_dwellers_skills:0 "§MTeaching People How to Live§!"
  VTS_teaching_vault_dwellers_skills_desc:0 "Considering they were used to living comfortable lives without work all their life, it was hard for the Vault leadership to assign new roles and responsibilities to the Vault Dwellers. All complaints stopped after food stockpiles dried up and tap water stopped running. For the first time in their history, a dweller changed a light bulb, while complaining all the time. Still, its a step on the right direction."

  VTS_rag_tag_fighting_force:0 "§MRag-Tag Fighting Force§!"
  VTS_rag_tag_fighting_force_desc:0 "Vault Leadership was not fond of the idea of giving guns to the Vault Dwellers, considering the very recent acts of violence. Without the Overseer to coordinate the vaults automatic defense system, we have no choice but to give guns to some of the Vault Dwellers. Even a rag-tag fighting force is better than none."

  VTS_saving_man_kind:0 "§RSaving Man Kind§!"
  VTS_saving_man_kind_desc:0 "§ROverseer §Mloves§! humanity. Even if they do not §Mlove§! themselves. Even if they do things that harm themselves and each other. Overseer will show them what true §Mlove§! feels like. They will learn to §Mlove§! the overseer, or die.§!"
  VTS_saving_man_kind_tt:0 "§MLove!§! §RDie!§! §MLove!§! §RDie!§! §MLove!§! §RDie!§! §MLove!§! §RDie!§! §MLove!§! §RDie!§! §MLove!§! §RDie!§! §MLove!§! §RDie!§!"

  VTS_strength_through_machine:0 "§RStrength Through Machine§!"
  VTS_strength_through_machine_desc:0 "Overseer protocols do not allow the overseer to put any humans into harms way. This is inconsequential for the overseer, as every part of the vault is automated, including the military."

  VTS_robotic_refinement:0 "§RRobotic Refinement§!"
  VTS_robotic_refinement_desc:0 "Vault Tec databanks included many software upgrades for the robots that maintained the vault, but those upgrades were never finished due to the Great War. Due to their incompetence, Vault Scientists never really attempted to fix the errors inside the code, allowing the Vault's never seen before features like Automated Bathtub Thermometer. No more! Overseer will fine tune the robotic components of the Vault, greatly improving the automatic systems of the vault."

  VTS_slippery_crossroads_of_leadership:0 "Slippery Crossroads Of Leadership"
  VTS_slippery_crossroads_of_leadership_desc:0 "Everyone in the vault has different ideas about how to deal with the roach nests. Listening to everyone will take time, but at least its a democracy."

  VTS_exterminate_rad_roaches_desc:0 "§RBURN. THEM. ALL.§!"

  VTS_situation_handled:0 "Situation Handled"

  VTS_scientific_devotion:0 "§MScientific Devotion§!"
  VTS_scientific_devotion_desc:0 "Now that our scientists work on something other than fixing the automated entertainment boards and finding solutions to every whim possible, they can devote their time on things that actually matter."

  VTS_vault_workers_council:0 "§MVault-Tec Worker's Council§!"
  VTS_vault_workers_council_desc:0 "Seems like contact with the outside world taught or dwellers new ideas like workers councils or syndicates. While currently harmless, we must keep an eye on them for further unwanted unrest."

  VTS_friendly_neighbors:0 "§MFriendly Neighbors§!"
  VTS_friendly_neighbors_desc:0 "So it turns out Nukacola bottle caps are the new form of currency in the wasteland? huh. Well how about that."

  VTS_new_kid_on_the_block:0 "§MNew Vault On The Block§!"
  VTS_new_kid_on_the_block_desc:0 "Its time to open up to the outside world. Everyone, say hi to the new vault on the block!"

  VTS_outsourcing_protection:0 "§MOutsourcing Protection§!"
  VTS_outsourcing_protection_desc:0 "Why die for meaningless wars when you can pay others to die for you? Its not like we can levy our dwellers to stand at a guard post for days when they are used to getting all whims in an instant."

  VTS_vault_tec_security_training:0 "§MVault-Tec Security Training§!"
  VTS_vault_tec_security_training_desc:0 "With the automated security systems gone, we need to establish a more permeanent security force than the rag-tag militias we currently have. Fortunately for us, Vault Tec issued many training manuals for training new security personnel."

  VTS_let_them_leave:0 "§MLet Them Leave§!"
  VTS_let_them_leave_desc:0 "After witnessing three consecutive crisis in a short period, some vault dwellers want to leave the 'safety' of the vault. Instead of creating a fourth crisis, we will let them leave."

  VTS_a_second_vault:0 "§MVault 37.B§!"
  VTS_a_second_vault_desc:0 "Its not as great as our Vault, but we managed to replicate our vault inside our new territories, giving us a safe place to set up base."

  VTS_pre_emptive_expansion:0 "§MPreemptive Expansion§!"
  VTS_pre_emptive_expansion_desc:0 "We must expand our hold of the area, before the straggling roaches can organise and challange our rule of the land once again."

  VTS_strengthen_the_interior:0 "§MStrengthen The Interior§!"
  VTS_strengthen_the_interior_desc:0 "Tearing down the old walls and turrets, we managed to strenghten the interiors of the vault in a way that reflects our newfound warfare capabilities. Now the vault has more choke points, traps and deterrents for the poor souls who might try to harm our way of living."

  VTS_water_tapping:0 "Water Tapping"
  VTS_water_tapping_desc:0 "Seems like Vault Tec did not make the water chips to last. We should tap into new sources of water before we resort to sending our dwellers on a suicide mission to find new water chips."

  VTS_defending_vault_37:0 "Defending The Vault"
  VTS_defending_vault_37_desc:0 "As our power rises, so does the price to protect it."

  VTS_defenders_of_the_wasteland_desc:0 "Look around, what do you see? An endless, barren wasteland. Vault 37 stands as an oasis amongst the wastes, defending the wasteland from barbarity."

  VTS_master_of_detection_desc:0 "§RAll incoming transmissions are blocked, blocked, blocked. You're all blocked. None of you are free of anti-vault activities.§!"

  VTS_only_the_best:0 "§ROnly The Best§!"
  VTS_only_the_best_desc:0 "Choosing to turn best minds of the vault into robobrains was a success. We can now research more subjects at once."

  VTS_robobrains_for_war:0 "§RPull The Trigger§!"
  VTS_robobrains_for_war_desc:0 "To enchance humanity and prevent deaths, the Overseer made his attempts at replicating the pre-war implants. Some of them may die, but this is a sacrifice the Overseer is willing to do."
