  ARR_karma_category: "The Council of Arroyo"
  ARR_karma_category_desc: "The §YChosen One§! created the Council of Arroyo from three key members of the community. Nagor, his young cousin and strong warrior, Dimitri, an experienced doctor from San Francisco educated by the Followers, and Chitsa, a keen and cunning trader and leader.\n\nWhile each leader has their own way of viewing the world, their actions reflect on their §Ginner being§!. Their deeds, both good and bad, reveal a deeper nature and portray the following karma:\n\n§YNagor§! is perceived to be [nagor_karma_visual]§YChitsa§! is best described as [chitsa_karma_visual]§YDimitri§! is considered [dimitri_karma_visual]"

  ARR_chosen_one_category: "Arroyo's Chosen One"
  ARR_chosen_one_category_desc: "The Chosen One is Arroyo's hero. Nearly singlehandedly having saved their tribe from starvation and the Enclave, nearly every adult and child worships the ground the Chosen One walks on.\n\nBut the wastes still call to the Chosen One, and they know that there is business yet unfinished for them outside the bounds of Arroyo...\n\nThe §YChosen One§!'s karma is [chosen_karma_visual]"

  ARR_foreign_policy_category: "Our Blessed Land"
  ARR_foreign_policy_category_desc: "As much as we may wish otherwise, we know well enough that we aren't alone. While Arroyo was once at the mercy of foreign powers, nothing could be further from the truth now. We have a duty to protect our neighbours, but we owe our own people even more.\n\nHigher §Minfluence§! increases the likelihood of a peaceful resolution to a crisis, while higher §Mcoercion§! strengthens our ability to strong-arm our neighbours. Failing to accumulate enough of either will prevent any peaceful outcome.\n\nIf 40% coercion or influence is held over a country it can safely be considered as overcome by Arroyo. Overcome nations will have the best outcomes for Arroyo at the end of their respective crises. However, it is never clear when exactly that crisis will end, so it may be worthwhile to pursue short-term objectives while sacrificing coercion or influence. \n\n§YArroyo will§! §Gnever§! §Ylose out on an expansion target due to low coercion/influence, but will gain §Gadditional benefits§! for having >40% of both§!!\n\nMax Sec Influence: [?arr_mxs_influence|%Y0]\nMax Sec Coercion: [?arr_mxs_coercion|%Y0]\n\nUmbra Influence: [?arr_umb_influence|%Y0]\nUmbra Coercion: [?arr_umb_coercion|%Y0]\n\nPackers Influence: [?arr_pac_influence|%Y0]\nPackers Coercion: [?arr_pac_coercion|%Y0]\n\nEureka Influence: [?arr_eur_influence|%Y0]\nEureka Coercion: [?arr_eur_coercion|%Y0]\n\nFourways Influence: [?arr_fou_influence|%Y0]\nFourways Coercion: [?arr_fou_coercion|%Y0]"

  ARR_fourways_category_desc: "In the competition for domination over [FOU.GetName], there are two paths available to us. The first is through building §Mcoercion§!, which will eventually result in a military campaign against our target. This will, of course, enrage our competition, as well as possibly provoke some level of military response.\nA more peaceful, but perhaps less satisfying, route can be taken through gaining §Minfluence§! in [FOU.GetName]'s merchant guild. Whichever power holds a higher level of influence over [FOU.GetName] will have the upper hand in negotiations, allowing them to force their opposition into accepting disadvantageous agreements.\n\nArroyo's Influence: [?ARR.arr_fou_influence|%Y0]\nArroyo's Coercion: [?ARR.arr_fou_coercion|%Y0]\n\nThe NCR's Influence: [?NCR.arr_fou_influence|%Y0]\nThe NCR's Coercion: [?NCR.arr_fou_coercion|%Y0]"
