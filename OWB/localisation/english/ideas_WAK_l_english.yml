 cpf_sanatorium_at_birch_hills_desc:0 "There exists a hospital in Birch Hills, one that is surrounded by mystery. It houses the chronically addicted, the wayward, and the mentally unstable. But for a group of Genius Doctors and Super Mutants, it's home. A place to cure and be cured. A place where Super Mutants are cared for, Ghouls are employed, and Death Claws are the goodest boys. But all these sickly beings put immense strain on the Doctors and Nurses, who barely have enough time to sleep, let alone handle large scale country-wide logistics."
