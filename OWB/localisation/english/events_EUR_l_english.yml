  nf_eureka.0.d:0 "The nuclear devastation that awaited Eureka was avoided, but at a great cost. The missile was off target, and instead slammed into the waters outside the city's port. While the radiation effects alone were enough to kill or incapacitate many, the horrors that emerged from the diseased sea were nearly extraterrestrial. Worst of all, Eureka had survived primarily through fishing and trading through its port, making even the existence of these mutated creatures a threat to their survival. The Portmasters held together in this time, a local militia which protected us all. Under the Portmasters' guidance, we learned - "

  nf_eureka.1.t:0 "A Regulated Industry"
  nf_eureka.1.d:0 "There is an old Eurekan saying - 'peace is good for business; war is good for business.'  The crew from Eureka's marina took control of the town after the bombs fell.  But the lands around Eureka were too poor, and too lightly populated, to rule anyone. Why bother? Instead, the marina began offering themselves out for 'protection'. A season campaigning, then a return home for the winter. In a mere generation they were known as the Portmasters, a rough and ready band. \n\nBut the Portmasters had their limitations. Eureka lacked heavy weaponry or advanced schematics, and faced the chance of falling behind. And so in 2150, a new gang came to Eureka.  \n\nThe Regulators were once the heroes of the Boneyard, a militia company who kept the town safe. But in 2141 the Vault Dweller, corrupted by the honeyed words of local raiders, turned the town against them. The men and women who fought and died to keep one of California's first towns safe fled as far as they could go, looking for a home.  And they found one in Eureka.  To quote Caleb, 'this is a good and peaceful place - here I shall rest my gun above the mantle.' "
  nf_eureka.1.a:0 "They brought special forces training."
  nf_eureka.1.b:0 "They taught us how to hold a position."
  nf_eureka.1.c:0 "We learned how to live off the land."

  nf_eureka.2.t:0 "The Turning Wheel"
  nf_eureka.2.d:0 "The Regulators weren't the only Californians to flee to Eureka, seeking a better life.  Beginning in the 2240s, the Hubologists walked north, seeking a land free of the Shi's persecution. \n\nThe Hubologists are called 'con artists' and charlatans, but that is base slander. They believe that life, the universe, and everything  are a turning wheel.  With their scientific beliefs, the children of Dick Hubbell tried to cleanse the Wasteland of the neurodynes that almost destroyed mankind.  But Thrakazog  the Pot Hole stuck our wheel, and his agent from Arroyo drove us out of San Francisco.  To Eureka we came, and Eureka we remain. It is in this little town that the Hubologists work for the Great Uplifting, and to bring us home to the star Father on Quetzel."
  nf_eureka.2.a:0 "Down With the Oppressives!"

  nf_eureka.3.t:0 "Payment Received"
  nf_eureka.3.d:0 "Our volunteers have been sent out and are currently en route to their future hosts. Already, we've received the down payment promised to us. Yet the spoils of war are ever bountiful, and increasing the capabilities of our generals will lead to future spoils."
  nf_eureka.3.a:0 "For Eureka!"

  nf_eureka.4.t:0 "The Spoils of War"
  nf_eureka.4.d:0 "The growing strength of our generals has led to an increase in loot captured while in the field. These spoils have been shipped home to us, enriching our treasury and our people."

  nf_eureka.5.t: "Dubious Prospects"
  nf_eureka.5.d:0 "While our team managed to uncover some usable support equipment, most of what they found was in deep disrepair.

  nf_eureka.6.t: "The Business of Redding is Business"
  nf_eureka.6.d:0 "As Eureka's economy opened, three investors approached the City's leaders with a plan.  \n\n Two twins, Olivia and Cordell, came with their retinues. A battalion of clerks, guards, and builders, behind two unique plans.  Olivia's promise was simple - improve the infrastructure to imprrove exports to New California.  Her brother, a student at Vault City University, proposed looking for gold. After all, Redding once had some, and the region was once the source of gold centuries ago.  Surely some was left?  \n\nBut there was also a third proposal, one that disgusted Granite. A super mutant known only as Francis claimed the super mutants from Broken Hills could use their skills to run the mine. From a strict cost-benefit analysis, the mutants would be an invaluable tool. But hadn't these monsters killed thousands?"
  nf_eureka.6.a:0 "Olivia's solution is practical"
  nf_eureka.6.b:0 "Cordell, sign me up!"
  nf_eureka.6.c:0 "Super mutants can lift *how much*?"

  nf_eureka.7.t: "Who to Approach?"
  nf_eureka.7.d:0 "A war of influence has recently broken out over the small state of [FOU.GetName]. Seemingly insignificant, the area is actually a valuable trading route for caravans traveling from Redding to Arroyo. Both nations would benefit massively from dominating the outpost, and our reputation might be enough to shift the tides towards one of them. Of course, we have no interest in [FOU.GetName]. It's far too remote, and has little value to us. We do, however, stand to benefit from one of the competitor's patronage. We could approach one of them, offering support for their caps."
  nf_eureka.7.a:0 "We should meet with Arroyo"
  nf_eureka.7.b:0 "Send a message to the NCR"

  nf_eureka.8.t: "Eureka Offers Support"
  nf_eureka.8.d:0 "Our campaign for control over Fourways stands to benefit from Eureka's recent offer of diplomatic support. Accepting their offer could go a long ways towards ending the standoff peacefully, but Eureka has made sure to attach a price tag. The mercenaries are force enough in the region to make their offer worth considering, but our advisors are divided on whether it should be outright agreed to, given the caps needed for such a deal."
  nf_eureka.8.a:0 "We graciously accept their proposal."
  nf_eureka.8.b:0 "Eureka? Who is that again?"

  nf_eureka.9.t: "Deal Accepted"
  nf_eureka.9.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has wisely agreed to our proposed plan. Offering them support over the [FOU.GetName] issue has cost us little, but we should be mindful of the changing circumstances in the region. Whoever wins the struggle for [FOU.GetName] might turn their attention towards us next, after all."
  nf_eureka.9.a:0 "A pleasure doing business."

  nf_eureka.10.t: "Deal Declined"
  nf_eureka.10.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] foolishly declined our offer of support. All this has cost us is time and effort, but it is a stinging blow nevertheless."
  nf_eureka.10.a:0 "On to other matters."

  nf_eureka.11.t: "Eureka Offers a Non-aggression Pact"
  nf_eureka.11.d:0 "A messenger from the port city of Eureka has reached Arroyo and seems to be offering a non-aggression pact between our two nations. This would probably be a temporary solution to the growing conflict between our two nations, but it could benefit us to accept this arrangement while we focus on other concerns."
  nf_eureka.11.a:0 "We accept, for now."
  nf_eureka.11.b:0 "No, but you will see us soon"

  nf_eureka.12.t: "Deal Declined"
  nf_eureka.12.d:0 "Arroyo has spurned our reasonable diplomatic gestures. It seems that our estimation of them was completely wrong, and that they do only see us as a future target. We will have to prepare for what is certain to be an oncoming conflict."
  nf_eureka.12.a:0 "Then it is war."

  nf_eureka.13.t: "Eureka's Mercenary Army"
  nf_eureka.13.d: "Eureka works differently from almost any other nation. Instead of a normal standing army they are involved in conflicts across the west coast in exchange for caps and army experience. They cannot train new divisions regularly and have extremely limited industry, but instead raise divisions and equipment through special decisions.\n\nMercenaries can be sent through the Send Volunteers button on the diplomacy screen. Sending mercenaries (so long as the nation does not already have mercenaries from Eureka) results in an automatic payment of 40 caps, and levelling up your starting generals provides an additional payment of 25 caps. Only your starting generals and those gained by focuses and events grant the 25 cap payment.\n\nYou must have a presence in a nation's port in order to send them mercenaries. At game start, Eureka has built a presence from the southern tip of Baja to the Washington Brotherhood's Capitol Hill. Focuses may expand your reach to new ports, and therefore new conflicts."
  nf_eureka.13.a: "I see."

  nf_eureka.14.t: "Too Close to Home"
  nf_eureka.14.d: "The quiet evening was blasted awake by an indescribable explosion at our port in Eureka. The fishermen unloading their boats after a long day of work were killed almost instantly. A ship of mercenaries, returning home on leave and excited to see their families, were suddenly returned to the battlefields they had escaped, with many suffering grievous or fatal wounds. The initial horror began to be replaced by despair, and then rage, as responders found a sickly green murk spreading from nearby the site of the explosion - a clear sign that contaminants had been carefully included in the source of the explosion. This was no mistake, or accident. This was an act of terror."
  nf_eureka.14.a: "Remember this."

  nf_eureka.15.t: "Remains of Expertise"
  nf_eureka.15.d: "Once our response efforts turned from rescue to investigation a number of disturbing facts became clear. First, this was no accident. The port overseers have long been well aware of the Eurekan port's importance to our city, and would never have allowed dangerous material to be stored there. Second, the attack had been carefully planned. We were unable to find any solid leads or any evidence left behind, meaning the planners were professionals. One of our neighbours must be responsible for this, as the contaminants were no doubt deliberately included to damage the port. Between our two greatest threats, the NCR and Arroyo, there is one clear suspect. The NCR is far too preoccupied with the Mojave to turn their attention to us, while Arroyo is practically searching for an excuse to march their armies into our territory."
  nf_eureka.15.a: "They will pay."

  nf_eureka.16.t: "Arroyo Asks For Submission"
  nf_eureka.16.d: "A delegation from Arroyo formally approached Portmaster Smith today, offering him and Eureka a place in an 'Arroyan Confederation', led by Arroyo itself. At face value, this is an insulting question, especially considering our steadfast focus on remaining independent from subjugation. After further discussion, however, it seems that we have much to gain if we agree to their proposal. Arroyo is willing to invest heavily in our land. They would also allow us to maintain our mercenary army, and grant us access to more fishing waters.\n\nIf we do choose to resist, we will be forced to do so violently. Simply declining the offer would lead to a steady erosion of our control, and an eventual de facto takeover. Our continued independence means there must be war."
  nf_eureka.16.a: "Arroyo's offer is reasonable"
  nf_eureka.16.b: "We shall never bow to anyone!"
  nf_eureka.16.c: "We are already under NCR protection"

  nf_eureka.17.t: "Mercenaries, cont."
  nf_eureka.17.d: "In order to see where you can send mercenaries, open the drop-down menu on the top bar (where you would normally find the core state buttons). Look for the §GAdditional Mapmodes§! button near the bottom. Once it's opened change the filter from "Countries" to "Volunteer Targets". All countries in green are valid targets for volunteers. Completing focuses will increase the number of available targets in intervene in."
  nf_eureka.17.a: "Wow, how convenient!"

  nf_eureka.18.t: "HEY! HEY ARADORN!"
  nf_eureka.18.d: "You were just walking around the wasteland and heard someone yelling at you with a name other than yours. Turn around to see it's a child with curly hair. Wait a minute, is he actually a child? I mean he is short and all but his face looks like an adult and OH GOD WHAT ARE THOSE BIG AND HIDEOUS FEET WHY IS HE NOT WEARING SHOES OH MY GOD! He then says "Wait you are not Aradorn, who are you?" then runs away before you could answer. A weird and skinny ghoul hisses at you while running away with him."
  nf_eureka.18.a: "Hey kid, wait up, who is this Araborn?"
  nf_eureka.18.b: "What in the goddamn?"

  nf_eureka.19.t: "What's that on the ground?"
  nf_eureka.19.d: "You were walking on the same spot you saw that weird kid and ghoul yesterday and found a shiny ring on the ground. It has a small chain going through it too. Probably the dumb kid dropped it. You just sell it to a random merchant for some caps."
  nf_eureka.19.a: "Ka-ching"

  nf_eureka.20.t:0 "The Tales of Granite Company"
  nf_eureka.20.d:0 "'Kiss America Goodbye, Boys'.\n\nThese were Granite's last words as the Rig exploded, and his boys and girls fled Navarro. While hardliners fled East to Chicago and the Capital, Granite led those who either couldn't reach the evac zones or didn't want to. A group left behind, forgotten. Of course they turned to the Wasteland's most precious commodity - war. \n\nFor three decades the Granite Company fought and died, carefully maintaining failing power armour, as the radio carried words of a new president in the East. Some heroes, devoted to fighting the mutant threat, traveled on. Some of them stayed and died. After years of fighting, there was no one left devoted to the the Enclave's dreams.  \n\nThe Granite Company had many customers, but a few rules stood out."
  nf_eureka.20.a:0 "Granite would fight for anyone, no questions asked."

  nf_eureka.21.t:0 "Eureka!"
  nf_eureka.21.d:0 "Granite Company drifted through the Wastes for decades; but there was never a great place to find a home. Reno was too hot once the Salvatores fell from power. Vault City attracted some, but the NCR garrison made many veterans uncomfortable. Seattle? A nice place, before the Brotherhood showed up. MacArthur? Technically, Granite Company committed treason aiding the Chosen One in killing Frank Horrigan. What to do? \n\nBy this point, Eureka was home to several groups of mercenaries. What was one more? And so the last Enclave troops on the west coast set themselves up as mercenaries in the 'bum fuck of nowhere.'"

He piloted vertibirds to Koover, supped with Rio soldiers along the river, and learned much from the people. Much to his father's chagrin, he went, in a way, native. But he never placed roots, and never found a home. Granite Company just marched the Wastes, the only constant being caps for the soldiers, and taps for the fallen.  Until a chill day in November 2274, when the taps played for Granite.  \n\nAnd so passed the last American. For Granite Company, and the last of the Western Enclave, it was up to Granite to write the epilogue."

  nf_eureka.23.t:0 "In the Lair of the Bear"
  nf_eureka.23.d:0 "As the years went on, Eureka ran into a problem - the NCR was too damn successful. Who needed to hire mercenaries when California had a standing army of thousands of men with bloody mechanized units? Protecting brahmin caravans was well and good, but it couldn't pay the way raiding Vault City once did. The NCR increasingly viewed Eureka as an inconvenience and embarassment, a den of trouble on its borders.  Indeed, some felt it was only a matter of time before the NCR simply occupied Eureka to restore order. Some mercenaries moved east or north, while others cashed out. \n\nAnd a few wondered if Eureka would have to find some other way to support itself. But whatever Eureka did would attract the NCR's interest, and there was a chance the Republic would simply solve the problem once and for all."

Until now, Eureka was too remote and had little to offer the lands down south. There was ample farm land for staples, and no real market for luxury goods. But that has changed, and it opens an interesting opportunity.  \n\n Eureka could grow to rely upon resources and goods beyond manpower and mercenaries. The fish of the sea; the fruit of the land; and perhaps, with some hard work, the sweat of its people's brow. But to do that will require more settlers. Granite and [EUR.GetLeader], as the as the strongest forces in Eureka, are at an impasse.  [EUR.GetLeader] believes all are welcome, and would encourage everyone to immigrate. But Granite believes that Eureka should limit immigration to a respectable sort, hard working, industrious, relatively successful peoples. 'We  are not the Legion - we have no need of serfs.' Ultimately, who will prevail? \n\nAnd perhaps, just perhaps, Granite could send some feelers out to old friends."

Now Eureka hopes to attract investment and trade from the city, with several factions available. The Shi are always happy to trade for more produce and lumber, and offer their technological services. But they were never friends of Granite Company's predecessors, convinced that the Enclave almost nuked San Francisco. The Hubologists, for their part, know much about aviation. But not too much. And we must admit, their religious views are strange even for the Wasteland. Still, they would work with Granite Company.... Who does Eureka pick?"

While obviously ghouls and super mutants were potential threats, Granite could be perfectly civil and pleasant, setting an example for those who followed. Indeed, Granite and the Portmasters went on more than one successful venture together, especially a spectactular raid on the Great Eighties raid of 2268. \n\nBut this is not to deny that the two groups have tensions.  In particular, Granite Company is far less willing to work with the Republic, preferring a stand-off approach for their little town. But for now, this remains a theoretical disagreement. Both parties recognize that any conflict might ruin their little community, and neither group wants to invite the NCR north. And hey, some of the ghouls can make a pretty good rotgut."

  nf_eureka.38.d:0 "It seems like those eccentrics in Navarro have a deal for Redding's miners; they will offer some of their expertise. \n\nNeedless to say, we continue to be concerned about their obvious pro-Enclave ties. But with our ties in the Mojave, there is not much we can do against them. And our miners are willing to work with them. And to be fair, it's not like we haven't worked with raiders before.  Still, in a just society our capitalists would not do business with a potential enemy. Kind of outrageous, really."

  nf_eureka.40.d:0 "It appears that [NCR.GetLeader] is no fool, and prohibited Redding's merchants from working with us. Most unfortunate.

  nf_eureka.41.d:0 "With our victory in Navarro, we pulled off a miracle! We drove the NCR back and claimed Navarro as our buffer. Granite's men are setting up shop in Navarro, but now we're running into a bit of a mess. There are still thousands of people in the territory who hate each other, in a land with vast potential and promise. If we withdraw from the region the NCR or Shi will simply pour back in. And of course, if we manage it properly everyone in Eurkea will be set for life.  What do we do?"

  nf_eureka.42.d:0 "If Eureka is going to remain a force to be recokoned with as the Wasteland transitions to nations and empires, we're going to need guns. Heavy guns. Lots of heavy guns. But how? \n\nThere are a few ideas worth exploring, but they divided the cabal that runs Eureka.  Granite pushes for ties with Vault City, or perhaps with some friends out east. The Portmasters are willing to cut a deal with the NCR, offering assistance to the OSI in exchange for subsidies to Shady Sands.  And the Regulators? Well, they've got an idea. \n\nThe Shi were once masters of scientific innovation, with plans for space ships, new fuel sources, and more. But instead, their leadership fell under the sway of dueling dojos. While research continues, the bright promise of the Shi has dimmed.  Perhaps some of them would prefer a land where nobody is kung fu fighting?"

  nf_eureka.43.d:0 "San Francisco is dear to many of Eureka's contingent.  The Hubologists once stood on the Golden Gate to watch the stars collide. Granite Company shipped supplies to their outpost across the sea. And the Regulators passed through decades ago on their march north. A rich, prosperous city, before the Shi's gangs tore it apart.  But what shall we do with the Steel Palace? And the Emperor? \n\nGranite Company would use the Emperor to serve their interests, calculating the secrets of their old friends on the West Coast.  The Hubologists would use him to search for a better way to clenase humans of neurodynes. And the Regulators? They would simply sell him to the Brotherhood, and scrap him for parts. \n\nAnd sadly, of course, the NCR will be furious that we've sacked one of their major trading partners. Perhaps they are mobilizing for war even now!"

  nf_eureka.44.d:0 "The problem, you see, is that everyone else in Eureka was crazy. The Hubologists wanted purify neurodynes with MORE radiation. Granite chased the ghost of a dead world. And the Regulators thought they could become friends with the NCR, earning the trust of their ancient foes.  All were fools. San Francisco had much of value; tech that the Shi and Hubologists would have wasted. And the NCR meant the age of mercenaries in California drew to a close. But abroad? Well, there would always be need of a gun. Why not see who else needed a hand?"

No longer spurned by the NCR, no longer mercenaries. No, today - and tomorrow - we are the heroes of California. We tamed the North and did what they could not; and we'll keep on doing that, until the Republic gives us our due."

  nf_eureka.46.d:0 "The spirits of the dead are constantly trying to influence us. They reach into our brain and alter our chemistry to create neurodynes. Zeta radiation destroys some and drives the spirits away, but only for a short time. \n\n With our victory, the people are free of neurodynes once and for all, and we can pursue the Hub's grand plan. We will not just reach for Quetzal; we will build a Quetzal in the Wasteland, freeing our mind. They said the shuttle would never fly. They laughed at us. But now our brave astro-men set forth on a transcendant journey, and found the secrets of the star child. \n\nNow our sky wheel is in motion, and it will roll over all who oppose us. Quetzal, your time will come soon! "

They shall make a peace in this blasted desert. For how else can one save democracy?"
