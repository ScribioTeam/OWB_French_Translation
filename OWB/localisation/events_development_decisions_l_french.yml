  development_project_done_event.1.title:0 "Radioactive material leak confirmed!"
  development_project_done_event.1.desc_notech:0 "Our containment teams have attempted their best, but with only lead-lined steel suits they simply cannot approach the affected area without considerable risk. Photographic teams using badge dosimeters have been deployed with our NBC squads, as their film darkens in the presence of radiation, but such detection measures take hours if not days to inform us of dangerous pockets. We do not have the medicine required to treat radioation poisonning either, as such we can only hope to do whatever we can to reduce the scale of this catastrophe before it affects civilian zones."
  development_project_done_event.1.desc_lowtech:0 "NBC teams have been rapidly deployed throughout the facility, accompanied with containment and detection teams carrying backpack geiger counters for detections of radiation pockets. While most of the work must be done by hand, securing the site with decontamination teams and filtered water showers insures that most of the damage can be restricted to the immediate area surrounding the reactor. Rubber-coated suits and antimicrobial therapy should reduce the long-term effects on our soldiers, and widespread distribution of iodine pills to civilians will circumvent most damage."
  development_project_done_event.1.desc_adetech:0 "Our area detectors immediatly picked up the radiation, and our standby containment teams efficiently dealt with the leak with very minimal exposure thanks to their reinforced radiation suits. Construction crews are already on their way with lightweight equipment to plug any leak detected in the core, and medical camps have been setup around the perimeter. Overall, it was a very efficient operation, and thank God that we have the means to deal with this swiftly."
  development_project_done_event.1.desc_hightech:0 "Our intelligence crew deployed to the structure's control room thankfully managed to power on the old pre-war computers with the help of some portable fission devices, and have already engaged containment protocols. Power Armor teams fitted with the heaviest radioactive protection are on their way with transport bots carrying equipment to plug any leak detected by the system, and we expect minimal downtime in our operations."
  development_project_done_event.1.a:0 "Cut all information access, contain the spread of misinformation. The public will be told it was enemy sabotage."
  development_project_done_event.1.b:0 "Focus all available efforts toward protecting civilians, we cannot afford a nuclear incident."
  development_project_done_event.1.c:0 "Give my thanks to the containment team, now let's get this reactor back on."
  development_project_done_event.1.d:0 "Impressive indeed, the NBC officers will be pleased of the efficiency of their soldiers."

  development_project_done_event.2.title:0 "Power surge detected!"
  development_project_done_event.2.desc_notech:0 "With no knowledge of pre-war electronics, all we could do is issue an evacuation order and watch helplessly as multiple solar panels overloaded and shorted out, destroying a huge section of the plant. Thankfully at least the surge was contained by the drastic decrease in generated energy, but we have no chance of ever repairing such relics."
  development_project_done_event.2.desc_adetech:0 "As sapper teams had already been deployed throughout the facility to maintain and restore any available surge protector, we managed to contain it to a small sub-section of the plant. Our engineers predict minimal power loss, but it might take some time to replace every blown surge protector, and it gave quite a fright to our crew."
  development_project_done_event.2.desc_hightech:0 "Thankfully our engineering team had already found multiple overlapping surge protection system in an earlier inspection, and such measures managed to stop the surge with no damage to the sensitive electrical system. As we speak the surge protectors are already being replaced, and we expect a downtime in our operations of a few hours at most."
  development_project_done_event.2.a:0 "This operation has been a catastrophic failure, salvage what we can and redirect the little power we have."
  development_project_done_event.2.b:0 "Excellent job from our engineers, let us put this relic back online at last."
  development_project_done_event.2.c:0 "Get this junk back online, it's time to finally bring back electricity to the wasteland."

  development_project_done_event.3.title:0 "The defences are online!"
  development_project_done_event.3.desc_notech:0 "Our advanced elements sadly triggered the base's automated turrets, and did not have sufficient anti-armor weaponry on hand to deal with them. Reinforcement had to be bought up and rush the turrets with handheld explosives under covering fire. As expected, they received major casualties, and have lost more than 70% of their operational strength. We do not expect them to recover anytime soon."
  development_project_done_event.3.desc_lowtech:0 "Our recon team triggered the base's automated defense system during their sweep, but were thankfully able to deal with them with minimal damage thanks to multiple anti-tank rifle squads deployed alongside them. They are still reporting in but it seems they took minimal casualties, mostly from the element of surprise."
  development_project_done_event.3.desc_adetech:0 "Our first sweep activated the base's defenses, but thanks to knowledge of pre-war military installations and a very distrustful officer having already ordered anti-tank squads to be put on high alert we took no casualties, with only a few wounded. Rocket launchers made short work of those relics, and we are continuing our operation as planned with minimal downtime."
  development_project_done_event.3.desc_hightech:0 "With our jammer fields deployed around the base, defenses barely had time to come online before their targeting softwares were scrambled to hell and back. Our soldiers had all the time they needed to set explosives and destroy the now useless turrets. Our scanners have also revelealed additional sub-sections of the base not accessible by personel, we theorize they hold top-secret equipment."
  development_project_done_event.3.a:0 "Evacuate the wounded, and pray for the casualties. This better be worth it."
  development_project_done_event.3.b:0 "Give my congratulations to the AT teams, and continue operation."
  development_project_done_event.3.c:0 "That officer deserves a raise, bring up more supplies and keep up the sweep."
  development_project_done_event.3.d:0 "Extremely good work, give a free round at the bar to the team once they're back."
