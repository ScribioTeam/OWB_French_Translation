He was provided with sufficient means to fulfil his programming and he was content to do so.\n\nNot long after vault 29 went online, ZAX received a broadcast request for open access to his programming. He immediately asked for proper security clearance and awaited a reply. Within moments the proper security codes were received and a download channel opened. Over the next several days a new primary program was entered into his main databanks. Finding the new program to be counter to his original goals, ZAX asked for further security clearance. He sent a request for a private accesses code that only one person would know, that of his creator. Days later he received the code and initiated the new program, thereby deleting the old.\n\nZAX now works for the central computer intelligence of the Nursery known as Diana. Like most computers of his genre, he is content to serve and perform his duties to the best of his capabilities."
