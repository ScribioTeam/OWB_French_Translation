attis_1: "Remnants of the Attis Army"
attis_1_desc: "Attis, more then any other mutant, was ambitious."
attis_2: "Our Assignment"
attis_2_desc: "The mission he assigned us, to him, was the most important."
attis_3: "Our Legacy"
attis_3_desc: "We have accomplished much since his end."

mutant_industry: "Mutant Industry"
mutant_industry_desc: "One of the first and most important aspects of a modern state —especially in the wasteland— is the ability to organize a cohesive and directed industrial effort. Being a nation of giant green people does nothing to change this fact."

mutant_fortifications_teams: "Fortification Battalions" 
mutant_fortifications_teams_desc: "Organizing groups of able bodied mutants into fortification battalions will allow us to fasttrack the construction of outposts along our more troublesome borders, with the added bonus being that these souls can be conscripted into general service."

mutant_not_a_drop_to_drink: "Not a Drop to Drink"
mutant_not_a_drop_to_drink_desc: "Though access to the coast brings us ample access to water, almost none of it is fit for drinking. However, with the construction of naval dockyards and ports we can maintain a standing fleet."

mutant_red_ones_go_faster: "The Red Ones Go Faster"
mutant_red_ones_go_faster_desc: "It would be negligent to not consider out capability for assembling and housing aircraft of all kinds, the paving of airfield and construction of hangers coupled with the christening of new military factories will help us cover our aerial bases."

mutant_workshops: "Mutant Workshops"
mutant_workshops_desc: "Super Mutant factory workers have a unique set of needs and strengths, the construction of civilian industries in which these people can produce both new buildings and consumer goods will create a solid steel backbone for which our industry can rest upon."

mutant_sized_tools: "Mutant Sized Tools"
mutant_sized_tools_desc: "Tools built for regular people have a tendency to break and become unwieldy in mutant hands; with a bit of design work and standardization across our factories will equip workers with tools they can depend on, and use to build a better future."

mutant_arms_factories: "Mutant Arms Factories"
mutant_arms_factories_desc: "Old World assembly lines aren't really fit to construct weapons of the proper size and scope for a super mutant. This shortcoming means that we should shore up our own military industry with new arms factories that can keep pace with the needs of an FEV improved army."

mutant_air_defense: "Clear Sky Construction"
mutant_air_defense_desc: "We can build all the factories, roads, and docks we want; but even just a single bomb can knock out a workshop for days if not weeks. A blanket of anti-air guns will ensure that enemy pilots have a hard time damaging industrial targets even if they maintain air superiority."

mutant_mining_operations: "Mutant Mining Operations"
mutant_mining_operations_desc: "Mutants have an excellent physique for mining. Strong back, tall, can carry a ton of weight without even breaking a sweat. With even minimal effort we could crack the Texas soil open and begin to plunder it's mineral riches for ourselves."

mutant_power: "Green Energy" 
mutant_power_desc: "Electricity is an important resource. To ensure more people can have their homes and workplaces powered, we should commission the construction of wind farms and refurbish old fusion generators. It's no Hoover Dam, but it'll keep the lights on and the toaster working."

mutant_wells: "All's Well That Wells Well"
mutant_wells_desc: "Irradiated water from either the gulf or it's tributaries generally isn't safe to drink. But water dug out from hundred year old aquifers is almost entirely cured of it's radioactive kiss. Though normal mutants generally don't mind a bit of spicy water, for the purposes of managing humies and trading it's better to start digging out the clean stuff."

mutant_manufacturing: "Electronics Manufacturing" 
mutant_manufacturing_desc: "Unlike electricity, water, and metal, electronics are not the kind of resource that can be drawn from the land itself; producing even simple electronic circuits and components requires specialized factories that are suited to small scale manufacturing, recent plans draw up just such a set of facilities"

mutant_behemoths_of_industry: "Behemoths of Industry"
mutant_behemoths_of_industry_desc: "We've finally achieved a modern and varied economy, between extraction and the production of both civilian and war materials; any rival wasteland stand should find themselves both green with envy (Not as green as us) and afraid of our capability."

mutant_scavenging: "Mutant Scavenging"
mutant_scavenging_desc: "There's a lot to be found in the remnants of the Old World, things far more advanced than we can produce; even just a little bit of study can yield insight in how to recreate these relics"

mutant_scavconstructionvehicles: "Study Construction Vehicles"
mutant_scavconstructionvehicles_desc: "One of the things that made construction and manufacturing so advanced in the past was the advent of specialized industrial vehicles, by trying to reverse engineer them we can come closer to assembling our own metallic beasts of burden."

mutant_scavtanks: "Improvise Improved Armored Vehicles"
mutant_scavtanks: "Just about anything can be made into an armored vehicle if you're willing to weld enough metal plates to it. Using a little bit of our own knowhow, and studying the designs of our neighbors and predecessors, we can fashion bigger and badder tanks."

mutant_scavenging_2: "Expand the Scavenging Program"
mutant_scavenging_2_desc: "So far our initiative towards scavenging the wastes has born fruit! We now have greater access to vehicles, both for the purpose of warmaking and industry; and with the promise of dangerous weapons to be found lost amongst the rubble, more mutants are drawn away from the front and into the ruins."

mutant_scavenging_support: "Study Specialized Equipment"
mutant_scavenging_support_desc: "The Wasteland is filled with hundreds specialized pieces of equipment that hint at the intricacies of warfare before the bombs, while there isn't enough of any one type to supply an army's worth of specialists, there is enough to study, and refurbish into general support equipment"

mutant_scavenging_weapons: "Reclaim Disused Dakka"
mutant_scavenging_weapons_desc: "One thing the Wasteland is full of, and we like more than anything else, is Dakka. Big ones, little ones, automatic ones, explosive ones, we can't get enough of them! While being both the backbone of our army and the main incentive for muties to pick through the rubble, shiny new shooters are truly a prize to behold."

mutant_scavenging_3: "Formalize the Scavenging Program"
mutant_scavenging_3_desc: "While highly beneficial to us, our efforts in the wasteland have been mostly ad hoc, and without any set standard or procedure. As we continue to draw prospectors and pull technological marvels out of the rubble, we should make at least some effort to organizing the riley bands of scavengers in a meaningful way."

mutant_scavenging_navy: "Pull Wrecks Ashore"
mutant_scavenging_navy_desc: "While Attis wasn't known for making mutants a very navally inclined people, by resurfacing old wrecks and trying to put together what we can from their water-ravaged hulks we can design bigger, badder boats that'll surely rule the waves."

mutant_scavenging_air: "Scour Airfields"
mutant_scavenging_air_desc: "Airplane engineering is complicated for normal humans, but without any specialists, and pilots that are about twice as big in every aspect it really starts to become a Sisyphean science; though a nation with active and effective airpower is one that can win wars with far greater is than one without, so we should endeavor to use what we can from older designs to build our own planes."

mutant_scavenging_4: "Finalize the Mutant Scavenging Program"
mutant_scavenging_4_desc: "Our efforts to find knowledge and resources in the wastes has given us insight into just about all of the scientific fields. It's taken us to new heights, farther coastlines, and deeper depths than anything before ever before. The Scavenger is a new and proud caste of mutant society, and it makes excellent time in bringing us fabled treasures of the Old World."

mutant_scavenging_6_civ: "Civilian Specialization"
mutant_scavenging_6_civ_desc: "Now that we've fostered an effective and eager force for scouring the wastes, the question remains if it's primary focus should be technologies for rebuilding the world, or conquering it; the answer is simple, we should focus our efforts on rebuilding the world as we see fit."

mutant_scavenging_5_war: "Hawkish Specialization" 
mutant_scavenging_5_war_desc: "Now that we've fostered an effective and eager force for scouring the wastes, the question remains if it's primary focus should be technologies for rebuilding the world, or subjugating it; the answer is simple, we should focus our efforts on conquering the world as we see fit!"

shale_follow_in_attis_footsteps: "Follow in Attis's Footsteps"
shale_follow_in_attis_footsteps_desc: "Attis was a legend among mutants. One of the great generals who served under the Master himself - a titan of a figure who led his army east in hopes of finding a future for human kind. Ultimately, he met his end somewhere within the secret vault - but that just means he ended his campaign in honor.\nShale wants nothing more in life then to emulate his predecessor and become just as great of a hero as he was."

shale_garb_fit_for_a_general: "Garb Fit for a General"
shale_garb_fit_for_a_general_desc: "We have some caps laying around, lets spend them on getting our armor refit.\nOne should always dress for the job they want, not the job they have."

shale_attis_era_training: "Attis Era Training"
shale_attis_era_training_desc: "By serving under Attis we have learned of some of the unique training regimens he would hold. With his soldiers Attis would often hold month long "Boot Camps" deep in isolation in the darkest of caves. There, Mutants would be forced to eat whatever they could find. Those that went against the group were weeded out and when the training was done what was left would be more the loyal army for it."

shale_the_attis_born: "The "Attis Born""
shale_the_attis_born_desc: "Attis brought with him from the west a small amount of Mariposa FEV. With this, he was able to create "Behemoths", titans of flesh and strength to conquer his enemies. We don't have much of this FEV left - but we should put it to use!"

shale_a_curious_purchase: "A Curious Purchase"
shale_a_curious_purchase_desc: "We have some caps laying around, lets spend them on.. a curiosity. A merchant from Los is willing to sell us a rather peculier "Shop-Tec" vending terminal - of which he claims is from the Secret Vault itself! -... Curious."

shale_purchase_weapon_schematics: "Purchase Weapon Schematics"
shale_purchase_weapon_schematics_desc: "Within this Shop-Tec terminal are some old weapon schematics we can purchase to put to use in our army!"

shale_purchase_fev: "Purchase FEV"
shale_purchase_fev_desc: "Not only can we purchase information stored within the terminal - but also purchase "services" from it. It is willing to extrapolate the location of more FEV for us if we were to purchase such a task from it."

shale_the_path_of_glory: "The Path of Glory"
shale_the_path_of_glory_desc: "The Path of Glory was what Attis called the fate of the Super Mutants - a one way road of conquest, death and victory. Many mutants accept this fate - that their kind is numbered and ultimately doomed to extinction.. Yet Attis always seemed to be contemplative of this fate - as if somewhere near the end of this road would be the true fate of mutant-kind - one not of oblivion, but of evolution..."

sha_taking_a_piece_of_the_pie: "A Lucrative Oppurtunity"
sha_taking_a_piece_of_the_pie_desc: "The TAA has found themselves in a vulnerable position. Perhaps we can take a bite out of them while they are busy?"

shale_put_the_kibosh_on_los: "Put the Kibosh on Los"
shale_put_the_kibosh_on_los_desc: "Los is where Attis met his end, ultimately. A dark city of deranged, crazy ghouls who preach a faith of insanity and oblivion. If Attis was alive they would never have been around to today - lets fix that."

shale_conquering_carbon: "Conquering Carbon"
shale_conquering_carbon_desc: "Carbon was always a modest little town - a sinful place where humans linger about at the end of the world. This place has been destroyed once before - lets do it again."

shale_revive_the_raider_matrons: "Revive the "Matrons""
shale_revive_the_raider_matrons_desc: "In the past, there was a group of raiders who were more willing to work with Attis in his plans then most - a cutthroat group known as the "Matrons". We can revive this group if we wish - perhaps they will be easier to work with then Carbon was."

shale_sell_off_the_spoils_of_war: "Sell Off the Spoils of War"
shale_sell_off_the_spoils_of_war_desc: "The mistake Attis made when he destroyed this place was that he underestimated the tenacity of these people to reinhabit here. We need to get the people out of here if we are to ensure this town cant come back again - lets sell off the population into slavery - destroy their culture from the bottom up."

shale_sanctify_the_city: "Sanctify the City"
shale_sanctify_the_city_desc: "The people of Los have absolutely no buisness working with us - they are lunatics, after all. Lets do what we can to make this place -OURS-."

shale_puppet_the_church_of_the_lost: "Puppet the Church of the Lost"
shale_puppet_the_church_of_the_lost_desc: "Of course, there was a time that this city was more.. negotiable to our cause. Blake was his name, the leader of their ranks before now - they were willing to work 'with' us mutants, submit to us. Lets ensure that this new leadership is just as willing to agree to our demands."

shale_the_secret_vault_ruins: "The Secret Vault Ruins"
shale_the_secret_vault_ruins_desc: "We are finally here, Attis's final resting place. It is -...\nIt is a complete mess, nearly the entire facility is in ruins! Still, there is some wreckage here that might prove useful to us.."

shale_encrypted_information: "Encrypted Information"
shale_encrypted_information_desc: "Sadly, not all of the stuff we found here is really usable - a lot of it is heavily encrypted pre-war buisness information that has feasibly no use to us in our current age. However, trying to hack into that information is actually pretty good practice for our encryption skills - even if we don't need the information itself."

shale_automated_training_holograms: "Automated Training Holograms"
shale_automated_training_holograms_desc: "What luck! We found a hologram emitter used for training the vault security personnel! We can train our troops with this."

shale_partial_supply_recovery: "Weapons from the Last Operation"
shale_partial_supply_recovery_desc: "We have found a small number of weapons clearly of super mutant design - weapons from the last contingent Attis brought with him before he met his end."

shale_bobbleheads_galore: "Bobbleheads Galore!"
shale_bobbleheads_galore_desc: "It feels like for every piece of rubble we pull out there are at least twenty shiny, squeaky bobbleheads in its place. Some people say these can be a "Good Luck" charm - whatever that means."

shale_an_unfortunate_reunion: "An Unfortunate Reunion"
shale_an_unfortunate_reunion_desc: "It turns out that this top level facility isn't all there is to the vault - looking deeper, we can see there is clearly some sort of deeper bottom facility! Maybe there we can find what really happened to Attis - perhaps even his remains?"

shale_defending_against_the_monster: "Defending Against the Monster"
shale_defending_against_the_monster_desc: "We have heard word that a monster is heading this way - we can't let him interfer in our glorious conquests! Lets hire someone so we can get some help dealing with him."

shale_planning_against_the_paladins: "Planning Against the Paladins" 
shale_planning_against_the_paladins_desc: "Ultimately, our conquests will need to include the lands of the east - the lands of the "Paladins". Lets investigate ways that we can sucesfully win this future war."

shale_striking_eden: "Eradicating Eden"
shale_striking_eden_desc: "With the matter of Attis's remains.. dealt with we can focus on continuing our conquests. Scarlet has been a pain in our side for far too long - keeping us from sucesfully reintegrating our wayward mutant brothers by standing stalwart in her mutated forest. Lets show her what it means to stand up to a titan."

shale_fruits_of_our_labour: "Fruits of our Labour"
shale_fruits_of_our_labour_desc: "They say this forest was grown by a man known as "Reese", a strange Cypher who hoped to bring the earth to paradise. Admittedly, a goal Attis shared. Let us partake in his fruit!"

shale_tame_the_beasts: "Tame the Beasts"
shale_tame_the_beasts_desc: "Not all within this forest is so kind - Scarlet was protecting it for a reason. There are great beasts, monsters and devils within this land - let us show them the true kings of the jungle - add their strength to our own."

shale_unite_the_army: "The Three Way War for Unity"
shale_unite_the_army_desc: "Its time we brought together this shattered army, showed our brothers who is on top."

shale_ethos_of_the_army: "Ethos of the Army"
shale_ethos_of_the_army_desc: "Now that we have unified our army we can look towards improving it - let us take the best ideas of our conquered subjects and make ourselves better for it!"

shale_ancient_techniques_of_the_ironmongers: "Ancient Techniques of the Ironmongers"
shale_ancient_techniques_of_the_ironmongers_desc: "The Ironmongers have become true masters of the forge - taking Attis's order to them to secure the factories to the south far too literally. The strength they have learned in their forges will be used to push our tanks forward!"

shale_mysteries_of_the_spores: "Mysteries of the Spores"
shale_mysteries_of_the_spores_desc: "Sometimes, I can hear Reese whispering to me in the forest of Eden. I try not to think about it - but it can be hard to get out of your head. Those mysteries, the riddles he tells you will be something we will carry with us."

shale_the_dreams_of_unity: "The Dreams of Unity"
shale_the_dreams_of_unity_desc: "Keats was a decent man - wishing to uphold the true belief of the Children of the Cathedral. There is some truth to what the Master said - let us ensure that his words are not forgotten."

shale_faith_of_the_army: "Faith of the Army"
shale_faith_of_the_army_desc: "We need to ensure that our army has one faith, one -belief- that carries them forward. Attis taught in the Path of Glory - what will we teach our men?"

shale_strength_in_supremacy: "Strength in Supremacy"
shale_strength_in_supremacy_desc: "Super Mutants are meant to inherit the world. Humans wasted their chance to this place - it is ours now. We will find the secret to reproduction - we will find the secret to immortality, we will find the secret to strength and power and true rulership!"

shale_strength_in_unity: "Strength in Unity"
shale_strength_in_unity_desc: "The Master's teachings will carry us forward. We should not forget what He taught us - the one that brought us into this world in the first place. This is our gift from him - let us cherish it."

shale_strength_in_insanity: "Strength in Insanity"
shale_strength_in_insanity_desc: "Rationality, order, reason - none of it makes sense in the wasteland. Blake was right - the only truth to the world is conquest, destruction and unbriddled chaos. The world has already been destroyed - lets bring it down once again!"

shale_the_road_of_conquest: "The Road of Conquest"
shale_the_road_of_conquest_desc: "It is time to test ourselves against the best Texas has to offer. This is where we show ourselves to be the true heirs to Attis's legacy - or die trying."

imo_the_steelworks: "The Steelworks"
imo_the_steelworks_desc: "When Juggernaught's warband was given the order from Attis to seize the southern industrial heartbed of Texas he took that order diligently. It was a simple matter of fighting off those who used to live there - simple raiders and small creatures alike... What those Super Mutants wouldn't have prediced was just how much they "loved" the place they took. So much metal, so many tools and so much FUN! The Ironmongers made the Steelworks their home, their identity."

imo_iron_flyers: "Iron Flyers"
imo_iron_flyers_desc: "Being a creature as heavy as a mutant comes with a certain -.. fear of falling. After all - when you weigh so much you typically do more damage when you fall over. This fear goes doubly when deep in the skies! Still, some of the metal workers of the Ironmongers have made some progress in "Flyer" development - wowing their contempories!"

imo_trained_mantis_gearjocks: "Trained Mantis Gearjocks"
imo_trained_mantis_gearjocks_desc: "Within the deep halls of the Ironmongers factories it is difficult for large super mutants to find the tools that they need at a quick notice. This is why they use what they call "Gearjocks" - trained mantises to work as their assistants in place of slaves or indentured servants. These small, trained and loyal creatures are able to quickly navigate the desolate forges and find whatever tool their masters need - the perfect companion to the master smith."

imo_building_the_perfect_war_machine: "Building the Perfect War Machine"
imo_building_the_perfect_war_machine_desc: "The Ironmongers do not tend prefer fighting on land with a dakka and choppa - no, instead they prefer their war machines - the Battlewagons! Great treaded vehicles meant to run over their foes with turrets atop their frame for additional fire support. Few can stand up to a threat so dangerous!"

imo_loud_engines: "Loud Engines"
imo_loud_engines_desc: "By purposefully making our engines as loud as possible we can increase the intimidation factor of our army. Who needs stealth when you are working from within a metal frame three feet thick?"

imo_right_tool_for_da_job: "Right Tool for 'Da Job"
imo_right_tool_for_da_job_desc: "Its always important to find the right tool for work. Sometimes you need a wrench, sometimes you need a drill - sometimes you need bits of flesh to lubricate the gears..."

imo_the_battlewagon: "The Battlewagon"
imo_the_battlewagon_desc: "A new stockpile of Battlewagons has been made! Our enemies will fear us when they see these rolling across the battlefield!"

imo_chase_them_down: "Chase Them Down!"
imo_chase_them_down_desc: "Puny little Racree are good at hiding from our Battlewagons - but their stubby legs make it hard for them to run in a open field!"

imo_blow_em_out_of_their_burrows: "Blow Em' Out of Their Burrows!"
imo_blow_em_out_of_their_burrows_desc: "Racree, unlike other smallies do not live on the ground! Instead they dig holes and live inside of the dirt itself.\nOne of our work-smiths came up with a good idea... why dont we just toss boom-sticks into their holes to blow em out?"

imo_raccoon_killin_guns: "Raccoon Killin' Guns"
imo_raccoon_killin_guns_desc: "Soft Racree hides are easy to pierce with the right bullet. We can shoot em from a fair distance away before they even see us!"

imo_target_practice_against_the_taa: "Target Practice Against the TAA"
imo_target_practice_against_the_taa_desc: "Normally its always been so difficult to get together a war party to invade into the western human lands... Recently however there has been some sort of change in power - perhaps this is a good time to launch a raid?"

imo_crystal_city_ammo_factory: "Crystal City Ammo Factory"
imo_crystal_city_ammo_factory_desc: "We found a ammo factory! Sadly the bullets here are a bit too small mostly to use with our dakka's - but there are some that fit the chamber fine!"

imo_huajillo_honey: "Huajillo Honey"
imo_huajillo_honey_desc: "We found some strange, preserved sap inside of some jars. Our Gearjocks absolutely "love" the taste - it seems to encourage them to work faster if we feed them it!"

imo_flames_of_the_forge: "Flames of the Forge"
imo_flames_of_the_forge_desc: "The heat of the forge is a tough thing for any mutant to stand, yet when one stands strong and withstands it they become all the stronger for it."

imo_flesh_shredding_bullets: "Flesh Shredding Bullets"
imo_flesh_shredding_bullets_desc: "By lining our bullets with a rusty, acidic compound we can improve their effectiveness in hitting soft targets!"

imo_unification_wars: "Unification Wars"
imo_unification_wars_desc: "To the north the other remnants of the Attis Army have mostly left us alone.. yet that wont always be the case. Eventually they will try to call us back - take away this identity we have made for ourselves. We will never surrender the forge - even if it means having to unify the army ourselves to do so!"

imo_fort_stockton: "Fort Stockton"

imo_attack_arm: "Destroy the Droidy Boys"
imo_attack_arm_desc: "The Army of Mexico always did confuse the Ironmongers. Their War Machines were so tiny - who could ever sit inside of one of those "Robots" to pilot it? It was insane!"

uoa_fulfilling_campaign_promises: "Fulfilling Our Campaign Promises"
uoa_fulfilling_campaign_promises_desc: "The Unity of Austin is hardly a dictatorship. We value principles of democracy! That is why Keats', every few years has to remind people why he is the best pick for the leader of the city through running a election!

uoa_invest_into_sterility_research: "Invest Into Sterility Research"
uoa_invest_into_sterility_research_desc: "For Super Mutants, the idea that their race is on a biological clock is something that haunts those with greater minds - finding the answer to mutant sterility was the original reason Attis came to Texas in the first place, after all. We made some promises to see if we could fund some research into this direction - lets follow up on those promises!"

uoa_experimental_hormones: "Experimental Hormone Research"
uoa_experimental_hormones_desc: "Mutant bodies do not produce the necessary hormones needed for child rearing - nearly all such bodily functions are rendered innert through the inherent process of mutation.

uoa_form_the_committee_for_super_mutant_survival: "Form the Committee of Super Mutant Survival"
uoa_form_the_committee_for_super_mutant_survival_desc: "Keats' shouldn't be expected to helm this project forever - it would take decades to potentially crack the code on the matter of mutant sterility.

uoa_human_mutant_integration_seminars: "Human-Mutant Integration Seminars"
uoa_human_mutant_integration_seminars: "It can be tough for Muties and Humies to get along - especially in a political climate like that in Dallas and Austin. We need to make efforts to mend the divide between the races!"

uoa_putting_plants_to_use_desc: "Scarlet has been watching the mutant plants near Reese's old G.E.C.K. for quite some time - still, we have the occasional bugger and snapper here in Austin that tends to bother the kids. Lets tame these beasts so they wont be so much of a problem!"
