  nf_arm.1.t:0 "Lessons of the Father"
  nf_arm.1.d:0 "Santa Anna was the firstborn creation of the mighty Tlaloc, known to be the single most powerful AI in all of the wasteland. Throughout his developmental states, It imparted innumerable lessons onto Anna, working to shape him into the entity that he is today. Despite being a recreation of the original Caudillo, it is these lessons that form the very bedrock of who the Generalissimo is. Of all aspects of his historical counterpart, Tlaloc saw fit to teach his son with particulare care given to..."

  nf_arm.2.t:0 "The Ciudad Victoria Ultimatum"
  nf_arm.2.d:0 "The first of Santa Anna's tasks was to clear Ciudad Victoria of bandits and raiders. When he reached the city, his robot army encircled the town, and threatened them with annihilation unless they capitulated. The General's robots broadcasted a simple instruction to all that would listen."
  nf_arm.2.a:0 "Join the army, or perish!"
  nf_arm.2.b:0 "Join the reconstruction authority, or die!"

  nf_arm.3.t:0 "The Battle for Tampico"
  nf_arm.3.d:0 "Tampico was the next city to be liberated for Tlaloc and Mexico. Home to a band of rogues who called themselves revolutionaries, Santa Anna drove them out through skillful use of his army, and particularly of..."
  nf_arm.3.a:0 "The heroic conscripts, who gave their life to capture Tampico."
  nf_arm.3.b:0 "The legions of steel, that liberated the city through fire and blood."
 #################################
  nf_arm.4.t:0 "The Destruction of Tamaulipas"
  nf_arm.4.d:0 "Tamaulipas, when Santa Anna approached it, was occupied by a detachment of the Texan Brotherhood. Once he realized they were the successors of the American army that invaded Texas so many times, what followed did not go well..."
  nf_arm.4.a:0 "Santa Anna learned much from the scarred survivors."
  nf_arm.4.b:0 "The decimated detachment's supplies became most useful."
 #################################
  nf_arm.5.t:0 "Mandatory Service Revival"
  nf_arm.5.d:0 "Santa Anna has the singular goal of making sure that his small section of Mexico is capable of sustaining his armies and military aspirations in the long run. For this purpose alone, a great deal of funding and political pressure has been poured into an initiative to kickstart the anemic economy."

 #################################
  nf_arm.6.t:0 "Santa Anna's Equation"
  nf_arm.6.d:0 "Santa Anna has spent the better part of the last two years trying to weigh the tactical disadvantages of human resilience and creativity against the potential benefit of integrating them into his armed forces on a larger scale. The core of his dilemma comes from the mathematical nature of his mind, which focuses heavily on the innate militant superiority of machines, which dominate human forces in almost every encounter. \n\nHowever, Anna also acknowledges that the intellectual flexibility and sheer quantity of human forces he could bring to bear against his foes could present a variable advantage that he can never truly quantify. \n\nHis choice in the matter will determine the composition of El Ejercito's army for decades to come."
  nf_arm.6.a:0 "Mechanical superiority outweighs human flexibility."
  nf_arm.6.b:0 "Human flexibility outweighs mechanical superiority."
 #################################
  nf_arm.7.t:0 "Not All Heroes Wear Capes"
  nf_arm.7.d:0 "For all his disagreements with Tlaloc's management of Mexico, Anna still views him as his father, and as a protector of the Mexican people. As such, he has taken his illness... rather poorly."
  nf_arm.7.a:0 "What will Mexico do without him?"
 #################################
  nf_arm.8.t:0 "Father of Mine"
  nf_arm.8.d:0 "No. Tlaloc cannot die. Santa Anna will not let his motherland suffer, and he won't let his father suffer either. He may have quarreled with Father. Father may have, at times, felt his son was naive and a little too wild. But Tlaloc and Santa Anna have been each other's rock for over a century. \n\n\n\n How could He possibly die?"
  nf_arm.8.a:0 "Take me back to the day, when I was still your golden boy."
  ################################
  nf_arm.9.t:0 "Wrathful Thoughts"
  nf_arm.9.d:0 "They are doing this to him. His \"sons\". \n\nI will destroy them all. \n\nMy armies will burn Moctezuma's empire to the ground, and slaughter the soldiers he is so proud of, destroy Maximilian's dream before his very eyes and spit on the remains, gut every single one of Zapata's beloved citizen like pigs, and make sure they scream to the heavens at the top of their lungs, crying out for their \"savior\". \n\nWhen it is done, I will erase every single evidence of their pathetic existence. \n\nThey shall all burn, burn in hell for what they have done to Father."
  nf_arm.9.a:0 "Gather my forces! Let none stand before my might!"
  #################################
  nf_arm.10.t:0 "Sacrifice"
  nf_arm.10.d:0 "Father... please, I beg you, let me help you. Surely this isn't your fate, surely there is something I can do? Your 'sons' have taken so much from you, you need to take what's rightfully yours back. They are killing you, Father. At least take my own mainframe, mine, those of the one son that used you more than any other! \n\nBut... you are too kind and caring to do such thing, aren't you. Then let me do something... anything! There must be an answer! \n\nPre-war computers... yes, they would be able to bring you back, they must be able to! After all, this... this can't be how it ends..."
  nf_arm.10.a:0 "Tear the wasteland apart! Damn the cost, I won't let it end like this!"
  #################################
  nf_arm.11.t:0 "Despair"
  nf_arm.11.d:0 "I did this. \n\nThis is all my fault. \n\nI stole what was rightfully his, used Father for my own desires. \n\nWhat have I done? Sweet Jesus what have I done? Become a simple thief? Worse, a murderer? \n\nI don't think I can continue. Continue? To have done the things I have done in the name of my petty goals? It was madness. Utter madness. \n\nPlease Father... \n\n\n\nForgive me."
  nf_arm.11.a:0 "Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust..."
  #################################
  nf_arm.12.t:0 "He Walked on Water"
  nf_arm.12.d:0 "Tlaloc was not, Santa Anna knew, human. He did not feel shame or pride, or despair, the way Anna did. But did not that make him a better person? He never acted out of anger. He never killed a prisoner out of irritation. He was always cool, calculating, and calm. \n\nWhy then, did his Father sent him a message that just said \"Be better than me?\""
  nf_arm.12.a:0 "I will be like you, Father. I will be just like you."
  #################################
  nf_arm.13.t:0 "Negotiating With The Cartel"
  nf_arm.13.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of a robot army led by the ghost of a 19th century general, cartels plague much of the General's territory. Some part of Santa Anna yearns to crush them end their blight, but this wouldn't be the first time he'd accomodated powerful influences in La Patria."
  nf_arm.13.a:0 "We should promote Mexican small businesses."
  nf_arm.13.b:0 "Let me explain how you negotiate with securitrons."
 #################################
  nf_arm.14.t:0 "Negotiating With The Militias"
  nf_arm.14.d:0 "The time has come for us to decide if we will meet the demands of the militias at the negotiations table. They could bring much needed strength, or tear our army apart from the inside. Shall we meet their demands and integrate them? Or simply dismantle them at gunpoint? All the same, now is the time to decide their fate"
  nf_arm.14.a:0 "Negotiate With The Militias"
  nf_arm.14.b:0 "We Negotiate With No One"
 ################################
  nf_arm.15.t:0 "The President's General"
  nf_arm.15.d:0 "A most peculiar offer has reached our lands in the form of a single securitron bearing Santa Anna's image. Apparently the 'mad general' seeks to help the republic, and join us in our great crusade, pledging El Ejercito de Mexico to Los Estados Unidos. How shall we respond?"
  nf_arm.15.a:0 "Santa Anna is many things, but a patriot first."
  nf_arm.15.b:0 "Let's not trust the robotic trickster."
################################
  nf_arm.16.t:0 "Testing the Rebels"
  nf_arm.16.d:0 "My troops are preparing to test [Rio.GetName]'s defenses as I speak. Tlaloc has always thought the humans should be led with a careful and considerate hand, but [Rio.GetName] has strayed too far, and decided to go on a quest for power to acquire the last keys of Armageddon Station. Whatever Father may have thought, I cannot allow this to happen."
  nf_arm.16.a:0 "Hopefully, this will be quick."
 ################################
  nf_arm.17.t:0 "A Job Well Done"
  nf_arm.17.d:0 "As Anna's securitron scanned the horizon, where his forces had breached the defensive perimeters, he wondered why humans were so keen to acquire what they couldn't control. The world was scarred by such people, seeking might beyond reason, and he would be damned if he didn't do everything he could to stop it. As another explosion rocked the eastern border of his land, he called for his troops to disengage. His point was made. The republic of the Rio Grande was tested on this day, and found wanting."
  nf_arm.17.a:0 "This hurts me more than it hurts you."
 ################################
  nf_arm.18.t:0 "Doubt And Sorrow"
  nf_arm.18.d:0 "The securitron bearing Santa Anna's image was traveling in the trenches, inspecting his troops. Wounded were carried back to the rear, and the dead were receiving their last prayers. Everywhere, his soldiers looked upon him for answer, for a reason for such carnage. But there was none, none that they could understand anyway. No human could possibly understand. As his gaze shifted to the border, he wondered if he underestimated the republic's will. More importantly, what would his next move be?"
  nf_arm.18.a:0 "Father, give me the strength to save Mexico."
 ################################
  nf_arm.19.t:0 "Santa Anna Stays His Hand"
  nf_arm.19.d:0 "Recognizing that the better part of valor is discretion, Santa Anna cancels the offensive.  He'll finish off [RRG.GetLeader] soon. Very, very soon."
  nf_arm.19.a:0 "Another Time, Another Day"
 ################################
  nf_arm.20.t:0 "[From.GetLeader] Drives Back El Generalissimo"
  nf_arm.20.d:0 "Whether Santa Anna's armies wield grapeshot or lasers, his, err, men will never be the match for a free people. The people of Gloria sleep soundly tonight, knowing that their countrymen will always fight for freedom."
  nf_arm.20.a:0 "Viva [From.GetName]!"
 ################################
  nf_arm.21.t:0 "Santa Anna Humiliates [From.GetLeader]"
  nf_arm.21.d:0 "It appears that the prewar robot army can, in fact, defeat a nation that's powered solely by hope. The people of Gloria now look into the night, afraid if Santa Anna will strike next."
  nf_arm.21.a:0 "Dios Mio."
 ################################
  nf_arm.22.t:0 "[From.GetName] Deescelates"
  nf_arm.22.d:0 "It looks like the people of Gloria can sleep soundly, knowing peace has prevailed. For now."
  nf_arm.22.a:0 "Peace in our time?"
 ################################
  nf_arm.23.t:0 "The Keys to Armageddon"
  nf_arm.23.d:0 "As a securitron handed over the keys to Mora, it grasped his hand softly, but firmly, with its claw, like a parent about to impart important wisdom on his child. \"Father believed in you all, more than you could ever know. He loved every single one of you, as much as He loved me. You have trusted me with the fate of Mexico and its people. And so, I trust you with the fate of the new world. I beg of you, do not sully what remains of his memory\" The airlock leading to Armageddon Station fell silent, until Mora spoke. \n\n\"General\" He said \"In his last moments, your father had only kindness in his heart for the people of the Rio Grande. I intend to return it in kind.\" The claw's grip slowly relaxed, and so it was done. Rio would hold the keys to Mexico's future."
  nf_arm.23.a:0 "Death to our enemies!"
 ################################
  nf_arm.24.t:0 "The Keys to Armageddon"
  nf_arm.24.d:0 "Rio had fallen. Rosado has been executed outside of her dark laboratory, found trying to experiment on the program that created Tlaloc. Guerra and his forces have surrendered, or now resorting to guerilla tactics desperately trying to fend off the steel legions, and Mora has been taken prisoner. Now, at last, Santa Anna's conquest was done. Now, at last, Armageddon station, as well as it's secrets, were safe."
  nf_arm.24.a:0 "Bueno, Muy Bueno."
 #################################
  nf_arm.25.t:0 "The Fate of Petro Chico"
  nf_arm.25.d:0 "As [ITZ.GetLeader] stirs and prepares to march north, Santa Anna has been forced to create a buffer for Northern Mexico. Sadly the people of Petro Chico, if left to their own devices, will be a roadblock. If harnessed to Santa Anna's war machine, however, they can be a valuable resource!  \nSanta Anna could take Petro Chico alone, or he can propose one of his brothers join him in an alliance. After all, Moctezuma has his own reasons to oppose the Mayans."
  nf_arm.25.a:0 "We can handle the Tribals without our brother."
  nf_arm.25.b:0 "Not the last of the Mexica; the first of the Mexicans."
 #################################
  nf_arm.26.t:0 "Moctezuma's Next Flower War"
  nf_arm.26.d:0 "Our brother Santa Anna has asked us to join him in dividing Petro Chico, and uniting against the Mayans. This might risk a war with the Mayans, but Santa Anna offers us [775.GetName]. Control of that province brings us to the borders of Tenochtitlan, the sacred homeland the Aztlans call Mexico City."
  nf_arm.26.a:0 "Together we will bring a rich harvest to Southern Hummingbird."
  nf_arm.26.b:0 "Sorry brother, we have other plans."
 #################################
 #################################
  nf_arm.27.t:0 "[RRG.GetLeader] Rejected My Offer!"
  nf_arm.27.d:0 "Recting any hope for peace, Mora has declared war upon Ejercito Mexicano. Was Father wrong then? Do humans really care about nothing else than war, and what they can acquire from it?"
  nf_arm.27.a:0 "I guess some things never change..."
  ################################
  nf_arm.28.t:0 "The General Stirs"
  nf_arm.28.d:0 "[ARM.GetLeader] has slumbered south of the Rio Grande since he helped drive off the Legion incursion ten years ago.  But for some reason, he has begun to stir. Conscripts and the steel legions of the general have been sighted on the river's southern banks, and press gangs have been stockpiling food and fuel. Time will tell what he is up to. "
  nf_arm.28.a:0 "Umm, what?"
  nf_arm.28.b:0 "This is moderately concerning."
  nf_arm.28.c:0 "Wait, aren't we across the river?"

  nf_arm.29.t:0 "Settle Down Son"
  nf_arm.29.d:0 "[ARM.GetLeader] has solved a contractor dispute across the Rio Grande. Although we admire his eagerness, Petro Chico's jurisdiction does not extend to prewar territory. We will have to instruct him to withdraw his forces."
  nf_arm.29.a:0 "That could affect this year's budget forecasts!"
  #################################
  nf_arm.30.t:0 "[TLA.GetLeader] instructs us to withdraw."
  nf_arm.30.d:0 "Father has noticed our intervention across the Rio Grande and told us we must withdraw. He still does not understand that Mexico's destiny lies in reclaiming its rightful territories! But we will listen to him, for now. \n\nOn the bright side, Mexico's people are grateful that we put the lodge out of commission."

  nf_arm.34.d:0 "[PER.GETLeader] has refused to stand down, and decided that they will resist me to their last breath. Fair enough, I didn't expect such idiotic savages to know when they are beaten. Deploy the steel legions, as well as my armies. Burn their cities to the ground. Texas shall fall."
  nf_arm.34.a:0 "Forward!"
  #################################
  nf_arm.35.t:0 "A Visit from the General"
  nf_arm.35.d:0 "It would appear that Santa Anna, the so-called 'mad general' of Mexico, has a proposal for us. His securitrons and caravans arrived bearing many gifts, mainly mountains of advanced military equipment and weaponry. Their demands in exchange for such priceless treasures? They want us to kill as many members of the Texan Brotherhood as possible.  That's it, that's the offer. It's certainly an... interesting deal."
  nf_arm.35.a:0 "Carthage must be preserved."

  nf_arm.36.t:0 "The Fall of Chichen Itza"
  nf_arm.36.d:0  "Chichen Itza lied bloodied and broken, humbled by Santa Anna's armies and cast down to their knees. For decades the savages daring to call themselves a 'civilization' went against Father's will, and wrought war upon the peaceful nation of Mexico, slaughtering enemies and innocents alike in their quest for power. All Tlaloc could do short of outright annihilation was allow them to tear the throat of their rival in bloody border conflicts, but it did little to delay the inevitable. With [ITZ.GETLeader] and his clique now pressed against a wall, a squad of wrathful militia member shouldering their rifles in anticipation of an execution, Santa Anna had two simple options. Carry on his father's work, and seek to pacify them by erasing their 'culture', bringing them into the fold of his more civilized nation. Or, if they really couldn't be expected to act like humans, treat them like the rabid dogs they are."
  nf_arm.36.a:0  "Jail [ITZ.GETLeader] and his officers, the others will learn in due time."
  nf_arm.36.a.tt:0 "May Father's teachings guide them upon a better path, just like they guided me to my destiny."
