With his advanced understanding of war drilled into the hearts and minds of our soldiers, how could we lose? We will conquer, conquer, and conquer some more... we'll turn the whole Wasteland red with blood and the banner of Caesar's Legion!"

But now with Caesar gone we need ask ourselves; is our way of life truly right?\n\nWhile Caesar was right to criticise the Old World's over-reliance on advanced technology, and his thesis on its downfall as a result is resolute, are we not the perfect society to arm itself with the trappings of America's corpse?\n\nOthers might exploit such riches, we would surely use them properly... but on the other hand, none but us could achieve the perfect balance between advanced weapons and traditional living. If we abandon our principles, are we sullying Caesar's legacy?\n\nThe question facing us is one as old as written history... the pen, or the sword?"

You've known your name since you were born, obviously.\n\nHe opens the book for you, how nice of him. He guides you to the right page, right where you need to write your name. Your men look at you curiously, expectantly, hungrily. They want you to do this, to do something. It's been difficult since the Kaiser arrived, things feel off somehow.

Only Caesar and Lanius know for sure, and they aren't talking. What is undeniable is that Lanius is among the greatest leaders of the Legion.

They prospered despite the Great War and its aftermath, forging a home in the Wasteland. \n\nNow the survivors tended their orchards under the eyes of the Legion, another in the line of their would-be conquerors. But Lanius would learn much from his foes, and even the Mescalero's former leader Lozen would admit he was not without  wisdom. For the Beast from the East believed imitation was the sincerest form of flattery."
   nf_lanius.9.a:0 "The Apache's nomadic ways will serve us well."

   nf_lanius.10.t:0 "The Land of Heart's Desire"
   nf_lanius.10.d:0 "Before the War, some called New Mexico the Land of Enchantment. But Lanius thought of it by an older name. Lanius learned to fight and conquer in Arizona; but it was in New Mexico he learned to rule. \n\nIt was not enough to crush an enemy in battle. Lanius learned what came after. Butchering a town would leave no one to feed the Legion; and slaves could not glory in his conquests. To that end, Lanius took the collar from Colorados' neck, and let the Executives' craftsmen forge new guns for the Cohort. And over time, the thoughts behind his mask began to change."

Lanius looked at it, the tales of hopes and fears, terrors and triumphs, without comment. After a moment, he looked at the man who knelt before him. 'Which of that blood, Dyed Blood, is your own? And which was from the Legion?' The man remained silent. 'Do not despair at your defeat, for you will be purified into something greater. Your men fought well and honourably, and shall find a new life! Your warriors have earned a place in my army; you shall serve us as part of something greater. And like me, you will look back, years from now, and wonder at how much of your life you wasted.' \n\nAs they watched, Legionaires poured red paint upon the rock. the history of a people vanished beneath the tide of red."

I know you can hear me, and I know you think you can outlast us. And perhaps, in another time, you might be right.' Lanius' mask remained motionless as he continued. 'We have found the tubes that bring air into your bunker. Too small for any of us, perhaps. But even as we speak, a gas is seeping into your bunker. Can your sons and daughters survive that? Or will you end your days with the corpses of your children, waiting for your suits to grow cold and take you too. Make your choice.'"

   nf_lanius.13.t:0 "Equal Rites"
   nf_lanius.13.d:0 "Great Caesar has never allowed women to serve as warriors, restricting their roles to healers, midwives, and scribes. But in his conquest of the East, Lanius has conquered many warrior women: Lozen of the Mescalero; Morrison of the Summer; and Brixley of the Brotherhood. They have fought at least as well as the tribes of Arizona, and there is no shame in falling to the Legion. Perhaps, wonders Lanius, he can use women for other roles? But as scouts? Spies, who do not pass word of Lanius' doings to Vulpes? As honoured scribes, who fight with words instead of weapons?"
   nf_lanius.13.a:0 "Caesar would never condone this!"

   nf_lanius.14.d:0 "With the destruction of the Hangdogs, Lanius must decide their fate. He could simply enslave them all, another banner beneath the feet of the Legion.

   nf_lanius.17.d:0 "Lanius has sent us a mighty ally from Dog City, a majestic hound he calls Rex. We shall honour Rex, and let him have the finest scraps from our table. (And perhaps seconds)."
   nf_lanius.17.a:0 "You could learn from him Vulpes."
   nf_lanius.17.a_tt:0 "This will lower Caesar's stress."

   nf_lanius.18.t:0 "More Plunder!"

   nf_lanius.19.t:0 "The Duel of Fates"
   nf_lanius.19.d:0 "The blade stood poised at Shale's throat, the mask impassive. Blade against blade, blow for blow, Lanius beat the super-mutant warlord into submission, in a fight that would only grow in the telling. 'There is no shame in falling,' declared the the Legate. 'Many graves in the East are filled with those with those who stood against me. Must I dig another?'  The super-mutants who watched their leader's next words would debate what happened next. Was Shale quiet? \n\nOr was it the loudest noise they had ever heard?"

   nf_lanius.20.t:0 "Don't Change that Channel!"
   nf_lanius.20.d:0 "And now ladies and gentlemen, let's give you an update on how those rebels against the Legion are faring, and ooh, it looks like another one has died on a cross! Truly, given the fate that awaits all who oppose Lanius, who would dare challenge his rule? And coming up next, we'll have a gladiator match between two tribals. Only one of them will be worthy of a role in the Legion, and who will be! But first, a word from our sponsors."

   nf_lanius.21.t:0 "Caesar's Will is Made Truth Through Me"
   nf_lanius.21.d:0 "Caesar's death shows what we knew all along; that even a god can die. Now his followers back west fight for the scraps, and we must decide what to do. We could help any of them, save Vulpes, whose treachery is no way to rule. But perhaps we should let them fight amongst each other? The Legion needs strength, and we could make the grave mistake of putting a weak ruler in place if we intervene.."

The former head of the Alamo Chapter, paraded in chains, the wagons of treasure pulled by super mutants... it was enough to take one's breath away. But in a tent with Caesar, Lanius felt free to speak his mind. 'The East was a hard-fought campaign. Even now, you draw too much of the Legion's blood needed there for Vegas. The Legion does not need Hoover Dam, or California. We can strike south, into Mexico. We can finish the Texans. Or we can bide our time for a couple of years, and strike for Chicago, at the last of the Old World!' \n\nLanius never spoke of Caesar's reaction, but it was undisputed that in the months to come, more advisors came east. Not just frumentarii; but technicians, scribes, those who could turn the East from a frontier into an empire. The Legion was here to stay."
