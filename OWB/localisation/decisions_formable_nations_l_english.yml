  form_motor_city_desc:0 "Ever since the NCR marched into the Mojave and Mr House's robots arose from their slumber, we've been forced to take refuge in Vault 3 and run our drug empire while avoiding Ranger patrols. Not only does this stifle our trade, but it also prevents us for embracing the motor as an efficient, reliable method of drug delivery. Should we conquer New Vegas and fend off the Californian menace, we'd have both reliable access to pre-war motor technology and a blooming market to trade to. Vegas would become our Motor City: the centre of our great drug empire."

Exhausted, most fled to join the Californian Republic, but a handful of us instead fled South and lived amongst the Ranchers of [ROOT.GetName]. However, the Legion has come once more. If we are able to fight them back even for a little, reclaiming Southern Phoenix and Two Sun, maybe we're fit to call ourselves the Arizona Rangers once more."
