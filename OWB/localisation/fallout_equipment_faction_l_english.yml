  # ACH (Alamo Chapter)
  ACH_energy_equipment_1: "Laser Pistol"
  ACH_energy_equipment_1_short: "Laser Pistol"
  ACH_energy_equipment_1_desc: "The AER9 was actually not the top laser rifle in service at the time of the Great War. The model line went up to the state-of-the-art AER12, which saw service in a handful of speciality units. The reason that the AER9 is much more commonly found is that it was much sturdier and more reliable than the models that followed."
  ACH_spec_ops_equipment_4: "Recon Armour"
  ACH_spec_ops_equipment_4_short: "Recon Armour"
  ACH_spec_ops_equipment_4_desc: "Originally designed to serve as the under-armour for T-45d power armour, recon armour is a vacuum-sealed asbestos jumpsuit that covers the entire body. While useful in its intended role, recon armour is renowned for being an effective armour for operations that require more mobility than traditional power armour can provide."
  ACH_spec_ops_equipment_5: "Composite Recon Armour"
  ACH_spec_ops_equipment_5_short: "Composite Recon Armour"
  ACH_spec_ops_equipment_5_desc: "By using advanced materials and construction techniques, we can produce recon armour that is both lighter and more durable than previous models."

  # ARM (Ejército Mexicano)
  ARM_ballistic_equipment_2:0 "Paciencia Rifle"
  ARM_ballistic_equipment_2_short:0 "AM Rifle"
  ARM_ballistic_equipment_2_desc:0 "Few adversaries would consider a hunting rifle to be dangerous, yet they are gravely mistaken. It's threat comes from the fact it is a rechambered bolt-action, made to fire a shortened anti-material round able to pierce straight through most obstacles, and even light armor. What it gains in recoil, it makes up for in sheer firepower."

  # ARR (Arroyo)
#  ARR_ballistic_equipment_2: "Marksman Rifle"
#  ARR_ballistic_equipment_2_short: "Marksman Rifle"
#  ARR_ballistic_equipment_2_desc: "Arroyo's proximity to the NCR gave them more than enough opportunities to acquire their standard Service Rifle, and tweak it to their heart's desire.

  ASS_ballistic_equipment_2_short:0 "Assault Shotgun"
  ASS_ballistic_equipment_2_desc:0 "A rugged, magazine-fed, ultra-compact shotgun, the Blackjack fires a standard twelve gauge round out of a minimum-spec barrel, allowing maximum dispersion at close quarter. The reinforced frame, lack of stock, and short profile makes it a perfect weapon for drive-by shooting, as well as bashing someone's eye socket in. Add a bayonet, and you got a wonderful pocket eviscerator."

  # BAG (Baggers)

  BDT_melee_equipment_1:0 "Cultist Knife"
  BDT_melee_equipment_1_short:0 "Cult Knife"
  BDT_melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "A magnificently crafted knife, it's esotheric properties make any person in it's presence feel unease and gnawing despair as it's sight. The handle is made of polished bones, imbued with tainted blood to give it a red color, while a wave-bladed edge gives it a horribly wounding effect on strike, akin to a serrated edge. Perfect to spill blood in It's name."
  BDT_melee_equipment_2:0 "Cultist Sword"
  BDT_melee_equipment_2_short:0 "Cult Sword"
  BDT_melee_equipment_2_desc:0 "The cultist sword follows the tradition of venerating It's name even in warfare, but forgoes the esotheric shaped blade of it's dagger counterpart for a straight serrated edge to more easily spill blood and tear flesh. With it's handle shaped from the bones of heretics, and supernatural forces blessing the blade, it's vile energy seeps into every warrior in it's presence."

  BOO_power_armour_equipment_4_short: "T-51b PA"
  BOO_power_armour_equipment_4_desc: "Based on the US Military's T-51b power armour but not manufactured in any significant number before the bombs fell, some vaults contain the encrypted schematics to produce more."

  # BOS (Brotherhood of Steel)
  BOS_melee_equipment_4: "Displacer Glove"
  BOS_melee_equipment_4_short: "Displacer Glove"
  BOS_melee_equipment_4_desc: "The displacer glove creates a shock wave upon impact similar to the one made by the Gauss rifle, both dealing a large amount of damage and pushing a target back. It possibly accomplishes this via a sonic blast, shown by the speaker on the knuckle."
  BOS_energy_equipment_1: "Laser Pistol"
  BOS_energy_equipment_1_short: "Laser Pistol"
  BOS_energy_equipment_1_desc: "The AER9 was actually not the top laser rifle in service at the time of the Great War.

  BOS_blimp_equipment_4_short:0 "Osceola Class"
  BOS_blimp_equipment_4_desc:0 "The pride of any post-war air force, a single Osceola Class Skyship is a force to be reckoned with, while several would be a yet-unseen projection of force across the wasteland. A flying military base capable of both aerial combat and air-to-surface bombardment, the Osceola is not just a superweapon, but also a symbol of military might."

  # BRK (Broken Coast)
  BRK_melee_equipment_1:0 "Fishbone"
  BRK_melee_equipment_1_short:0 "Fishbone"
  BRK_melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "Named for their menacing serrated edges and chalk white blades, fishbones are often made from the hulls of wrecked ships. Cheap, rusty metal often makes for the best shivs: the tetanus is an added bonus.\n\n"

  BRK_melee_equipment_2_short:0 "Gut Harpoon"
  BRK_melee_equipment_2_desc:0 "Despite their deadly appearance, these broken harpoon tips on sticks are little more than unbalanced blunt rods. They're a favourite of Broken Coast raiders for their intimidating aura and unpredictability.\n\n"
  BRK_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Black Powder Pistol"
  BRK_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "Old Sidearm"
  BRK_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The lack of resources, weapon knowledge and manufacturing availability made flintlocks a common sight amongst the Broken Coast. Beyond it's simple sidearm function, a weighted grip makes it perfect for pistol-whipping during boarding, and a wide barrel let daring pirates load it with buckshot, before shredding any unlucky enemy in a blinding light and deafening blast."
  BRK_ballistic_equipment_1:0 "Little Marie"
  BRK_ballistic_equipment_1_short:0 "Little Marie"
  BRK_ballistic_equipment_1_desc:0 "Pistol sized shotguns that pack a bunch large enough to puncture holes in wooden ships, Little Maries are carried by every pirate worth his salt. Sickeningly, the name comes from a local folk tale about a girl who used a shotgun to murder her father.\n\n"
  BRK_ballistic_equipment_2:0 "Redbeard Cannon"
  BRK_ballistic_equipment_2_short:0 "Redbeard Cannon"
  BRK_ballistic_equipment_2_desc:0 "The feared Captain Redbeard from Port Maw inspired terror and awe in all who crossed him, the snap of his lever action rifle never leaving the men who faced him. So fearsome was his time at sea, that even decades after his demise, lever action rifles are still associated with him.\n\n"
  BRK_ballistic_equipment_3:0 "Sailor's Carbine"
  BRK_ballistic_equipment_3_short:0 "Sailor's Carbine"
  BRK_ballistic_equipment_3_desc:0 "Only the very bravest, or the very stupid, venture north into the frozen waters of Alaska. Those who return from the voyage bring back with them many bounties, one of which is always a Sailor's Carbine. Rare prewar weapons found only in the north, they are a mark of prestige, and possess deadly killing power.\n\n"

  BRK_energy_equipment_1:0 "Madman's Musket"
  BRK_energy_equipment_1_short:0 "Madman's Musket"
  BRK_energy_equipment_1_desc:0 "It takes a truly desperate man to strap a reaction chamber to a crank, duct-tape on a trigger, and face down the pirates knocking at his door—but that's what Madman Jack once did, or so they say. Laser muskets are popular among smarter crews who know the best spots for tech salvage.\n\n"
  BRK_energy_equipment_2:0 "Powder Monkey"
  BRK_energy_equipment_2_short:0 "Powder Monkey"
  BRK_energy_equipment_2_desc:0 "For the few pirate crews who make use of energy weapons and succeed in their dangerous careers, the next step is improving their weapons. With all manner of tech scrap at their disposal, the results vary wildly, but they are almost always deadly... for both the shooter and the victim!\n\n"

  BRK_energy_equipment_3_short:0 "Plaslock Pistol"
  BRK_energy_equipment_3_desc:0 "Uncovering plasma weaponry is an achievement any man should boast until his dying days, and for a pirate this is especially true. The men and women of the Broken Coast know one thing to be true: all good pirates carry flintlocks. To any vermin who gets their grubby hands on a plasma pistol, its true name be damned, it's a Plaslock!\n\n"

  # CES (Caesar's Legion)
  CES_melee_equipment_1:0 "Machete"
  CES_melee_equipment_1_short:0 "Machete"

  CES_melee_equipment_2: "Machete Gladius"
  CES_melee_equipment_2_short: "Machete Gladius"

  CES_melee_equipment_3_short: "Bumper Sword"
  CES_melee_equipment_3_desc: "The bumper sword, as the name suggests, consists of a rusty car bumper that has been flattened and sharpened into a thick, heavy blade. The license plate is still attached, and an exhaust pipe strapped to the unsharpened end serves as a makeshift handle."
  CES_melee_equipment_4: "Ballistic Fist"
  CES_melee_equipment_4_short: "Ballistic Fist"

  CES_power_armour_equipment_2_desc: "Designed to invoke the fury of Mars in battle, the Brotherhood of Mars created this variant of T-51b to outfit their legions with in the coming wars. Its mediocre materials make it worse in battle than regular T-51b, but for equipment designed by former luddites, it is exceptional."
  CES_heavy_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Slave Collars"
  CES_heavy_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "Slave Collars"
  CES_heavy_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The total pacification collar (commonly referred to as a slave collar) is a pre-War prisoner control device developed at Big MT Research and Development Center, and adapted by slavers after the war for the purpose of capturing and forcing slaves into submission."

  # CHC (Chained Choir)
#  CHC_melee_equipment_1: "Prison Shiv"
#  CHC_melee_equipment_1_short: "Shiv"
#  CHC_melee_equipment_1_desc: "More commonly seen in the hands of prisoners trying to silence snitches than as mass produced weapon of war, the prison shiv is a simple improvised blade made primarily for piercing and stabbing than slashing at foes. It's deadly nature comes from the vicious tactics used alongside it, with wearers used to go for the jugular or arteries than fight fair."
  CHC_ballistic_equipment_1: "9mm Submachine Gun"
  CHC_ballistic_equipment_1_short: "9mm SMG"
  CHC_ballistic_equipment_1_desc: "The 9mm submachine gun is a classic that hardly needs an introduction. Improving upon the basic package, a telescopic assembly reduces it's size further, while higher quality cartridges crafted with increased powder load allows enhanced muzzle velocity and effect on soft target. Spray and Pray has never been this much fun."
  
  # CLK (Clockwatchers / TimeKeepers)
  CLK_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Pipe Revolver"
  CLK_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "Revolver"
  CLK_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "From need comes ingenuity. While the clockwatchers appreciate immense firepower, it is certainly hard to acquire it, much less standardize it. Using scrap metal and abandonned forge around their territory, they managed to manufacture this huge, bulky sidearm, barely holding together with every shot of it's massive 200 grain .38 cartridge."
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_1:0 ".44 Revolver"
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_1_short:0 ".44"
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_1_desc:0 "As improvements came along to the standard Clockwatcher weaponry, a massive change was in order. The proper metal frame, reinforced cylinder, and elongated barrel makes this weapon a sight to behold. Firing the same .38 caliber cartridge, with improved recoil control and accuracy, means the same devastating stopping power in a reliable package."
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_2:0 "Improved .44 Revolver"
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_2_short:0 ".44 Improved"
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_2_desc:0 "Very little can be considered "improvement" when it comes to Clockwatcher weaponry, at least to them. As such, this sidearm was only called "Improved" when a crafty weaponsmith managed to have what amounts to a battle pistol fire a 350 grain, .44 cartridge without the whole gun going up with his hands. While pre-war movies tended to exaggerate their effect, this revolver can actually blow someone clear across a room"
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_3:0 "Revolver Rifle"
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_3_short:0 ".44 Carbine"
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_3_desc:0 "There comes a point in every revolver development where a hard limit is, sadly, reached in terms of firepower. Thankfully, that's where carbine convertions generally come in. With a solid stock, center-line assembly and elongated barrel, this revolver carbine can not only provide a more stable firing platform, but increase firepower even further by firing a full-length, super magnum .44 cartridge more commonly seen fired from heavy rifles."
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_4:0 "Railway Rifle"
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_4_short:0 "Pain Train"
  CLK_ballistic_equipment_4_desc:0 "An extremely bulky yet curious contraption, this converted railway spike driver has been fitted with a stock, barrel, and stand-alone power unit to be able to fire it's spike at long range. When bullets could no longer satisfy the Clockwatcher's need for increased firepower, this was a natural choice for a replacement. The spike itself is propelled at revolver-like velocity, themselves being huge .62 caliber metal rods able to literally nail an enemy to a wall."

  # CRA (51 Zetans)

  CRA_melee_equipment_4_short: "Zetan Probe"
  CRA_melee_equipment_4_desc: "The foolish earthlings think us weak in close quarter, owing to our small stature and frail constitution, but we haven't conquered the galaxy through intelligence alone!

  CRA_energy_equipment_1:0 "Zetan Blaster"
  CRA_energy_equipment_1_short:0 "Zetan Blaster"
  CRA_energy_equipment_1_desc:0 "Far beyond anything the foolish earthlings could ever produce, this wonder of Zetan engineering consists of a contained plas-tomic field able to fire projectiles much faster than any primitive firearm! It's powerful plas-tomic blasts destabilize in contact of any squishy inferior target, cooking their insides and roasting their skin to a crisp."
  CRA_energy_equipment_2:0 "Zetan Atomizer"
  CRA_energy_equipment_2_short:0 "Zetan Atomizer"
  CRA_energy_equipment_2_desc:0 "The standard Zetan sidearm, owing to it's more advanced containment field capabilities, the Atomizer owe it's name to the many weapon tests carried out on foolish earthling captives to see exactly how much atomization the weapon is truly capable off. The tests were obviously very lengthy just to make sure, and the answer was, obviously, a hell of a lot."
  CRA_energy_equipment_3:0 "Zetan Disintegrator"
  CRA_energy_equipment_3_short:0 "Zetan Disintegrator"
  CRA_energy_equipment_3_desc:0 "An absolute classic when it comes to foolish earthling extermination, the Disintegrator is the perfect long rifles to snipe at fleeing inferior beings or outright incinerate them into a pile of ash in open combat. Many earthlings think themselves safe inside their power armor, and combat suits. Let's see how safe they feel when said power armor shatters and disembowel them!"

  TIM_melee_equipment_1_short:0 "Hatchet"
  TIM_melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "A handheld bladed weapon, the hatchet is compact, light, and versatile. Contrary to typical pre-war examples, this weapon has been customized for military purposes. A special tapped handle assures a firm grip while in combat, with a large sharpened edge on one side for unarmoured targets, and spike on the other to pierce straight through metal armor."
  TIM_melee_equipment_2:0 "Fireaxe"
  TIM_melee_equipment_2_short:0 "Axe"
  TIM_melee_equipment_2_desc:0 "Usually used to break down doors in case of emergency, the robust construction and dual-purpose blade is made more deadly by the addition of a weighted axe head, letting any swing that connect either pierce huge holes into armor, or cleaving through limbs like nothing. "
  TIM_melee_equipment_3:0 "Fusion-Powered Chainsaw"
  TIM_melee_equipment_3_short:0 "Chainsaw"
  TIM_melee_equipment_3_desc:0 "Multiple convertions to this pre-war tool made it a deadly close-combat weapon that few fighters dare approach. An alloy frame combined with a converted fusion engine made to receive military-grade laser sidearm capacitors considerably lighten it, while the increased power draw and carbide-alloy teeth can make it tear through even power armor with enough force."

  # TPM (The Patrolmen)

  TPM_ballistic_equipment_1_short: "Trapdoor Springfield"
  TPM_ballistic_equipment_1_desc: "Extremely hard to use, older than dirt, and with a kick that would shatter a civilian's arm, the Model 1873 Springfield is a single-shot, trapdoor-loading design, chambered for a newer smokeless version of the mighty .45-70. With double the firepower and triple the recoil of a conventional 7.62mm, it certainly builds up character to train with such a weapon."
  TPM_ballistic_equipment_2: "Single Action Revolver"
  TPM_ballistic_equipment_2_short: "Peacemaker"
  TPM_ballistic_equipment_2_desc: "The modern variant of a revolver so beloved it's production was restarted thrice, this single-action six-shot revolver is revered by it's users for it's compact wrist-breaking firepower, quick-loading cylinder removal system, and being cheap enough to simply carry many of them into battle. Loaded in .45 colt, preferred use still is and always will be to shoot one from each hand."

  TTM_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Recurve Bow"
  TTM_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "A simple wooden recurve bow, this weapon's deadliness mostly comes from the Twin Mothers tribe's accuracy with them. Able to snipe at target far beyond what regular bowmen would be able to, they can easily pull enemy troops into deadly ambushes and skirmishes."
  TTM_ballistic_equipment_1: "Advanced Recurve Bow"
  TTM_ballistic_equipment_1_short: "Commando Bow"
  TTM_ballistic_equipment_1_desc: "A shorter composite recurve bow allows Twin Mothers soldiers to move more swiftly, and benefit from better manoeuvrability because of the weapon's smaller profile. All that while still benefiting from powerful draw capabilities able to launch an arrow right through most armor."

  TTM_ballistic_equipment_2_short: "Compound Bow"
  TTM_ballistic_equipment_2_desc: "Simple systems of pulleys added to a composite short bow result in this deadly weapon able to not only store twice to thrice the kinetic energy, but also integrate a simple pull trigger system to 'pre-load' arrows, allowing accurate aiming and shooting while saving the stamina of the bowman. "
  TTM_ballistic_equipment_3: "Explosive Bow"
  TTM_ballistic_equipment_3_short: "Explosive Bow"
  TTM_ballistic_equipment_3_desc: "More advanced pulley systems result in higher velocity and thus accuracy, while improving the arrow design lessens the chance of a deflection upon armor. The main improvement in this design comes from replacing the arrowhead with an explosive. Having no need for propellant, the overall content of the bursting charge far surpasses the ones of even infantry grenades."
  TTM_ballistic_equipment_4: "Piercing Warhead Bow"
  TTM_ballistic_equipment_4_short: "Piercing Bow"
  TTM_ballistic_equipment_4_desc: "The addition of a reinforced base, as well as a simple copper liner, allows the explosive warhead to concentrate it's blast on a single point. The combination of its silent operation, high velocity and piercing capabilities makes it far above even firearms in ambush combat, able to blow fist-sized holes through even power armor, not even mentioning the effect against soft target."

  TUB_ballistic_equipment_1_desc: "For those that have the know-how and the strength to fire it, this compact sidearm is the ultimate end-all in term of pistol-sized firepower. An impeccable and striking classic rechambered for the American .50 Action Express, and fitted with a short barrel, it's target shooting shooting heritage leaves it with few cartridges in the mag, and a bulky frame. But for some, the fact it kicks like a mule on both sides of the barrel is all that matters."

  UFO_energy_equipment_2:0 "Zetan Atomizer"
  UFO_energy_equipment_2_short:0 "Zetan Atomizer"
  UFO_energy_equipment_2_desc:0 "The standard Zetan sidearm, owing to it's more advanced containment field capabilities, the Atomizer owe it's name to the many weapon tests carried out on foolish earthling captives to see exactly how much atomization the weapon is truly capable off. The tests were obviously very lengthy just to make sure, and the answer was, obviously, a hell of a lot."

  VEG_ballistic_equipment_1_desc: "The 9mm submachine gun is a classic that hardly need an introduction. Improving upon the basic package, a telescopic assembly reduces it's size further, while higher quality cartridges crafted with increased powder load allows enhanced muzzle velocity and effect on soft target. Spray and Pray has never been this much fun."
  VEG_energy_equipment_3: "Laser Rapid Capacitor Weapon"
  VEG_energy_equipment_3_short: "Laser RCW"
  VEG_energy_equipment_3_desc: "The Laser Rapid Capacitor Weapon uses a drum containing six capacitors centered around an electron charge pack. The drum spins as the weapon fires, producing a continuous laser beam while simultaneously using the electron charge pack to recharge previously discharged capacitors. The design allows the Laser RCW to achieve rates of fire unavailable to single capacitor designs."
