  TWO_OWB_DESC: "Founded upon the Ruins of Tucson, the formerly second largest City in Arizona, Two Sun has since developed their previous obsession for motor sport into an outright religious movement the Cult of Nas. They have since then become a client state of the legion, venerating Caesar as part of their Pantheon, making themselves indispensable to his cause by carrying his wrath across the wastes on their impressive vehicles.\nTwo Suns entire culture revolves around the race track and they seek to hold nothing short of the Greatest Race of all time, with the greatest racers of the wasteland all in attendance."
