  rrg_idea_texas_arms_fams:0 "Texan Arms Families"
  rrg_idea_texas_arms_fams_desc:0 "The Republic of the Rio Grande had no arms industry at its inception. Rather than train people for the job, Colonel Griffin recruited experienced Texans from the land he liberated soon after the Great War. This has created a problem in the modern day, as the Texan Arms Association continues to lobby for its own interests, disrupting the process of democracy, and pocketing most of the Republic's wealth for itself."
  rrg_idea_mexican_spirit:0 "Mexican Spirit"
  rrg_idea_mexican_spirit_desc:0 "The Mexican soldiers who formed the core of the early Republic passed down their knowledge of the land and their love for their country. Today, the Republic of the Rio Grande trains its soldiers outdoors extensively, continuing to teach a love for and knowledge of Mexico's geography."
  rrg_idea_paullus_raiders:0 "Paullus' Raiders"
  rrg_idea_paullus_raiders_desc:0 "After his defeat at the hands of President Mora, and with most of his men either dead or fleeing to Texas, Paullus opted to stay behind and work his way back up from the bottom. His few remaining men are loyal, hardened fighters, who stalk the northern regions of the Republic looking for prey. Unless they're properly dealt with, these hardened warriors turn raiders could spiral into a major issue."
  rrg_idea_vencedores_night:0 "Vencedores"
  rrg_idea_vencedores_night_desc:0 "President Mora's expert use of darkness in his assault was key to his victory over the Legionnaires. The tactical mastery displayed throughout the operation has endured, solidified by Mora's later reforms to the military. All soldiers are taught about the importance of stealth, reconnaissance, and the element of surprise. Darkness is not a hindrance, it is a helper."
  rrg_idea_vencedores_rocks:0 "Vencedores"
  rrg_idea_vencedores_rocks_desc:0 "President Mora's expert use of the terrain in his assault was key to his victory over the Legionnaires. The tactical mastery displayed throughout the operation has endured, solidified by Mora's later reforms to the military. All soldiers are taught about the importance of natural terrain, proper footwork, and using your surroundings to your advantage. A Mexican soldier always has the high ground, no matter where he stands."
  rrg_idea_rgrb:0 "RGRB"
  rrg_idea_rgrb_desc:0 "The Rio Grande Reclamation Bureau was established by the first President of the Republic in order to capture and repair pre-war structures. Its core of engineers specialise in renovating pre-war facilities, and holding a position within the RGRB is a sign of pride for many within the Republic."
  rrg_idea_rgrb_mod:0 "RGRB"
  rrg_idea_rgrb_mod_desc:0 "The Rio Grande Reclamation Bureau was established by the first President of the Republic in order to capture and repair pre-war structures. Recently, its engineers have begun to prioritise renovating pre-war arms manufacturing equipment."

  rrg_national_crisis:0 "National Crisis"
  rrg_national_crisis_desc:0 "For the first time in the history of the Republic, our capital city, Gloria, has been laid siege to. The dead clog our streets, the bridge that signified unity across the Rio Grande River is burning, and nobody knows what the future holds."
  rrg_stabilization:0 "Stabilization"
  rrg_stabilization_desc:0 "In the wake of one of the most destabilising events in our history, many of our citizens are steadily beginning to withdraw assets from our financial institutions, which has the risk of destabilising the situation further. To prevent the worst from coming to pass, the government has frozen all transactions, and has informed caravan companies to continue operations as normal."

  rrg_new_deal_idea:0 "Avila's New Deal"
  rrg_new_deal_idea_desc:0 "Without thorough support, our population will never recover from this crises. In times of need, it's the government's job to support the citizenry, and vice-versa. By instituting a series of daring policy reforms, bailing out key industrial leaders, and encouraging private citizens to place their wealth back in the hands of the government, we'll make it out of this crises intact."
  rrg_economic_crackdown1:0 "The Economic Crackdown"
  rrg_economic_crackdown_1:0 "Hard times require harder austerity measures. In order to address the situation at had, we must first have control of all the assets at our disposal. By seizing businesses that have gone bankrupt, and promising to absolve personal debt for military recruits over a four year period, we might just be able to salvage the economy."
  rrg_economic_crackdown2:0 "The Economic Crackdown"
  rrg_economic_crackdown2_desc:0 "With our assets reclaimed, fierce austerity measures are no longer necessary, but the legacy of our actions remains in their place. Our decision to absolve debt for servicemen of four years or longer has fostered an economically driven recruitment culture among our nation's less fortunate. Thankfully, this has lead to wider national support of our military's efforts, a great boon in these trying times."

The aftermath of the Day of the Dead are with us even now, and the people look to us, their Government, to support them now, and beyond. By using our actions during the crisis as a foundation, we can begin to offer long-term contracts to our workforce, facilitating healthy economic growth across the nation."
