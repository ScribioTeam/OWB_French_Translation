 shi_shi_huang_ti_desc:9 "The ancestors of the present-day Shi were the crewmen of a Chinese submarine, the Shi-Huang-Ti, that was beached in San Francisco shortly after the Great War. Despite the extreme levels of radiation persisting in the burning ruins of the city, they managed to establish a foothold in the city (in the former Chinatown, no less). Gradually, the submarine was stripped of its subsystems, as they found a new purpose serving the Shi, as the group of survivors came to call themselves. The Emperor, the fabled leader of the Shi is settled in the "Steel Palace", a citadel created from metal salvaged from the submarine."

 shi_ghosts_of_the_pacific_desc:9 "Off the coast of San Francisco lies one of the most volatile places in the Wasteland. In 2073 The United States won the international race to establish a platform in a key location off the coast of San Francisco ( After sabotaging Chinese efforts to do so ).\nThis location was one of the world's last known major pockets of oil, thought to be unreachable due to it being located thousands of feet below the seabed.  During the nuclear storm of the Great War, the United State's most important members and essential personnel were evacuated to this location.\nThe Poseidon Oil Rig in the Pacific Ocean was chosen as a secret base from which the USA could continue to exist and wage war on China, with the eventual goal of retaking the continental United States. As the world burned and the United States disintegrated, its president and the “Enclave” remnants of the pre-War American shadow government, established themselves as its continuation, claiming authority over the United States mainland.\n\nThat is, until the Chosen One stopped them. A hero in their own right - this champion would cause a melt down to occur from within the Oil Rig, effectively dooming the Enclave in California. The Shi, over the waning years since then have learned much of the Enclave. Studying the aeronautic, botanical and metallurgy secrets of this shadowy, forgotten organization."
