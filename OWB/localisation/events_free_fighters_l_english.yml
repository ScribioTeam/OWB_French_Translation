  nf_ffi.1.t:0 "The Last Luchadore"
  nf_ffi.1.d:0 "Thirty Years after the end of the world, a small tribal community is terrorized and enslaved by local banditos. However, this situation changes when a lone figure in a white mask wanders into town, and dares to challenge the banditos. Despite all odds, the figure drives off the banditos, only to sucumb to his wounds in the aftermath of the battle. His sacrifice would inspire generations of tribals to take up masks and fight their oppressors, with his dying words carrying them into the future."

  nf_ffi.2.t:0 "Return of the Demon"
  nf_ffi.2.d:0 "The return of El Santo and his sacrifice would go on to inspire a tribal uprising that forced the local banditos into exile and defeat, with the singular exception of one warband. These warriors adopted the masks and tactics of their enemies, fashioning themselves after the Blue Demon that once challenged El Santo. While antagonistic towards their fellows, none can deny the place the Blue Demons have earned in Free Fighter society. For they are willing to do what must be done."

  nf_ffi.3.t:0 "A Monster with a Hundred Masks"
  nf_ffi.3.d:0 "The arrival of the great wanderer broke a hundred years of status quo among the warring tribes of the Free Fighters, for this great foe was greater than any who had come to threaten them before. Easily defeating several chiefs in single combat, the monster claimed the masks of his defeated foes, establishing himself as the new leader of their tribes. To all who inquired, he made his goals clear. He sought to form an army with which to defeat The Legion of the far north."

  nf_ffi.4.t:0 "The Tag Team of the Century"
  nf_ffi.4.d:0 "The last match for leadership of the Free Fighters ended with no clear winner, and yet it remains the greatest match the Federation has ever seen. El Santo and the Blue Demon faced each other in the Los Mochis ring, trading blow for blow. Just as El Santo was to claim victory, from the crowds emerged the Green Giant himself! Mil Mascaras leaped into the ring, and it was only through their combined power that the Blue Demon and El Santo were able to force him to a draw. When the dust had settled on the ruined remains of what had once been the Los Mochis ring, a new fellowship was formed: Las Tres Mascaras would rule the federation as equals, until they faced each other in the ring again."
  nf_ffi.4.a:0 "What a match!"

  nf_ffi.5.t:0 "Division in the Federation"
  nf_ffi.5.d:0 "Not everyone has accepted the results of the great match. Even now, talk circulates amongst the tribe, questioning the fitness of La Tres Mascaras to lead the federation. Before the leadership of the federation can be decided once and for all, we must work together to unify our people."
  nf_ffi.5.a:0 "Hearts and Minds, people."

  nf_ffi.6.t:0 "The Unbowed"
  nf_ffi.6.d:0 "Not all of the lucha tribes have accepted the rule of La Tres Mascaras, three groups yet remain who we will need to unite under our banner: Las Medicinas, the Shadow Walkers, and the Two-Faced Warriors. Each of these tribes will need to be convinced to work with us, one way or another."
  nf_ffi.6.a:0 "They'll come around, eventually."

  nf_ffi.7.t:0 "Dealing with the Shadow Walkers"
  nf_ffi.7.d:0 "The Shadow Walkers worship the Black Shadow, an ancient evil who is said to have done battle with El Santo on numerous occasions, only to eventually be defeated by the great hero of old. Traditionally unwilling to work with the Federation, the recent addition of the Blue Demons have opened up unexpected dialogues with the Shadow Walkers, for their patron god is once said to have worked closely with the Blue Demon. The Shadow Walkers are willing to side with the Federation, provided that the Blue Demon Cult push to earn them pardons for the various crimes they have committed in their long history of wars with the Cult of El Santo. While the Cult of the Saints is willing to make some sacrifices, they are unwilling to pardon them all..."

  nf_ffi.8.t:0 "The Demon and the Nightmare"
  nf_ffi.8.d:0 "In the final, traditional act to bond the Shadow Walkers into the Federation, a public combat must be held between the leaders of their tribe and another. In time honored tradition, the Blue Demon has stepped forward to challenge the Black Shadow, intent on defeating him in a swift and decisive way. Their brawl is unlike most in the Federation, as it makes use of extensive outside equipment and interference, even as both parties wear armour and bring hidden weapons into the fray. When the dust finally settles, the Blue Demon stands triumphant over his foe, and the Black Shadow formally joins the federation… once he recovers from his broken arm."
  nf_ffi.8.a:0 "The Shadows Walk among us."

  nf_ffi.9.t:0 "Approaching the Medicinas"
  nf_ffi.9.d:0 "The Medicinas are, after the followers of El Santo, the most beloved of the Free Fighter tribes in the eyes of the common people under their protection, which is why their refusal to join the federation has caused such turmoil in the lands. The Medicinas worship the long lost Doctor Wagnar, a philanthropist wrestler from long before the war, and follow in his footsteps by offering medical treatments and charity work to those who need it. Among the tribes, they are easily the least interested in aggressive expansion or open conflict with their foes. It can be none other than El Santo who must bridge the gap with this tribe, and stress upon them the importance of protecting others."
  nf_ffi.9.a:0 "Beloved Doctor Gonzalez agrees."
  nf_ffi.9.b:0 "Honorable Surgeon Rivera agrees."

  nf_ffi.10.t:0 "Battle of Paragons"
  nf_ffi.10.d:0 "The traditional final conflict and step in gaining true membership into the federation is to be a wrestling match between a leader of the federation and the leader of the tribe itself. After brief discussion, it is agreed that El Santo shall do battle with Doctor Wagnar at a highly publicized and advertised charity event, the gains of which are going to be used to help fund the recently finished hospital. The Conflict between these two can be considered Lucha at its purest, lacking in any underhanded tactics and with numerous moments of incredible respect between the two. The result of this conflict is inevitable however, as Doctor Wagnar is far less a warrior than his contemporary in the heroic El Santo, who ends the match by helping his beaten foe stand."
  nf_ffi.10.a:0 "Can you smell what the Doc is cooking?"

  nf_ffi.11.t:0 "Twinned Trouble."
  nf_ffi.11.d:0 "The Two Faced tribe worships Dos Caras, also known as Two Masks, who was said to have been one of the largest and most powerful wrestlers of his age. It is pride that keeps them from bowing to the federation, and an unrelenting belief in their own superiority. Mil Mascaras, whose namesake once did battle at the side of Dos Caras, believes that the easiest way to bring the Twin Chieftains into the fold is to defeat the members of their tribe one by one in order to assert dominance. "

  nf_ffi.11.b:0 "Mighty Dos Rodriguez bows to the Federation"

  nf_ffi.12.t:0 "The Twins and the Giant"
  nf_ffi.12.d:0 "After defeating the majority of the elders within the Two Faced Warriors, Mil Mascaras challenged the twinned leaders of the tribe to combat, offering to fight them both at the same time for the sake of fairness. This match takes place in the center of the Federation’s greatest camp, under the watchful eyes of every chief who has bowed to the federation thus far. Though valiant, even the mighty twins can’t hope to match up to the raw physical might of the supermutant in unarmed combat, and are both defeated when a devastating slam renders one of the brothers unconscious, and the other pinned beneath his massive frame. With their prides firmly checked, the Two Faced Warriors agree to join the federation."
  nf_ffi.12.a:0 "Two heads are better than one. (For a double Piledriver)"

  nf_ffi.13.t:0 "Demon's Due"
  nf_ffi.13.d:0 "Despite the dishonor in his victory, the Blue Demon has emerged the victor of the great rematch. Many in the federation murmur about the foul play, and the grevious wounds that El Santo and Mil Mascaras suffered as a result, but none can deny his victory. Hopefully, the unity of having a sole leader will outweigh any damage in the trust the tribes have in the federation."
  nf_ffi.13.a:0 "Victory, but at what cost?"

  nf_ffi.14.t:0 "Champion Declared"
  nf_ffi.14.d:0 "Choosing his moments carefully, El Santo managed to achieve the impossible: a total victory against both the Blue Demon and Mil Mascaras. Such a success surely indicates divine favour, and the people of the federation once again flock to him as their saviour."
  nf_ffi.14.a:0 "A victory for the people!"

  nf_ffi.15.t:0 "Off the Top Ropes"
  nf_ffi.15.d:0 "This time, there was no tag team to stop Mil Mascaras from achieving his victory. Leaping off the top ropes, the Green Giant demolished both El Santo and the Blue Demon, his pure strength and indominitable will have won over many nonbelievers, who now flock to his tribe."
  nf_ffi.15.a:0 "Honestly, I saw that coming."

  nf_ffi.16.t:0 "The Baja Proposal"
  nf_ffi.16.d:0 "Whether by by bandits, or foreign occupiers, the people of Mexico have been subjugated for over 200 years. The latest tyrants, a so-called 'republic' from California, has recently taken control over the Baja territories, driving out the local bandits, while we could always liberate this land by force, it may be worth simply asking them if they'd turn the land over to us, in exchange for an alliance."
  nf_ffi.16.a:0 "Perhaps we can make a proposal."
  nf_ffi.16.b:0 "We will fight them for it!"

  nf_ffi.17.t:0 "The Baja Proposal"
  nf_ffi.17.d:0 "Our recent annexation of the Baja territories has put us into contact with some...unique individuals. The latest, a group of mexican wrestlers claiming to be vigilantes, has half asked, half demanded that we return the Baja to their 'free' control. In return for economic concessions and a defense pact."
  nf_ffi.17.a:0 "Well, we weren't doing anything with that land anyway."
  nf_ffi.17.b:0 "The NCR does not negotiate with wrestlers."

  nf_ffi.18.t:0 "The NCR Accepts!"
  nf_ffi.18.d:0 "The NCR has accepted our modest request. Another piece of Mexico is liberated!"
  nf_ffi.18.a:0 "Genial!"

  nf_ffi.19.t:0 "The NCR Declines"
  nf_ffi.19.d:0 "The NCR has declined to transfer the Baja territories to our freedom-loving control. Typical Americans."
  nf_ffi.19.a:0 "Well, it was worth asking."
  nf_ffi.19.b:0 "I hoped they'd say that."

  nf_ffi.20.t:0 "The NCR Has Abandoned Us!"
  nf_ffi.20.d:0 "Despite the promises and treaties made upon our incorporation as an N.C.R. state, we have received news that the Baja is to be transferred to the control of the Free Fighters Federation, a group of masked tribal wrestlers. We have tried and failed to appeal to the N.C.R. to reconsider, but to no avail, we are left with only one option."
  nf_ffi.20.a:0 "Acceptance."
  nf_ffi.20.b:0 "Revolution!"

  nf_ffi.21.t:0 "The Baja Revolts!"
  nf_ffi.21.d:0 "Upon being informed of the treaty made between us and the NCR, the Baja territories have decided they'd rather choose independence than submit to our benevolent rule, this foolishness will be rectified."
  nf_ffi.21.a:0 "We will make them free by force!"

With this in mind we could avoid a bloody head-on conflict by starting an armed uprising behind their lines. Of course, starting a rebellion runs the risk of dealing with the rebels once the whole thing is over, and it may just be simpler to go with the tried and true option."

The continued existence of this man is unacceptable, and it falls upon the Federation to finally put the mad dog down. Even now, the tribes gather to discuss strategy and plan his downfall."

The Bandito was brought before the Blue Demon himself, and proceeded to beg for his life, offering the Blue Demon knowledge of his immense caches of stolen wealth and weapons in exchange for his own life.

The atmosphere in the ring is tense enough to cut through steel, as the three luchadores contending for the title of leader of the Free Fighters face each other. The Blue Demon is first to make a move, searching out a weak point in Mil Mascaras' defenses. The Green Giant is about to retaliate, catching the Demon in a ground slam before El Santo leaps onto his back with a somersault! Fearing a repeat of the first rematch, Mil Mascaras quickly disengages before the Blue Demon reveals his secret weapon, sliding under the ring, he returns to the fray holding a RobCo. Titanium Folding Chair, and begins to wail on Mascaras before El Santo lands a swift blow on them both. This battle is one for the ages folks.
