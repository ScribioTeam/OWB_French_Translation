  ### West Coast ###

  WC_NAME:0 "West Coast"
  WC_DESC:0 "Scorched by nuclear fire, and the flames of wars to follow, the West Coast of America has many stories to tell. This is where the Master formed Unity, where the Enclave announced themselves to the world, and where the NCR was born. It is a crucible of great and terrible powers, and the decisions made by its past inhabitants echo across the wasteland to this day. The influence of the West Coast cannot be overstated, within its lands are numerous powerful nations, such as the scheming city states New Reno and Vault City, the aloof and often righteous Desert Rangers, and the staunch and decaying Brotherhood of Steel. The West is the land of aging titans and rising superpowers.\n\nDespite already overcoming many crises, the West Coast is far from safe. The balance of power is in a state of upheaval as the NCR, bloated and overstretched, struggles to keep the Republic intact and exert its true power. Worse still, the security the Colorado afforded the NCR is a thing of the past: as the East has fallen to a conqueror. Caesar's Legion, a mighty slaver empire ruled by a former Follower that follows Roman doctrine and enforces luddism, continues to empower itself with blood and soil, threatening the status quo with sharpened sticks and machetes. These two powers will inevitably collide, the Bull skewering a sickened Bear upon its horns, and the fragile peace of the last few decades will be burned away once again."
  NCR_OWB_DESC:0 "Despite the staggering losses at the Battle of Navarro, the NCR achieved victory with the aide of the Brotherhood. Decades later tensions with their former allies are running high, and their army has fallen from grace; becoming a mess of undertrained and underequipped soldiers with no standardisation.\n\nThe Bear looks to the east with concern, as reports of Caesar's Legion's rapid growth continue to flood in. To the north the city states grow powerful and the republic debates intervention, while to the south Baja and the Brotherhood continue to be a thorn in the bear's side."
  MOT_OWB_DESC:0 "While the first NCR troopers marched into the Mojave as early as 2253, it was not until the discovery of the Hoover Dam in 2273 that the NCR realised the importance of the desert. The initial occupation progressed smoothly, and in just four months the NCR captured the Hoover Dam. \n\nDespite Chief Hanlon's objections, the Treaty of New Vegas was signed in 2274. For Oliver, the treaty made sense in the face of a resurgent Mojave Brotherhood. The NCR may have been able to seize the Mojave, but the question looms: will they be able to keep it?"
  CES_OWB_DESC:0 "Founded by a group of hostages captured by the Blackfoot Tribe, nobody could have realised how far Caesar would take the tribals under him. Almost two decades later and the Legion is fighting numerous wars of conquest, having absorbed tens of tribes and stripped them of their identities; converting them to Caesar's cult of personality.\n\nThe Legion must consider its options. The White Legs slowly warm to the them, the Hangdogs and Twin Mothers prepare for war, and the NCR observes from a distance. However, Caesar desires the Twisted Hairs as their conquest will bring him closer to Vegas; his Rome."
  BOS_OWB_DESC:0 "Their resounding victory over the Enclave at Navarro gave the Brotherhood much to celebrate, but the following years were punishing. Jeremy Maxson died suddenly, and his successor Jonathan Maxson was killed in action. The next Maxson had been sent east to D.C., and so the Elders were forced to choose one of their own. Mari Törni, a Navarro veteran, was chosen to lead.\n\nBrotherhood operations remain the same: discover tech, steal tech, kill those who disagree. They're expanding their sphere of influence to include the Shi, the Mojave Chapter, and Arroyo. The NCR watches with caution."
  VEG_OWB_DESC:0 "Mr. House founded RobCo before the Great War, and used his wealth to build a machine to sustain his body indefinitely. Awakening late into the new age Mr. House took control over New Vegas, raising the tribes in his casinos up and giving them the gift of civilisation.\n\nMr. House desires to reclaim the platinum chip to activate his Securitrons within the Vault and upgrade their software. Vegas is filled with snakes, and befittingly it has many people who desire to topple the lofty throne of the Lucky 38. Benny, and the King are the main contenders for the top, each with their own motivations."
  EHT_OWB_DESC:0 "Ever since the NCR violently removed the Eighties from Sac-Town they have stalked Utah more vigorously, their hatred for the false republic growing as the years passed. Worshipping the I-80 is deeply rooted into their culture, and they strongly desire to reclaim the road.\n\nWar will soon be upon the Eighties, and their warbikes will roar across the wasteland. There is debate amongst the men as to which glorious conquest to undertake first. Shall they ride to Ruby Valley and finish what they started, reclaim the holy road from Vault City, or sack the decadent casinos of Reno?"
  NCN_OWB_DESC:0 "After the fall of New Jerusalem the mormons were forced to resettle. They founded New Canaan over a period of difficult years, adopting an open and accepting policy for outsiders to avoid repeating the mistakes which ruined their last home.\n\nNew Canaan regularly sends missionaries out to preach the word of God, saying that any man who is baptised may live within their walls as one of their own. They regularly commune with the tribes of Utah, offering the bible, food, and communal help. New Canaan is generally well liked in Utah and treated warmly by most tribes."
  DES_OWB_DESC:0 "Prewar survival tactics proved incredibly effective when employed by proper survivalists. The Desert Rangers strive to protect the innocent from raiders, guarding weaker communities and caravans.\n\nRanger leadership is divided on the direction of their organisation. Some believe that siding with the Brotherhood will serve their goals, others wish to petition the NCR for the protection of Nevada; whilst Snake Vargas is determined to go it alone. All parties agree that their current priorities are to crush the Vipers, and the Jackals, in order to keep the locals safe."
  VLT_OWB_DESC:0 "Surrounded by seemingly endless desert, Vault City is an oasis amongst the suffering wastes. Despite its beautiful appearance, the city is a corrupt pit of ethnocentric elitism and narcissism. Vault City is the most medically advanced faction in the wasteland, capable of cloning limbs and treating injuries that would be untreatable to others - but this knowledge remains sealed behind their walls.\n\nThe former inhabitants of Vault 8 stand at a precipice where they must decide the future of their city state. Whether they continue to spread their name in infamy remains to be seen."
  TRL_OWB_DESC:0 "Within the dark depths of a cave system in Oregon, the denizens of Troll Warren drag screaming victims into a lagoon of FEV. A former dumping ground for Mariposa Military Base, the remote caverns of the Warren are now home to tribal killers.\n\nAs the distant sound of the world ending echoed from outside, a Mariposa guard fell into the glowing lake, and emerged as the First. Old holotapes in a foreign voice remind him of his lost humanity, but they couldn't prevent his mind from slowly deteriorating. Soon the Warren will awaken, and all of Oregon will tremble."
  WBH_OWB_DESC:0 "Eternal winter shrouds the north of America, and within the blizzard a danger watches silently. Seattle is haunted by ghosts, the castoffs of the Midwest, who vengefully stalk the ruins.\n\nElder Immortal lead his few followers to Seattle hoping to found a new chapter - but his violent tactics and the dire situation turned the chapter into a monster. Violence, enslavement, and conscription have all become core tenants of a dark 'Neo Brotherhood' doctrine. The thick snowfall of Seattle is the perfect backdrop for abductions, murder, and the subjugation of the few who remain."
  WHT_OWB_DESC:0 "Roaming the east of Utah, the White Legs travel and consume in order to sustain themselves. Nomadic savages whose ancestors were lucky to survive the apocalypse, the only culture they know is one stained with blood.\n\nSalt-Upon-Wounds is a mighty warrior and the head of the White Legs tribe. He has lead them to many victories, and now he intends to lead them to glory. Rumors of a mighty empire to the south that spans from Arizona to Colorado call the White Legs to a new destiny - a destiny that will see them as the horns of a great brass bull. "
  NEW_OWB_DESC:0 "Reno is known for little more than the stench of sex and jet fumes. Its dubious abodes are packed full of scum, all crowded around games of dice, cards, and women. Alcohol is the blood that runs through the veins of Reno's denizens.\n\nFour families battle for influence within the city and its surroundings. Salvatore, Wright, Bishop, and Mordino - each family has its own goals for the city, but only one can prevail. Outside Reno's territory the Yakuza attempt to expand what little influence they can find, but their days are numbered."
  ARR_OWB_DESC:0 "Arroyo is a nation of unity: tribals and vault dwellers joining to form a civilised society in the north. With the aid of the 'holy' Garden of Eden Creation Kit, New Arroyo has become the most prosperous and beautiful city in the wasteland.\n\nThe Chosen One assumed the role of Elder after saving their people, and in the decades since has devoted their life to cultivating and protecting the precious hope of their people. Arroyo has remained untouched since 2242, but the winds of change rustle the leaves of the forests of New Arroyo."
  HAN_OWB_DESC:0 "Old world cities are frequented by scavengers and vagabonds for their precious salvage, but only the foolish or desperate would seek to plunder Dog-City. The Hangdogs dominate the towering skyscrapers of Dog-City, watching the packs of feral dogs that stalk the streets below - training their own hounds in the art of war.\n\nWith the Legion on a rapid campaign of conquest and integration, the Hangdogs cautiously watch the south as they await the arrival of the Bull. Soon, Bull and Hound will lock horn and jaw in a battle set to define Colorado for years to come."
  WHD_OWB_DESC:0 "Life within the borders of the Hangdogs territory can be difficult, especially if you're \"abnormal\" in some shape or form. Deeply suspicious of outsiders and mutants, the Hangdogs regularly drive ghouls out of their territory, and deny them entry to their settlements.\n\nGhouls go where ghouls are, hoping to find respite from prejudice with their own kind. As such, when a ghoul settlement was established north of the Hangdogs, most ghouls who were ejected from their territory simply moved north. For many, a difficult is life is better than a life of segregation, even if your leader is a 'Withered Dog'."
  HEA_OWB_DESC:0 "Originally a peaceful Christian nation founded by a pastor and his congregation, Heaven's Gate has become an imposing juggernaut of military might and zealous belief in God. Its industry is almost entirely powered by steam cores, miniaturized steam generators small enough to be carried in the palm of your hand.\n\nThe Innocence Lost Massacre changed the way Heaven's Gate looked at outsiders forever. Saint Michael's rise to power only furthered the radicalisation of the clergy, and the cracks are beginning to show. Soon, all outsiders will be sinners in the eyes of the Lord."
  MOJ_OWB_DESC:0 "Founded by Father Elijah, a scribe who miraculously became an Elder within the Brotherhood, the Mojave Chapter was established for an expedition into the Mojave Desert. Despite optimistic early prospects, their results were lacking, which frustrated Elijah greatly.\n\nGrasping at the wasteland from their stronghold in Hidden Valley, the Mojave Chapter prepares to send numerous manned expeditions across the wasteland, at Elijah's frantic request. He dreams of the Old World, and of harnessing the power of the sun. Whether or not his subordinates share his vision remains to be seen."
  BRK_OWB_DESC:0 "§YFor the seasoned wastelander§!. Frigid outcroppings of stone and shattered prewar vessels compliment the twisted nature of the Broken Coast well, its shoreline dotted with miniature tragedies. Life along the coast is hard, and raiding is all the people there know. To them, violence is life itself.\n\nThe ancestors of the current pirates of the Broken Coast endured The Great Blizzard, an event immediately following the Great War, that blocked out the sky and killed untold thousands. Survival is in their blood. When settlers spot raiders from the Broken Coast, they don't fight: they run."
  KHA_OWB_DESC:0 "Made ravenous by the numerous defeats laid at their feet, the Great Khans are desperate to prove their worth to the wasteland at large—and to themselves. With their backs against the wall as the Mojave sizes them up, they must bare their teeth, lest the Khan legacy die out with them.\n\nThe pressure is mounting as old foes rear their heads once more, and the Longhouse splinters as options lessen by the day. In the midst of the uncertainty, Papa Khan, and Regis—his right hand man—lock horns over the future of the gang. Whoever comes out on-top will change the identity of the Great Khans—forever."
  MDT_OWB_DESC:0 "At one point the Marrow Drinkers were but another tribe, feasting on their own and running raids against the Bone Dancers to the east. All that has changed now with the arrival of Mesmeralda. This charismatic Viper has convinced the Marrow Drinkers that she is a queen outright! That she is the character "Mesmeralda" from the Grognak The Barbarian comics! Her "magical relics" and "alchemical treatments" able to bring just about anyone into the same line of thinking that she lives in.\nThe Queen of the Gorgons, with the Marrow Drinkers under her heel hopes to dominate all of Oregon. Will anyone be able to stop her?"
  BDT_OWB_DESC:0 "The Bonedancers are a group of ritualistic raiders heralding from a old PMC tasked with protecting a Future-Tec research facility. Armed with a stash of weapons and a decent supply of G.E.C.K. components ( Even if they didn't really understand how to use them ) they proceeded to dominate eastern Oregon. In recent years they have been falling victim to several foreign influences. From strange cultists to religious pilgrims!\n\nIt is now the year 2275 and it remains to be seen if Cranium can hold the Bonedancers together - or will another take hold of the Bonedancers?"
  MLT_OWB_DESC:0 "N'Gasta! Kvata! Kvakis!\nFrom the western shores of Oregon a dark tribe rules. Their tongues are twisted and minds rotten - they feel that to live in the wastes one must live like a beast, that only primordial and hidden knowledge can bring survival in this cruel world.\nThe Coral Court, a mysterious body rules over the Mirelurk Tribe. They guide them and preach the glory of the great god M'lulu, a monsterous Mirelurk Queen whom the Mirelurk Tribe revere as a god.\nThe kingdom of man will sink below the waves, and the kingdom of M'Lyeh will mantle its crown."
  MUR_OWB_DESC:0 "The Murtaugh Reformers have paid a high price for their salvation. A rag tag bunch of scholars, laypeople, foreign converts and hired mercenaries, The nation is held together by faith and conviction more than any other trait. Firmly believing in the salavation of all people, their doctrinal disagreement lead to a vicious civil war, culiminating in a western exodus across the Snake River.\n\nThis status quo cannot last, and whether it is a path of war or of willing subjugation, Murtaugh will face the difficult path ahead with their heads, and their faith held high."
  ANO_OWB_DESC:0 "To the Lord's Anointed, hell has come to earth. What was a moderately devout religious community before the War emerged from their vault as a fanatic cult, conviced that they alone had retained their souls in the cleansing of the world. This xenophobic isolation would be the eventual catalyist of the Schism between the faithful and the Murtaugh Reformers, who's heretical ways were only spared due to the intervention of High Chapel.\n\nBut time has weakened High Chapel's protections, and the calls for a reunification grow stronger by the day, What faith and reconciliation cannot achieve, the sword must."
  HAM_OWB_DESC:0 "While the squabbling tribes of Utah degenerated into mystic beliefs and fanaticism, The Glass-Makers chose a different path. From the sparkling streets of New Hammond to the firey desert forges, it is the craftsman, not the preacher, who is lifted up.\n\nHowever, all is not at well in New Hammond. New leadership has slowly begun to turn a nation of artisans into fanatics, and while their relationship with the outside world remains amicable, there is no telling what desperation could force the Glass-Makers to do."
  HGH_OWB_DESC:0 "High above their holy river, the High Chapel parishes watch the world flow by. The last force for peace in the region, the rise of Heaven's Gate and the catastrophe of Great Schism have led to a policy of retraction in foreign affairs by the baptisers.\n\nThough peace may reign, there are many who fear that this inaction cannot last, and that when the time has come for the holy to be weighed and measured, they will be found mortally wanting."
  NAV_OWB_DESC: "The Navajo have lived in the southwest for centuries, and survived wave after wave of conquerors. The Spaniards, the Mexicans, and the Americans could not break them. Caesar, to them, is just one more in a line of great powers to adapt to. Although the Navajo are, in theory, subjects of the Legion, the Navajo view their relationship as once of equals. The tribe's councils are divided between those who wish to work with the Legion and the riches it brings, and those who dream of making the Navajo masters of their fate once again."
  ### Mexico ###
  MEX_NAME:0 "Mexico"
  MEX_DESC:0 "A land of preserved and mutated national beauty, Mexico's sweeping vistas are lightly dusted with radiation, thick with bandidos and those who oppose them. Its population lives day to day under a warm sun, cutting through mutated jungles to prospect forgotten cities, leading caravans from the seat of democracy to the halls of an empire. Pre-war cartels who once dominated the entire country continue to operate in the modern day, with drastically fewer clientèle, and an increasingly deadlier selection of drugs and services. American influence can still be felt in territories immediately south of the Rio Grande, where the descendants of American occupiers pass the torch of democracy to their fellow Mexicans.\n\nThe American Army didn't just leave their offspring throughout the north of Mexico. Nestled at the crossroads of their troop and resource networks, a vast military complex whose name has been lost to time stares out at the world with dead eyes. Clicking away deep within its heart, beneath layers of the best automated security America had to offer, Tlaloc resides. Petro-Chico's very own A.I., a military super-computer sold to them by the Americans in return for the rights to occupy Mexico and molest its resources. Tlaloc was charged with ensuring the flow of oil from Mexico to America, keeping facilities and people safe. Almost two hundred years later, it is alone, and falling apart at the seams as its own sub-processes threaten to erase and replace it."
  RRG_OWB_DESC:0 "One of the only pre-war countries to remain after the apocalypse, the Republic of the Rio Grande is a hollow shell of its former self. Surviving the collapse in no small part thanks to the American soldiers within its borders deserting to save civilian lives, the Republic redefined itself in order to survive.\n\nWith the rise of democracy came many challenges, and a long line of presidents have faithfully served the Republic in order to keep its people safe and happy. Despite this, tensions are running high as the Texan Arms Association continues to grow more and more discontent."
  ARM_OWB_DESC:0 "Formed by an insane and powerful splinter of Tlaloc that believes itself to be the reincarnation of Santa Anna, the Army of Mexico is an army with a nation, not a nation with an army. Santa Anna's iron grasp on his population ensures full \"cooperation\" with his forces at all times. \n\nDriven by a desire to redeem himself for the shame of his \"past actions\", the mad AI strives to improve his conscript army and fill out its ranks with robots. Living conditions are poor, working conditions are poorer, and suffering is ignored. Everything is done in service to the reconquest of Mexico: if humans must suffer for that? So be it."
  ATE_OWB_DESC:0 " Originating in the city states of South Mexico, in what was once Morales and Puebla, the Aztlán exploded outwards and grew their borders in a relatively short amount of time. Their greatest weapon was the Priesthood of Xochicalco, a collection of telepathic mutants from whom the imperial dynasty arose. The Aztlán reign supreme from the great city state of Tepic in the west to the shockingly pristine coast of Acapulco Bay in the east. Their bountiful mutant terrain lends itself well to crop cultivation, and they boast one of the largest populations in the Wasteland. But now the Speaker sees a dark future ahead of the Empire, one only she can preserve it from. But will anyone else agree with her?"
  PET_OWB_DESC:0 "Descended from the workers, executives, and civilians who were on-site at the Petro-Chico Corporation's industrial facilities when the Great War began, the current inhabitants of Petro-Chico are a shadow of their ancestors. They squat in the ruins of pre-war refinieres, leaving them to detirorate, eking out a meager existence.\n\nAlthough Tlaloc considers them company employees, the residents of Petro-Chico are isolationist to a fault, and have rejected every attempt the A.I. has ever made to improve the quality of their lives. They fester in their perishing facilities, ignorant of their true worth."
  FFI_OWB_DESC:0 "Surrounded by cartels on all sides, hounded by drug pushers and pimps with mercenary armies, the Free Fighters have maintained their liberty by force. Luchadores of all shapes and sizes create and don unique masks, fighting with brass knuckles and shotgun gauntlets against anyone and everyone. \n\nA pantheon of famous pre-war luchadores forms the core of their identity, enabling them to determine their own qualities through the luchadores they revere at any one given time. They are known to play both face and heel—good guy and bad guy—as it suits them."
  ITZ_OWB_DESC:0 "The Itza originated from a tribe who worshiped the Mayan Gods at Chichen Itza, but the Empire rapidly spread its tendrils through the Yucatan peninsula and the Gulf Coast, establishing themselves as a dominant regional power, until the Atzlan arrived. \n\nThe Atzlan defeated the Itzan forces twice, until Sebastián, then an officer, rallied the Itzan forces at Battle of the Papaloapan River to drive the Atzlans back, and seized power in a coup a few years later. However, the Atzlan still stalk the borders, and new foes are arising - all while the Kalomte is getting older and older..."
  TLA_OWB_DESC:0 "Tlalocan's greatest "person" of interest is her namesake; a pre-war supercomputer named "Tlaloc" after the Aztec god of rain. Tlaloc’s primary motivation is the preservation of humanity, and the business interests it once represented; primarily those of the Petro Chico company. Though it has catered to these diligently for the last 200 years, Tlaloc is plagued with instability; having segmented himself into many alter egos based on notable Mexicans from the past. The repercussions of Tlaloc's Demise, and which of God's children will rise in his place remains to be seen."
  CAF_OWB_DESC:0 "Once merely a bit player on the Mexican stage, Costa Cafeinada has taken the ascendant in the falling shadows of its neighbouring empires. Uninterested in glory or conquest, the Baron's desire for wealth and an economic monopoly is only thinly checked by lip-service obeisance to the Aztlan throne. But the bounds of subserviance will not hold Costa back for long, and everyone who's anyone knows that when it comes to the long con, you don't bet against the ghoul."
  TDT_OWB_DESC:0 "Standing between the titans of Nueva Aztlán and the Itzan Empire, the Mayan peoples of Chiapas have formed their own nation as a fragment of the Itzan Empire. The two split on religious grounds, and a strong separatist sentiment remains widespread, partly inspired by Sajal Tobias Rey II’s decades of success in holding off both Itzan and Aztlan invading forces. Now that Itzan-Aztlan relations are detreating once more, however, it seems the people of Tzotzil may have to pick a side – or else be forced into one…"
  TVR_OWB_DESC:0 "The Viceroyal spun off from Nueva Aztlán when they realized they were within the lands Tlaloc would protect from outside aggression. Why pay taxes to a blind girl if the old world god will protect its cities at no cost?  But as Tlaloc wheezes his final breaths, many wonder how long it will be before the empire comes north to reclaim what it lost."
  SIN_OWB_DESC:0 "Maria has guided her cartel and lands since the Great War, turning a desperate band of raiders in the aftermath of the bombs into a power in its own right. Now that she has come to rule them on her own, she looks forward to a long and profitable reign. Of course, the Republic of the Rio Grande, Caesar, and the Free Fighters may all have something to say about that..."
  GDH_OWB_DESC:0 "The Generalissimo is perhaps the most charismatic man in all of Mexico. Using his good looks, charms, and tactical brilliance, he has united a band of raiders into a professional military force. Others may dabble in the drug trade or protection rackets; the Generalissimo legalizes consumption and establishes a uniform tax system. As he says, why skin the cow when you can milk it? La Gente is one of the most oppressive but best run states in Mexico, and its people firmly believe that the sun upon their flag is not setting on the Pacific, but rising over Mexico. \nAnd did I mention how attractive he is?"
  BLO_OWB_DESC:0 "It is unfair and discriminatory to say that the ghouls of Mexico are heavily involved in the drug trade. Such a claim is grounds for slander in the Republic of the Rio Grande and a trial by combat in the Jaguar cults of the Aztlán.  That being said, some have noticed that the highest ranks of the two strongest cartels in Mexico are dominated by ghouls. If they don't comment on it publicly, it's because the Bloody Baron skinned the last PIel Suave to say that alive."
  GRH_OWB_DESC:0 "No one can quite agree on what lies south of the Honduras and the Darien Gp.  Some say that South America survived the Great WAr largely unscathed, and has chosen neutrality rather than deal with the improverished Wasteland. The people of Honduras claim they are the shield that guards the realm of men (and supermutants, ghouls, and robots) against an unending tide of raiders. Most of Mexico thinks they are lying through their teeth, but what if they aren't?"

  ### Texas ###
  TEX_NAME:0 "Texas"
  TEX_DESC:0 "Ever since the Brotherhood of Steel showed up, Texas has been a downright friendly place. Stop by the brothels of Carbon, catch a roller derby, or listen to Mr. Entertainment's crooning voice. But trouble theatens the respectable folk of Texas. The raiders of Carthage are acting up, and the robots of Santa Anna wade into the Rio Grande. Tensions smoulder along the Rio as the TAA dreams of an capitalist utopia. Rosado dreams of bringing progress and development to all the Wastes. Shale plots to revive the Master's dream.  \n\nAnd lurking on the horizon is Lanius, who comes to bring the word of Caesar to a fallen land. He will not rest until he washes his bloody sword in the Gulf. Who can stand against him? It may be time for the people of Texas to revive their old nation and motto -- 'Come and Take It!'"
  LAC_OWB_DESC:0 "Lanius served Caesar well in the conquests of Arizona, but Caesar has given him a sacred task. Lanius will conquer the East! He shall march against New Mexico, Colorado, and, perhaps, Texas. And when it is over, he shall weep, for there are no more worlds to conquer. \n\nUntil Caesar calls him west, to test the strength of the East against the Wall of the west."
  TAA_OWB_DESC:0 "How do you lead the Texas Arms Association? You don't. It just works! \n\nThe TAA is at a crossroads, threatened by Gloria's increasing tariffs and criticisms of 'arms sales to the Legion'. CEO Todd Howitzer is going to take the Arms Association on the road, and explore some franchise opportunities. \n\nIf the Super Mutants don't eat them first..."
  LNS_OWB_DESC:0 "Once little more than a small town on the I-20, Lone Star bloomed in the hellish aftermath of the Great War as a beacon of trade and hope. Caravans soon began to move up and down the I-20, and Lone Star rapidly expanded its city limits: quickly outstripping the ruins of the pre-war town. \n\nMore than a decade ago, Lone Star suffered a vicious inserection at the hand of the Hand Warband. The ruthless raiders were put down, but splinters of the group are persisted in our border communities. Renewed violence could not come at a worse time for Lone Star..."
  TBH_OWB_DESC:0 "Having been originally foreigners in Texas, did the brotherhood soon feel right at home. Friendships shaped, goals achieved and power consolidated do they now stand at a crossroad. Should they try to uphold their old values, Steel within and without, or should they attempt a new path. A new frontier of restoring what once was before. A Republic the entire world would envy. Regardless which path they take, things will never be as easy as they seem."
  CMC_OWB_DESC: "The Great War has destroyed much, but it didn't destroy people's need for leisure time and entertainment. It also did not destroy greed and jealousy. The Chicasaw-Muscogee-Coalition are a nation steeped in all of these things. Led by Lushanya Harjo, the head of one of the biggest casino families in the nation, they are powder keg of criminal activity waiting to explode.\n\nAll the while strange things are happening to the west threatening not only them, but everyone in the region."
  CHO_OWB_DESC: "The Choctaw have kept the tradition of the storyteller alive through many hardships before the Great War and they have not stopped yet. Nashoba Solomon has many stories to tell himself, but nowadays he is happiest seeing his home prosper. And an opportunity opened itself up that would have not been possible before the war. Ghouls, in many regions feared or despised, can offer their stories collected over their long, long lives to the current generation. Helping to guide them and to not repeat what lead to the world they live in."
  CHR_OWB_DESC: "While certain groups in the wasteland fear technology for what it did to the world, the Cherokee have embraced it, even long before the Great War. It is what kept them and the other groups that now form the Great Plains Federation alive during it. Without their foresight and technological prowess neither the shining lights of the Coalitions casinos or the Choctaws lofty ambitions to build a library to survive the ages would be a thing now. And what are a few ethical...missteps in the face of these accomplishments.\n §RAttention: While playable, their unique content is rather short and will be expanded upon once the map expands.§!"
  TBH_OWB_DESC: "Descended from the heroes who came east to fight Attis' super-mutant army, the Texan Brotherhood are the rough riders who the other Brotherhoods do not invite to dinner.  Standing up for truth, justice, and the Texan way, they have kept their new home safe for decades. But new threats, from the west and south, menace Texas. There are those within the Brotherhood who think the Chapter has fallen too far from its original role, and prepare to make their new stand at the Alamo. But Elder Rusk's trusty shotgun will make short work of any who threaten Yellow Glow of Texas!"
  TTM_OWB_DESC: "The tribes of the Wasteland whisper of a goddess who blesses their crops; The more civilized folk tell tales of a presence within the fabled halls of the Nursery, guiding a swarm of robots across Colorado for the 'Betterment of Mankind'. The truth is a little more complicated than either story! Diana Stone, perhaps the greatest scientist to survive the Great War, lives to this day as the leader of a peaceful tribe in Colorado. But change is coming, and the Wasteland cries out for mercy and kindness. Perhaps it is time for her to emerge from her machines and save the world."
  SHA_OWB_DESC: "While other mutants of Texas abandoned the vision and dream of Attis, Shale keeps it alive. The humans of Texas fear the vats of FEV, as Fort Stockton prepares for war.  If Shale succeeds, the emerald banner will fly across Texas and the mutant race will stand supreme once more. \n\nEspecially with the help of this new Shop-Tec terminal . . . "
  UOA_OWB_DESC: "While Shale and the Ironmongers threaten the good people of Texas, Keats has a dream of peace. One cannot, after all, hug one's children with nuclear arms. Let the super-mutants spread a message of love to the weak, puny humans; let them understand that mutants see humans as friends, not food; and let them go forward together. Shale will work with the rest of the Texas to build a better world where all men are created equal. Even if some of the men are created using FEV."
  ORO_OWB_DESC: "There is a lonesome road to Hell, paved with good intentions.  Some say Hecate walks that road. Hecate's tribe was destroyed by Caesar, but she was saved by the kindness of Diana. Hecate used Diana's wisdom, however, to become a prophet. Now her daughters and hounds have gathered strength and plot to take down Caesar. \n\nHecate's rule is challenged, however, by her hounds. Some of them would rather conquer Colorado than seize Flagstaff. Time will tell if Hecate will prevail, or if she will fail yet again."
  IMO_OWB_DESC: "Shale dreams of a new mutant empire. Keats prays for a better world. The Juggernaut knows the things that really matter - RED STRIPES MAKE THINGS GO FASTER. \n\nThe Ironmongers are plotting to go south, and loot the richest of Mexico. For even robot gods are made of tasty, tasty scrap."
  TUB_OWB_DESC: "Mr. Entertainment's broadcasts bring joy to the Wasteland, and his followers work to bring a little bit of joy to everyone. While some cynics point out that only recently could Texas support anything like a television industry, rendering this a cute gimmick, others are happy to gather in their taverns, bars, or town halls to watch the latest broadcast."

People struggled to survive and over the decades the survivors banded into larger and larger groups.\n\nSettlers continue on in an attempt to retain the morals of the old world. Tribals stalk the lands of their ancestors, hunting and avoiding the technology left behind by the old world. Raiders continue to dominate the wasteland, killing, pillaging, and burning. Resources are scarce and the numerous communities of the wasteland are always struggling to survive."
