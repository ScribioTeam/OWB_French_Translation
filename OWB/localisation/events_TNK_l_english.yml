  nf_tnk.4.t:0 "Continuing the x-8 Research Program"
  nf_tnk.4.d:0 "The x-8 Research Facility was always Borous's favourite. A small testing ground where he could conduct experiments on the subversive nature of Communism, gene-splice bad students and live out his dream of being "Doctor-Principal".\nHowever, few test subjects remain in order to keep this facility operational! Borous hopes to gather a new, more interesting testing pool for his new x-8 experiments."
  nf_tnk.4.a:0 "Its merely SCIENCE, Lobotomite! Don't you understand?"

  nf_tnk.5.t:0 "Lights in the Sky"
  nf_tnk.5.d:0 "Strange lights have appeared in the sky, coming from the south and heading towards Zion! People who have come outside to look to them tend to vanish into brilliant clouds of smoke, their brilliance turning them to vapour!\nThe lights would last a few days before passing and heading back towards the Mojave..."
  nf_tnk.5.a:0 "Where did they go?"

  nf_tnk.51.t:0 "Some Lost Students Collected!"
  nf_tnk.51.d:0 "We have managed to recover some of the descendants of a group of lost students who tried running from x-8 all the way to Zion."
  nf_tnk.51.a:0 "No student gets out of school EARLY!"

  nf_tnk.6.t:0 "Future-Tec's Greatest Work"
  nf_tnk.6.d:0 "Out east, there exists a particular experiment that Borous had some envy over.\nIt was the research of Future-Tec, and their "Hibernation Pods". It takes 'so long' to set up a physical school like you would with x-8. By augmenting a limited physical construction effort with partial mind control through the use of Tranquillity Lane era system protocols we could vastly increase the acceptance rate of our program."
  nf_tnk.6.a:0 "I wish he could have worked with us here, if he wasn't so WEIRD."

  nf_tnk.7.t:0 "The Tranquillity Lane Schooling Board"
  nf_tnk.7.d:0 "Across the NCR we have begun to set up "Tranquillity Lane" schools. Essentially a mix of VR brain control and partial physical construction. We don't want to take 'all of their time away' - that would lead to our new testing populace dying off too early.. No, we simply want to take a few hours away from them a day. By limiting the impact of our research we can relatively quickly gather quite a bit of research data!"
  nf_tnk.7.a:0 "Give me the DATA!"

  remove_tranquility_lane_high_schools:0 "Try to Remove Tranquillity Lane High Schools"
  remove_tranquility_lane_high_schools_desc:0 "If we ever want to remove the Tranquillity Lane High Schools we will need to get rid of this strange pacification effect we feel when we try to. In order to do so we will need to deal with the source of this mess in the Mojave."

  nf_tnk.10.t:0 "A Miracle of Science"
  nf_tnk.10.d:0 "It seems that the fact that 8 and 0 were both experimenting in the Sierra Madre without either being aware of what the other was doing has led to something unexpected happening to the holograms living there.\n\nWhile before, the holograms acted more as ‘recordings’ - taking a snippet of conversation and basing their entire personalities on that now they have begun a process of rapid intelligence growth, becoming some sort of general artificial intelligence even better then the sorts RobCo was capable of before the great war! These new holograms are capable of understanding that it was BigMT research that led to their creation, seeming thankful for what we have done to them."
  nf_tnk.10.a:0 "The best science is done by accident."

  #11 and 12 were cut for now. Might try reworking them later? Just not confident enough to write them.

  nf_tnk.13.t:0 "Thank You from the Sierra Madre"
  nf_tnk.13.d:0 "Even if we did not intend it the Ghosts of the Sierra Madre seem to be thankful - at least in their own way- for our assistance..\n\nYet, they don’t want anything more to do with us.\n\nThey seem to have a level of recognition where they can tell that if we were to further tamper with them it would only put their currently existing intelligence at risk. We have not only been ‘asked’ to avoid coming back to the Sierra Madre but they have even set up defences to try to prevent us from coming back!\n\nOne particular of these AI’s - one based on an old pre-war signer - has, out of a sense of gratitude for allowing her to move past her old life, made efforts to give us a reward for what we have done.\nFor Doctor 8, she has given him a signed album for a previously unreleased single of hers.\nFor Doctor 0, she has given some of the industrial secrets National Electric kept within the deep storage of the Sierra Madre’s computers, ancient technological blueprints of our old rival that could prove instrumental in continuing the pursuit of science.."
  nf_tnk.13.a:0 "We will still be watching you!... Just from a distance."

  nf_tnk.14.t:0 "Studying the East"
  nf_tnk.14.d:0 "To the east lies a curious little group.\nThey pretend to play as Romans, wearing costumes and having such fun little dances they perform with the other teddies.\nYet, when they hit each other the teddies go still, growing pale and still as they fall into the ground."
  nf_tnk.14.a:0 "Maybe I can help the still teddies dance."

  nf_tnk.15.t:0 "Helping Them Move"
  nf_tnk.15.d:0 "The still teddies, no matter how much I prod at them don’t seem able to move on their own. They need the help of the Trauma Harness!\nBy plugging them in we can ensure that their little dance never stops."
  nf_tnk.15.a:0 "I am a good person."

  nf_tnk.16.t:0 "The Motions"
  nf_tnk.16.d:0 "The dance of the easterners is a curious one. Periods of rest and sleep, periods of motion followed by periods of dance. By learning the pattern in their motions I can better ensure its efficiency!"
  nf_tnk.16.a:0 "For science, of course."

  nf_tnk.17.t:0 "Lights in the Sky"
  nf_tnk.17.d:0 "It seems that manually attaching Trauma Harnesses will be far too slow. Instead I should use a rather creative little plan - using the moon as a “reflective dish” in order to transmit a continuous teleportation signal to sites within the easterners lands where they have stored quite a bit of fallen teddies. We can dynamically and continuously send Trauma Harnesses onto their little teddy bear bodies, ensuring that their lovely dance never ends."
  nf_tnk.17.a:0 "Lets see what happens.."

  nf_tnk.18.t:0 "Something Beautiful"
  nf_tnk.18.d:0 "When I started the program I was amazed with the turnout! Thousands of teddies rising from their dirt-homes to once again continue that fascinating little dance they lived in life. I will need to guide these poor little teddies from afar - ensure that nobody interrupts my experiment here."
  nf_tnk.18.a:0 "I love my little teddy bears."

  nf_tnk.19.t:0 "The Dead Speak!"
  nf_tnk.19.d:0 "Rumours stir that the Legion’s atrocities have unleashed something foul on the wasteland. The dead are rising! Led by the self proclaimed “Rex Astrorum” the dead Legionnaires are crawling out of their graves with the aid of strange space-age suits. These wandering dead think they are “Real Romans”, worshipping the moon itself as their deity of choice!"

  nf_tnk.20.t:0 "Weird Science on the Horizon"
  nf_tnk.20.d.1:0 "Ever since those strange scientists took over the Mojave we have had the sensation that we were being watched, strange dancing lights able to be seen in the sky at night."
  nf_tnk.20.1:0 "It's just a superstition."
  nf_tnk.20.d.2:0 "The moon has started to look a little different near the Mojave. It seems we are being watched a little more closely now."
  nf_tnk.20.2:0 "They are up to something, we should probably stop them."
  nf_tnk.20.d.3:0 "There are rumours that there have been some strange sightings around the grave sights near the Mojave, the moon has never quite been as bright as it is now."
  nf_tnk.20.3:0 "We need to stop them!"
