Can we please bring some specimens to the lab? It gets so dreary here with just you five.§!\n§RBorous: I very much agree, we can run EXPERIMENTS on them... As long as we do not give them GUNS.\n§!§MKlein: NO. NO LOBOTOMITES IN THE LABORATORY, WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME WITH THE SCREWDRIVER - NEVER AGAIN.§!"

 tnk_lobotomite_conscription_desc: "The human, mutant and ghoul population living under the Think Tank is left mostly out of the loop of the Think Tank's machinations. Lobotomites - humans with their brains removed and turned into little more then animals - make up a majority of the human workers serving the Think Tank.\n§GMobius: These lobotomites are growing exceedingly inefficient, eventually we need to end this experiment and replace each of them with Robo-scorpions.§!\n§pDala: I don't know, I find their silly brainless-bodies fascinating.§!\n§MKlein: WHAT IS IT?

 tnk_scientific_industry: "Industry of Science"
 tnk_scientific_industry_desc: "The Think Tank has an extremely easy time building and constructing things then other wastelanders - matter reassembly, weird science and a practically infinite lobotomite workforce make construction of science materia absolutely painless.\n§GDoctor Mobius: I appreciate you all letting me handle this Klein - despite the animosity we shared in the past.§!\n§MKlein: WELL, I DIDN'T WANT TO MANAGE THAT ANYWAY - YOU ARE THE ONE THAT HAS YOUR ROBO-WHATEVERS CONSTANTLY PATROLLING ABOUT. I NEED TO FOCUS ON SCIENCE! YOU CAN FOCUS ON THAT -... OTHER STUFF.§!"

 tnk_simple_commands: "Simple Commands"
 tnk_simple_commands_desc: "The Think Tank primairly uses a completely untrained force, preferring simple commands such as "Smash", "Destroy" and "Pulverise" to call their Lobotomites and Robo-scorpions into action..\n§ODoctor 0: If we are going to be having these Lobotomites go after these play-time nations we really should be giving them better directions. They keep on walking into walls - like a broken RobCo unit with a pathfinding bug.§!\n§MDoctor Klein: WE HAVE BETTER THINGS TO BE DOING THEN CONCERNING OURSELVES WITH LOBOTOMITES. JUST LET THE LOBOTOMITES KILL THE OTHER LOBOTOMITES AND WE WONT HAVE TO DEAL WITH ANY OF THEM.§!"
 tnk_old_world_blues: "§MOLD WORLD BLUES§!"
 tnk_old_world_blues_desc: "There is an expression in the Wasteland:\n"Old World Blues."\n\nIt refers to those so obsessed with the past they can't see the present, much less the future, for what it is.\nThey stare into the what-was, eyes like pilot lights, guttering and spent, as the realities of their world continue on around them.\nScience is a long, steady progression into the future. What may seem a sudden event often isn't felt for years, even centuries, to come.\n\nIn the times following the First Battle of the Hoover Dam, however, Old World Blues took on a new meaning.\nWhere once it was viewed as a form of sadness, nostalgia, it became an expression describing the potential for the future.\nIt can be easy to see Science as evil, technology unchecked as the source of all ills, all misfortunes.\nWith the Think Tank united under a common cause for the first time in over two hundred years science would become a beacon for the future. There was Old World Blues, and New World Hope. And hope ruled the day at Big MT. "

 tnk_tranquility_lane_high_schools_desc: "Our country has become afflicted by a strange new fad that we seem unable to remove! The "Tranquility Lane High Schools" have begun springing up around our lands. Every time we have tried to destroy one of these establishments our soldiers have felt a sense of -.. disinterest, something else catching their attention that is seemingly of more importance.\nThese schools are mostly harmless and are leading to our people becoming more educated, but over time they will drain more and more of our peoples interest as children and teachers get continually recruited from our populace through unknown means."
