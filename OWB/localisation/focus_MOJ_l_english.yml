  MOJ_our_founding: "Our Founding"
  MOJ_our_founding_desc: "While High Elder Maxson was the founder of the Brotherhood as a whole, each chapter has had its own founders, those that spread the word of the dangers of technology farther into the Wasteland. Who were our founders?"

  MOJ_our_interim: "Our Interim"
  MOJ_our_interim_desc: "Each chapter of the Brotherhood has its own priorities. Some focus on collecting the powerful weapons of the Old World, while some prioritise the industrial machinery and tools. What did we focus on?"

  MOJ_our_future: "Our Future"
  MOJ_our_future_desc: "We have learned plenty in the years that are now behind us. We must now use that experience and make preparations for the many years that are in front of us."

  MOJ_water_operations: "Water Operations"
  MOJ_water_operations_desc: "With secure access to a large body of water, we can begin to expand our operations to a naval theatre. Although we have little to no experience in such matters, we can look to pre-war tactics for guidance."

  MOJ_port_expansion: "Port Expansion"
  MOJ_port_expansion_desc: "In order to host a fleet of operational size we require numerous facilities, such as dry docks, maintenance yards, piers, etc. In order to accomplish our goals we'll need to invest heavily in the expansion of our existing naval infrastructure."

  MOJ_supporting_vessels: "Sea Raiders"
  MOJ_supporting_vessels_desc: "Smaller and lighter craft make up the bulk of modern wasteland navies. To keep our edge in the seas we must invest in the production of simple, robust crafts, who can harass enemy vessels with ease."

  MOJ_larger_vessels: "Siege Ships"
  MOJ_larger_vessels_desc: "In order to make any kind of dent in an enemy navy, and to effectively support our troops on the shore, we need to be capable of building large ships capable of mounting large weaponry. Focusing on this will bring us closer to naval domination."

  MOJ_reclaim_a_flagship: "Reclaim a Flagship"
  MOJ_reclaim_a_flagship_desc: "Power projection is everything. In order to truly make our mark on the seas we cannot simply have an effective navy: we must also have an impressive one. A refitted flagship of the old world would suit our needs nicely."

  MOJ_aerial_operations: "Aerial Operations"
  MOJ_aerial_operations_desc: "Flexibility is something our organisation often lacks. In order to account for our weaknesses we must turn them into strengths. In the past, vast expeditions have been undertaken with the aid of aerial equipment. We can learn from this."

  MOJ_from_the_skies: "From The Skies"
  MOJ_from_the_skies_desc: "Although we possess the knowledge to retrofit the most basic of aircraft, we have no knowledge on how to pilot them in combat, or how to utilise them tactically. We should turn to our databases and adapt as much information on pre-war air tactics as we can."

  MOJ_staging_bases: "Staging Bases"
  MOJ_staging_bases_desc: "Aircraft are oversized paperweights without the proper facilities to maintain and arm them, and enough open space to take off and land. If we want to develop an effective air force we need to scout for ideal locations to create airfields, and do just that."

  MOJ_aerial_supremacy: "Aerial Supremacy"
  MOJ_aerial_supremacy_desc: "With our newfound understanding of ariel combat, we can begin to redesign our planes with the wasteland in mind. Cutting corners where possible will save us a lot of production time and valuable resources, both of which are things in scarce supply currently."

  MOJ_flight_academy: "Brotherhood Flight Academy"
  MOJ_flight_academy_desc: "Pilots are the lifeblood of an air force, and our pilots need to make effective use of our limited supply of planes, ammunition, and equipment. Establishing a thorough training programme for pilots will not only make better use of our equipment, but it may provide us with a genuine ace."

  MOJ_our_right: "Our Right"
  MOJ_our_right_desc: "As a technocratic organisation, every piece of tech is rightfully ours. We do not steal technology out of malice or spite, we take it away to protect the innocents who will inevitably misuse it. Although people don't always understand, everything we do is ultimately to keep the wasteland safe. Our understanding of technology is second to none."

  MOJ_salvaged_metal: "Salvaged Metal"
  MOJ_salvaged_metal_desc: "Metal salvage is easy to come by. Twisted scraps of metal are as common as dirt in the wasteland, protruding from buildings, buried in the earth like weeds, and strewn across streets like rubbish. Salvaging the metal in our immediate area will provide us with more resources for our equipment."

  MOJ_increase_power_production: "Increase Power Production"
  MOJ_increase_power_production_desc: "Generators are both a blessing and a curse. They create large amounts of power for relatively low maintenance cost, but they often require specific fuel cells and are difficult to redesign to run off of corn fuel. Investing in power generation will always benefit our equipment output."

  MOJ_salvaged_electronics: "Salvaged Electronics"
  MOJ_salvaged_electronics_desc: "Salvaging electronics is much more difficult than salvaging metal, in part due to the delicate nature of most electronics. At best, pulling the wiring and circuitry from radios, robots, and broken energy weapons will provide us with more scrap electronics for future projects."

  MOJ_advanced_tech: "Advanced Tech"
  MOJ_advanced_tech_desc: "Gathering rare technology is not only difficult, but dangerous. Often, the locations where rare pre-war technology can be found are also filled with killer robots, deadly radiation, or other hazards. Still, gathering advanced tech will allow us to create numerous high-end pieces of equipment, so it must be done."

  MOJ_fueling_our_rise: "Fueling Our Rise"
  MOJ_fueling_our_rise_desc: "Fuel comes in all forms, but often our scavenging parties search for the nuclear variety. Unspent fuel cells are incredibly valuable to everyone in the wasteland, but especially to us. They power our power armour, our gatling lasers, and our generators. Securing them is a high priority for all scouts."

  MOJ_arm_foundries: "Arms Foundries"
  MOJ_arm_foundries_desc: "We cannot spread and uphold our doctrine without force, and we cannot apply force effectively if our men are undersupplied. If the Brotherhood is to continue its operations, we must not only take technology from the hands of settlers, but produce it ourselves."

  MOJ_civilian_workshops: "Civilian Workshops"
  MOJ_civilian_workshops_desc: "Many of the bunkers and bases we seek to occupy were not left untouched by the Great War, and they require extensive repairs and excavation efforts to become fully usable. To ensure that we're prepared for future construction efforts, we should begin to develop a small industrial base of our own."

  MOJ_heavy_production: "Heavy Production"
  MOJ_heavy_production_desc: "With our civilian and military industry projects finished we're seeing our efforts pay off hand over fist. In order to continue to foster success and fuel our growth, we should launch a second, smaller construction effort, focusing on a mixture of both branches. Alongside this, we can set up infrastructure for future efforts, also."

  MOJ_our_might: "Our Might"
  MOJ_our_might_desc: "The Brotherhood of Steel is feared and respected throughout the wasteland for our military might. In terms of combat effectiveness, we are high above the dregs the wasteland has to offer. One man in power armour is worth ten unarmoured soldiers, if not more. Studying previous engagements will help us improve our future combat doctrine."

  MOJ_steel_legions: "Steel Legions"
  MOJ_steel_legions_desc: "Standing side by side our men form a wall of unbreakable strength. The Brotherhood is like one long chain, spread out across the continent, with many, many links throughout its length. No part of the Brotherhood is weak, every man and woman is trained to a level of proficiency other groups can only dream of."

  MOJ_new_initiates: "New Initiates"
  MOJ_new_initiates_desc: "We're more than just a military organisation, the Brotherhood is one large family. Our knights, paladins, and scribes are all free to pursue relationships, marry, and have children. This is how the Brotherhood survives. When these children come of age, they become initiates, and start their training for their respective discipline."

  MOJ_t45d_production: "T-45d Production"
  MOJ_t45d_production_desc: "T-45d was the first model of power armour produced by America, and it shows. A simple frame, lacklustre servos, exposed weak points and a less than impressive helmet design. Still, any power armour is better than none, and its simplicity makes it faster to fix and produce."

  MOJ_t51b_production: "T-51b Production"
  MOJ_t51b_production_desc: "The pinnacle of pre-war power armour design, the T-51b model is a favourite among the Brotherhood of Steel for its robust design, shaped ceramic armour, lack of clear weak points, and expertly crafted helmet and filters. Although harder to maintain and produce, there's no doubt that T-51b is superior to T-45d in every way."

  MOJ_wastelander_conscripts: "Wastelander Conscripts"
  MOJ_wastelander_conscripts_desc: "Wastelanders are a dime a dozen, with little special or unique about them. Often short sighted, brutish, and too simple to understand the danger of technology: we often avoid them like the plague. Still, sometimes, new blood is required. At times like these, we hunt the population for worthy candidates, often accepting proven and friendly wastelanders into our ranks."

  MOJ_flesh_before_steel: "Flesh Before Steel"
  MOJ_flesh_before_steel_desc: "\"The flesh is weak,\" a common phrase with a vastly different meaning to others than to us. In the Brotherhood, this phrase is said to express and accept that the human body is frail. Even with our power armour we are still human, and unless the body inside the armour has been trained properly, it will die off long before the armour breaks. All initiates are trained to understand this: weakness is human."

  MOJ_basic_arms_for_basic_people: "Basic Arms for Basic People"
  MOJ_basic_arms_for_basic_people_desc: "Even wastelanders recruited into our ranks cannot be expected to understand technology as well as we do. In order to prevent any unfortunate accidents, we provide wasteland recruits with simpler energy weapons until they've proven themselves capable. Naturally, this means we produce and salvage many weapons ahead of time for new recruits."

  MOJ_doctrinal_thought: "Doctrinal Thought"
  MOJ_doctrinal_thought_desc: "With new blood comes new ideas. Wastelanders think and fight a different way to the Brotherhood, and this experience often proves valuable for the Brotherhood as a whole. By making our wasteland initiates compose reports of their previous battles, we can examine them to gauge the state of the wasteland, and prepare accordingly."

  MOJ_combined_operations: "Combined Operations"
  MOJ_combined_operations_desc: "Learning to fight alongside former wastelanders can be difficult. Their wild, survivalist minded style of combat can often be hectic and unpredictable. This is precisely why recruiting them can be so valuable, and why fitting them into our command structure is so beneficial. That wild, unpredictable nature only makes our squads more effective than before."

  MOJ_our_goal: "Our Goal"
  MOJ_our_goal_desc: "The Brotherhood's ideology is straight forward. We desire a world in which the recklessness of man cannot be enabled by the tools he wields, a world in which atrocities aren't committed for the sake of \"scientific progress.\" This is why we confiscate technology, and destroy that which we cannot confiscate. All of our duties are for the good of mankind as a whole."

  MOJ_seek_technology: "Technological Study"
  MOJ_seek_technology_desc: "Replicating the electronics of the pre-war is a difficult task, even for the simplest of designs. If we want to have any hope of reliably recreating somewhat advanced designs, we need to dissect our precious few working pre-war models and examine their inner workings. It's painful, but unless we can figure out the secret behind these things, we'll forever be in the dark."

  MOJ_scribe_research: "Scribe Research"
  MOJ_scribe_research_desc: "Pushing our scribes towards longer research projects will inevitably reward us. Prioritising long term study and self reflection should make our results more accurate, and having scribes accompany scouting squads should make them much more capable of investigating pre-war sites. Scribes are the backbone of the Brotherhood, we must continue to hone their skills."

  MOJ_old_developments: "Old Developments"
  MOJ_old_developments_desc: "Pre-war technology is inherently valuable, even if it's broken and only pure scrap. Scouring pre-war ruins for undiscovered rare technology, whether broken or somewhat working, is an important part of the Brotherhood's operations in the wasteland."

  MOJ_robotic_advancements: "Robotic Advancements"
  MOJ_robotic_advancements_desc: "Robotics was one of America's largest industries before the Great War, and it was considered a world leader in the field of robotics. As a result of this the wasteland is scattered with the shells of broken robots, as well as the roaming figures of those still following outdated programming. Taking both apart will aid us in building robots for our own ends."

  MOJ_vertibird_schematics: "Vertibird Schematics"
  MOJ_vertibird_schematics_desc: "The most prized of all pre-war schematics, the schematics for Vertibirds are rare and difficult to come across. All known copies have only ever come from the Enclave, and with their demise this precious supply has dried up. Still, former Enclave technicians who escaped their demise often take many tools with them... and sometimes, a schematic or two."

  MOJ_bunker_thought: "Bunker Mindset"
  MOJ_bunker_thought_desc: "Almost all members of the Brotherhood were born in a bunker, and most of us spent our lives growing up in and around them. For us, the safety of a bunker is reassuring and comforting. As a result, Brotherhood fortifications are built to a higher standard than most others, due to our familiarity with reinforced structures."

  MOJ_surface_outposts: "Surface Outposts"
  MOJ_surface_outposts_desc: "In order to expand our operations farther and farther, we require secure facilities to store supplies and rest between expeditions. Establishing a construction corps specifically for the purpose of building surface fortifications would benefit us greatly."

  MOJ_underground_workshops: "Underground Workshops"
  MOJ_underground_workshops_desc: "Expanding our industrial base inside of our bunker network is our next priority. Setting up industry within fortified positions will allow us to continue to create a respectable output even while on the back foot, effectively creating a layer of industry that our enemy cannot take until the very end."

  MOJ_new_technology: "Technological Breakthrough"
  MOJ_new_technology_desc: "Our scribes have made a series of significant scientific discoveries in rapid succession, broadening our horizons and impacting all of our current research projects from the ground up. This is truly incredible, as these teachings will allow us to pursue our research and restoration projects faster than ever before."

  MOJ_tesla_theory: "Tesla Theory"
  MOJ_tesla_theory_desc: "With our new breakthroughs in the field of science, our scribes have been able to recreate a pre-war schematic we found long ago. Formerly, we were incapable of reproducing its effects without disastrous results. Now, however, we've finally managed to stabilise the design enough for combat use. Tesla weaponry has been added to our armouries!"

 # Mojave Chapter #

  MOJ_chapter_leadership: "Chapter Leadership"
  MOJ_chapter_leadership_desc: "Within the innermost part of Hidden Valley, a great debate is taking place between Elijah and McNamara over the future of the Mojave Chapter itself. The core of the debate is centred around Elijah's obsession with the Old World, and how it negatively impacts the chapter. The outcome of the debate remains uncertain."

  MOJ_elijah: "Elijah"
  MOJ_elijah_desc: "After the debate, Elijah managed to retain control of his chapter, even with tensions still high. However, seeing his determination to follow his ambitions has created as much awe as ire, and his position remains absolute. Elijah is the undisputed leader of the Mojave Chapter."

  MOJ_scribal_thought: "Scribal Thought"
  MOJ_scribal_thought_desc: "Elijah, unlike all other elders, is a scribe: not a paladin. His background has had an effect on his style of leadership, which puts greater emphasis on research and the study of pre-war technology. Although many in the Brotherhood have doubted his approach, none can deny that he obtains results other Elders simply cannot."

  MOJ_old_world_rumors: "Rumours of the Old World"
  MOJ_old_world_rumors_desc: "Elijah has heard many stories about the mysterious Sierra Madre, and he spends the beginning of every expedition staring at the ominous figure of Helios One in the distance. Both of these places have dark secrets waiting to be uncovered, their roots dig deep into old world conspiracy. Elijah believes he has the key to unlocking those secrets."

  MOJ_helios_one: "Retaking Helios One"
  MOJ_helios_one_desc: "The NCR has robbed us of Helios One, a key part of Elijah's greater ambitions. Its energy output is essential to the future of the chapter itself, and Elijah insists that there's more to the facility than meets the eye. Whether or not his delusions will prove true, the fact remains that we cannot allow the NCR to control such advanced and dangerous technology."

  MOJ_energy_boom: "Energy Boom"
  MOJ_energy_boom_desc: "Helios One is a miracle of pre-war science, highly advanced even for its day, and completely irreplaceable in the modern wasteland. Elijah, however, is undaunted by these issues facing him. His mind works in mysterious ways, and he's assured us that he will be able to repair the facility, given time. Considering the output has recently increased, he might just be worth believing."

  MOJ_sierra_madre: "Sierra Madre"
  MOJ_sierra_madre_desc: "An invitation left unanswered for 200 years calls the wasteland to a grand opening unlike any other, where friends and freedom await. You can begin again, the sultry voice promises, and who doesn't want that? Many a desperate fool has followed that forgotten voice, and now, the Brotherhood is going to do the same."

  MOJ_a_forgotten_hellscape: "A Forgotten Hellscape"
  MOJ_a_forgotten_hellscape_desc: "The air smells like old world gold, rust, and blood. The Sierra Madre has all of these in spades, indeed, its streets are lined with gold, choked by rust, and slick with blood. The rumours were all true, this is paradise on earth: but a nuclear holocaust, 200 years of neglect, a parasitic cloud that devours men in their armour, and mysterious ghost people have turned it into a forgotten hellscape."

  MOJ_what_remains: "What Remains"
  MOJ_what_remains_desc: "Death incarnate: that is the Sierra Madre's true form. In a place filled with nothing but death and despair, little remains, but those few dregs are like liquid starlight. Unkillable men who stalk the heart of the casino and vending machines capable of making something from almost nothing: these are the gifts left to us by the ghosts of the Sierra Madre."

  MOJ_a_forgotten_weapon: "A Forgotten Weapon"
  MOJ_a_forgotten_weapon_desc: "Elijah's promises have come true. Even after his genius brought Helios One back to a quarter of its total output, we were skeptical of his claims. Today, however, we were proven deeply wrong in our estimation of his promise. White light that splits the sky with a scream, leaving nothing but charred remains in its wake: this is the weapon Elijah has delivered to us."

  MOJ_hardin: "Hardin"
  MOJ_hardin_desc: "Hardin has emerged the victor of the debate, although he wielded a weapon instead of words. Standing tall over Elijah's still warm ashes in the gloom of that bunker, McNamara simply stood aside and let Hardin have his way. For better or worse, this West Coast loyalist now leads the Mojave Chapter."

  MOJ_paladin_thought: "Paladin Thought"
  MOJ_paladin_thought_desc: "Hardin is a true believer in the doctrine put forward by the Western Brotherhood, having been somewhat loathe to leave the heart of the Brotherhood behind. With his newfound power as the Elder of the Mojave Chapter, Hardin will focus on what he knows best: combat."

  MOJ_know_our_name: "Know Our Name"
  MOJ_know_our_name_desc: "For too long the Brotherhood has been considered weak by the population of the Mojave. They do not talk of us in hushed tones anymore, rather, they speak openly about how free of our influence they are. They call us \"tin cans\" and joke about our doctrine of tech reclamation. No longer! Soon, the day of reckoning will come for the Mojave, and they will know our name."

  MOJ_technology_raids: "Technology Raids"
  MOJ_technology_raids_desc: "Technology cannot remain in the hands of wastelanders any longer. Everything that could be a threat should be considered a threat. It's not enough to follow up sightings of technology in the wasteland, rather it's time to proactively search for it. Kick down every door, pull open every closet. We won't stop looking until the house is empty, or until the occupants are dead: or both."

  MOJ_closedown_van_graffs: "Close Down Van Graffs"
  MOJ_closedown_van_graffs_desc: "The Van Graff family is well known throughout California, their name is often whispered in seedy bars and back alleys. Their influence throughout Redding and North California is immense, but it wanes the farther away you go. It's time to teach the Van Graffs a stern lesson: selling pre-war tech in Brotherhood territory drastically shortens your lifespan."

  MOJ_gun_runner_caravan_raids: "Gun Runners Caravan Raids"
  MOJ_gun_runner_caravan_raids_desc: "The Gun Runners are one of the only organisations in the post-war that can be considered master craftsmen. Working off of tightly guarded pre-war gun schematics, the Gun Runners produce and sell top of the line weapons for a high price. Their operations in the Mojave aren't nearly as well guarded as they should be, and killing is easier than scavenging..."

  MOJ_ncr_raids: "NCR Raids"
  MOJ_ncr_raids_desc: "The NCR disgraced the Brotherhood decades ago. They've never been friendly towards the Mojave Chapter, often firing upon our patrols, and now the time has come to repay them for their lack of hospitality. Mojave Outpost will be left in ruins, Camp Golf will burn. This is what happens when you fuck with the Brotherhood."

  MOJ_contact_the_west: "Contact The West"
  MOJ_contact_the_west_desc: "Finally the day has come for the Mojave Chapter to reunite with the Western Brotherhood. Hardin's campaign of death and destruction has seen many spoils transferred to Hidden Valley's armoury, and his results are sure to please the West. Now all we can do is wait to hear back from him."

  MOJ_aggressive_policy: "Aggressive Policy"
  MOJ_aggressive_policy_desc: "Shoot first and ask questions later: that's what Hardin has drilled into the minds of his soldiers. The Mojave Chapter is hanging on by a thread, surrounded by enemies, it simply cannot afford mercy any longer. In Hardin's quest to scorch the Mojave with laser burns, kindness and mercy are relics of the past. All that matters is whether you can shoot straight, and how high your daily kill-count is."

  MOJ_mcnamara: "McNamara"
  MOJ_mcnamara_desc: "With control wrested from Elijah, McNamara had a hard road ahead of him. Lacking the support of the West, and with the NCR and Legion both heading on an impact course centred on the Mojave, The Mojave Brotherhood needed to open up to the world at large."

  MOJ_progressive_thought: "Progressive Thought"
  MOJ_progressive_thought_desc: "Opening our doors to the Mojave also means opening our doors to the troubles of the wastes. Not only that, but the emergence of a highly militarized, power armour wearing warriors makes the locals nervous and distrustful of us. A possible solution would be to arm and train local peacekeeping and militia forces in the lands under our protection, bringing them into the fold."

  MOJ_the_future: "The Future"
  MOJ_the_future_desc: "The future of the Mojave Chapter hangs in the balance. Elder McNamara plans on enacting a twofold plan to ensure our continued existence. First, we must ally ourselves with the NCR, through treaties or self annexation. Secondly, we will pledge ourself to the cause of helping the Mojave's scattered settlements."

  MOJ_ncr_negotiations: "NCR Negotiations"
  MOJ_ncr_negotiations_desc: "Our first step in achieving peace in the Mojave is guaranteeing the safe passage of both of our nations' troops in the Mojave. To that end we have prepared a message to send the NCR, proposing that they be allowed to patrol our lands in exchange for possible mutual support in the future."

  MOJ_ncr_trade: "NCR Trade"
  MOJ_ncr_trade_desc: "Regardless of their response to our last negotiation, opening trade between our two groups will benefit us all."

  MOJ_ncr_alliance: "Treaty of Sloan"
  MOJ_ncr_alliance_desc: "Entering into formal military pact with the NCR will ensure we can focus upon our internal stability and borders, while also keeping us safe from other possible enemies who we could not beat on our own."


  MOJ_help_the_needy: "Help The Needy"
  MOJ_help_the_needy_desc: "Our superior technology could be used to great effect improving the state of medical care within the Mojave. Even just the reintroduction of proper pre-natal care and childbirthing practices will make a huge impact in yearly population numbers. Proper medical facilities will also allow us to build rapport with the denizens of the wastes."

  MOJ_incorporate_the_followers: "Incorporate The Followers"
  MOJ_incorporate_the_followers_desc: "Several of our clinics have been visited by members of the Followers of the Apocalypse. While we are more militant than them, we share a common goal of improving the Mojave, and their extensive expertise will greatly improve our research efforts. It will also, however, allow them to spread their ideals of non aggression from a position of power within our ranks."

  MOJ_wastelander_recruitment: "Army of the Mojave"
  MOJ_wastelander_recruitment_desc: "Truly, our work in the wasteland has been bountiful for both the chapter and those under its protection. Patrols of Men at Arms and Knight-Paladins keep our lands free from threats, clinics keep our people free of disease and mutation, and our network of farms and ranches supply us with food, leather, and strong warriors. The time has come to finally allow those in our lands to join the Brotherhood."

  MOJ_mcnamara_militia: "Incorporate local militia forces."

  MOJ_hardin_recruits: "Form Knight-Paladin squads from unnecessary Scribes."
