  tool_engineering:0 "Tool Procurement"
  tool_engineering_desc:0 "Our production facilities need tools — urgently. In order to maintain high production rates and supply our soldiers on time, our elders have proposed two solutions: salvaging and simplification. Prioritising our salvaging teams would enable us to find and equip our workforce with the best tools available, whilst concentrating on simplifications in tool design would enable mass production of necessary equipment."

  maketool_engineering_1:0 "Improvised Tools"
  maketool_engineering_1_desc:0 "Using our basic understanding of toolmaking, we can use the materials in the immediate environment of our workshops to improvise basic tools on the fly. While the results are hardly impressive; using scrap metal knives, rebar clubs, and other basic tools is much more effective than simply using our hands for everything.\n\n"
  maketool_engineering_2:0 "Basic Tools"
  maketool_engineering_2_desc:0 "Stone is the bedrock of the world — literally. Stone tools are the crucial first step towards civilisation, or in our case, greater production efficiency. Improving on our primitive, improvised designs by incorporating ergonomics and greater reliability will make our tools easier to use and maintain."
  maketool_engineering_3:0 "Standardised Tools"
  maketool_engineering_3_desc:0 "Standardised tool designs can be quickly manufactured with widespread blueprints, and used interchangeably between labourers. Gone are the days of individual tool designs with their quirks and advantages. What we lose in personalised ergonomic design we gain in nation-wide, standardised equipment, designed to perform its role as effectively as possible in anyone’s hands."
  maketool_engineering_4:0 "Refined Tools"
  maketool_engineering_4_desc:0 "As our equipment becomes more advanced, so too must the tools which produce it. Refining our designs to assuage the need for precise tools our workforce now faces, while keeping the basic mechanisms as simple as possible, will allow us to increase efficiency without inflating production times."
  maketool_engineering_5:0 "Advanced Tools"
  maketool_engineering_5_desc:0 "The time has come to modernise the armoury of our nation’s labourers. Controlled bolting tools such as torque wrenches, bolting pumps, and tensioners will form the backbone of our armour production industry. New stamping tools will enable rapid mass production of small arms on an unprecedented scale. These tools, and many more like them, will bring our factory workers one step closer to the old-world."
  maketool_engineering_6:0 "Pre-war Tools"
  maketool_engineering_6_desc:0 "With the aid of our nation’s finest, we have been able to restore, rebuild, and replicate tools of the pre-war. Our labourers carry tools that other nations would idolise as standardised equipment: the atom powering their efforts to create the finest equipment known to man. From fusion powered plasma cutters, to Saturnite drills — our workers use science to give our soldiers the best equipment possible."

  scavtool_engineering_1:0 "Scavenged Tools"
  scavtool_engineering_1_desc:0 "Prospectors and armed guards can be sent out in search of salvageable pre-war factories, bags in hand, to strip their interiors of any and all useful equipment. Dead men need no tools. With these tarnished pre-war implements at their disposal, our craftsmen can make superior equipment out of more durable materials.\n\n"
  scavtool_engineering_2:0 "Tracking Dogs"
  scavtool_engineering_2_desc:0 "Hounds can be trained for a number of purposes: chief among them hunting and tracking. By raising and training dogs to recognise the scents of industrial chemicals, oil, tool steel, etc; we can more easily find and explore pre-war deposits likely to contain undiscovered equipment."
  scavtool_engineering_3:0 "Quadrant Searching"
  scavtool_engineering_3_desc:0 "Rather than searching sites of interest as they please, our prospectors can instead adopt a search tactic used prominently by pre-war investigators. Splitting large areas up into numerous smaller quadrants, each prospector can now search their zone for salvage in an orderly fashion. This turns larger areas into manageable smaller chunks: making for efficient and productive scavenging."

  pre_agriculture_industry_tech:0 "Organised Agriculture"
  pre_agriculture_industry_tech_desc:0 "An organized agricultural system based on more than the need of our people will help a lot if a cataclysm were to happen, and allow us to have reserves and cultivate more varied crops. Such a system is essential to the survival of our people."

  agriculture_industry_tech_1:0 "Seed Selection"
  agriculture_industry_tech_1_desc:0 "Seed selection is the process of selecting which seeds while be planted based on varying self determined criteria. These include, possible yield, resistance against diseases and other environmental threats and nutritional value just to name a few."
  agriculture_industry_tech_2:0 "Plant Cultivation"
  agriculture_industry_tech_2_desc:0 "Cultivation, Loosening and breaking up (tilling) of the soil. The soil around existing plants is cultivated (by hand using a hoe, or by machine using a cultivator) to destroy weeds and promote growth by increasing soil aeration and water infiltration."
  agriculture_industry_tech_3:0 "Crop Rotation"
  agriculture_industry_tech_3_desc:0 "Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of dissimilar or different types of crops in the same area in sequenced seasons. It is done so that the soil of farms is not used for only one set of nutrients. It helps in reducing soil erosion and increases soil fertility and crop yield. "
  agriculture_industry_tech_4:0 "Irrigation"
  agriculture_industry_tech_4_desc:0 "Irrigation is the application of controlled amounts of water to plants at needed intervals. Irrigation helps to grow agricultural crops, maintain landscapes, and revegetate disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of less than average rainfall."
  agriculture_industry_tech_5:0 "Industrial Fertilizer"
  agriculture_industry_tech_5_desc:0 "The Haber process, also called the Haber–Bosch process, is an artificial nitrogen fixation process and is the main industrial procedure for the production of ammonia. Ammonia is a vital component of industrial fertilizers. Though Ammonia can also be gained through Brahmin Dung."
  agriculture_industry_tech_6:0 "Automated Harvesting"
  agriculture_industry_tech_6_desc:0 "The process of harvesting plant produce has always been an arduous, but now with the aid of robotics will this challenge dwindle away, once more giving rise to higher productivity."
  agriculture_industry_tech_7:0 "Genecrops"
  agriculture_industry_tech_7_desc:0 "Genetically modified crops are plants used in agriculture, the DNA of which has been modified using genetic engineering methods. In most cases, the aim is to introduce a new trait to the plant which does not occur naturally in the species."

  basic_industry_tech:0 "Industry Planning"
  basic_industry_tech_desc:0 "While scattered workshops have fulfilled our need thus far, we cannot go further into improving our system without industrial planning. While the specifics are not decided yet, regrouping them together and cooperation between each one should already provide us with benefits and pave the way for further reform."

  generalized_industry_tech_1:0 "Work as Needed"
  generalized_industry_tech_1_desc:0 "Working based on demands and not quotas provide numerous advantages. Doing so allows us to react faster to changes from the frontline, as we are more in touch with what our soldiers need, and we can thus more easily switch the required production. It also frees up parts of the workforce to join the battle, if the need is ever present."
  generalized_industry_tech_2:0 "Local Workspaces"
  generalized_industry_tech_2_desc:0 "Instead of pulling populations away from villages, and into our factories, we can set up a system of local workshops, letting our people work without leaving their family and loved ones. Combined with regular supply convoys that also take in any produced goods to a more centralized location, this increases the flexibility of our industry as whole villages can be dedicated to manufacturing a specific equipment, letting them become more skillful in their field of expertise."
  generalized_industry_tech_3:0 "Public Projects"
  generalized_industry_tech_3_desc:0 "Public projects dedicated to improving the lives of the people in cities and villages will let them have better habitations and sanitation systems, while the open access to anyone to work on simple parts of the projects will have them gain basic skills in engineering and instill work discipline as well as appreciation of hard labour into all of our population."
  generalized_industry_tech_4:0 "Backyard Workshops"
  generalized_industry_tech_4_desc:0 "Massive distribution of tools and some materials to all interested individuals lets them form their own backyard workshops, spurring innovation to increasing heights while the close proximity of such workshops will let anyone, even the wounded or elderly, participate in the war machine. Special courses dedicated to teaching children the values of hard work and innovation will spur our future generations to work even harder."
  generalized_industry_tech_5:0 "Rapid Prototyping"
  generalized_industry_tech_5_desc:0 "Studies of pre-war CNC machines and basic electronics allow us to equip every single one of our factories with rapid prototyping sub-sections. Such sub-sections possess intuitive machine tools letting any worker propose and then test any improvements they think could be made to a particular item. It allows unrivaled level of ingenuity and continuous improvement to our manufacturing methods."
  generalized_industry_tech_6:0 "Three Dimensional Printers"
  generalized_industry_tech_6_desc:0 "Three dimensional printers are an extention of our rapid prototyping machines. Sporting a computer interface and easy to use tools, they allow much easier experiments aiming to simplify production. Some larger models are even used to replace entire production lines by themselves!"
  generalized_industry_tech_7:0 "Replicators"
  generalized_industry_tech_7_desc:0 "Replicators are the pinnacle of our manufacturing doctrine. A single item is first thought of and designed on a printer machine before being pulled in the replicator, which gives us perfect copies of the intended items. This allows literally no flaws in our system what so ever, extremely fast changes to the desired item production and accelerated production levels previously thought unthinkable."

  specialized_industry_tech_1:0 "Work Assignments"
  specialized_industry_tech_1_desc:0 "Working via a system of quotas and production targets let us work at a much better pace and manufacture more equipment in a given time, wasting no time on simplifications. As it should be, as our equipment engineers should be in charge of that. Our production lines work at maximum capacity in this manners, but are somewhat inefficient when it comes to sudden manufacturing changes."
  specialized_industry_tech_2:0 "Dedicated Workshops"

  specialized_industry_tech_5:0 "Assembly Lines"
  specialized_industry_tech_5_desc:0 "True assembly lines consist of workers acting as cogs in a well oiled machine. Each device we seek to manufacture is put on a moving belt and workers scattered a different points of said belt. They each add one element, or inspect one part of the device, thus maximising the efficiency of each and every one of them. Industrial output vastly benefits from such measures."
  specialized_industry_tech_6:0 "Robotic Workers"
  specialized_industry_tech_6_desc:0 "More and more mechanical workers in our assembly lines means that each and every step of the manufacturing process is made faster and with more precision than if by human hands, and such machines can run day and night under crew supervision such as rotating shift foremen and engineers tasked with maintaining them."
