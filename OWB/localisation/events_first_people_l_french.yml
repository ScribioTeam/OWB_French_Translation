 nf_event_fp.1.d:9 "Our forefathers called the great war 'the time of smoke and fire'. We survived by being prepared. The smartest people in our community foresaw a war coming and predicted it would be quick and end in total devastation on both sides. We build shelters, the mother mounds. Not quite vaults, but good enough to let us survive comfortably with enough goods stored to bridge the time we needed to spend underground. What did we have in abundance?"

As soon as we decided to come to the surface again, we contacted the other groups to come together to discuss how to proceed further. This ended in us signing the Accord of First People's Junction.

 nf_event_fp.4.d:9 "The first full scale stickball match took a while to get going. There are various versions of the rules that are half remembered by the participants and judges and nobody could agree on a single one. Some wanted to go with the lacrosse rule set, since it had the most comprehensive rule set of all variations survive the war. Others wanted to go back to more traditional versions that got passed down through generations. In the end a weird mix of multiple rule sets was adopted as the new 'official' stickball rules. The game lasted a good four hours and ended with a brawl because one team didn't agree with the final score. All in all, everyone agreed that they all had a good time and should repeat it as soon as possible."

 nf_event_fp.5.t:9 "Une Décision Difficile à prendre"
 nf_event_fp.5.d:9 "La bande de raiders qui se cache dans le PIT a transformé l'ancien lieu d'apprentissage en un labyrinthe de pièges. Comme ils sont lourdement armés, cela signifie que nous pourrions les éliminer, mais que nous ne pourrions pas le faire sans subir de lourdes pertes. Nous pourrions essayer de les raisonner, mais ce n'est pas non plus une garantie de succès, car les raiders écoutent rarement la raison. Cela peut aussi les amener à prendre conscience de nos desseins et à s'enfoncer encore plus profondément. Quoi que nous fassions, tout le monde doit participer et nous devons prendre une décision collective sur la façon de progresser à partir de là."

 nf_event_fp.6.t:9 "Nous envoyons les Troupes"
 nf_event_fp.6.d:9 "Après de nombreuses discussions sur l'opportunité d'envoyer des troupes, la décision a été prise d'expulser les raiders par la force. Comme il s'agissait d'une mission où il y avait de fortes chances de marcher sur une mine ou d'attraper une balle, un appel de volontaires a été lancé parmi les troupes des trois nations, avec la promesse d'une double rémunération pour toute personne s'engageant. Malgré la mort attendue, un nombre important de soldats se sont engagés. Si c'était à cause de leur sens du devoir, l'imprudence ou leur cupidité est difficile à dire. \n\nLa bataille proprement dite s'est déroulée sans incident. Les deux premiers soldats malchanceux sont tombés dans quelques pièges, mais par la suite, notre peuple est devenu plus prudent dans son approche. Cela ne veut pas dire qu'il n'y a plus eu de pertes de vies humaines après ce point, mais les progrès ont été lents et réguliers.\n\n	L'autoproclamé Seigneur du Pit nous attendait dans un laboratoire au rez-de-chaussée qui a été transformé en quelque chose qui ressemble à une salle du trône. Il a commencé à nous parler de son destin, qui était de régner sur les grandes plaines, lorsque l'un de nos soldats a mis fin à ce destin très tôt, d'une balle bien visée à la tête. \n\nLe 'Seigneur' a amassé une quantité appréciable de capsules et d'autres objets de valeur dans sa salle du trône, ce qui pourrait rendre cette mission plus intéressante que l'utilisation inhérente du PINT. Les soldats ont également appris quelques leçons sur la façon de survivre à des situations comme celle-ci, soit par leurs propres actions, soit par le malheur de ceux qui ne reviennent pas."
 nf_event_fp.6.a:9 "Bien !"

 nf_event_fp.7.t:9 "Nous essayons de négocier"
 nf_event_fp.7.d:9 "Sending in our troops just to die to makeshift explosives and hidden spike traps does not seem like a good way of solving this issue. Especially if we can do it without loss of life. Maybe if we extend the same courtesy, that of not losing their lives, to the Lord of the Pit and his goons we can come to an agreement that satisfies both parties.\n\nApproaching with a small team of negotiators showing a white flag, in the hopes that the raiders knew what that means was the tensest moment of the whole operation. Surprisingly enough, they were not shot immediately and actually managed to get a parley started. This led to the Lord of the Pit and his men giving up the PIT to us, as long as we promised them no repercussions for anything they did while being in the raiding business and a permanent place in our ranks. This actually may benefit us in the long run in different ways. More people capable of handling weapons is always good. Also, while crude, their defences showed an impressive level of ingenuity, which we surely can apply to other construction efforts. And the Lord of the Pit himself is a capable leader managing to keep a raider gang together for multiple years."

 nf_event_fp.100.t:9 "The Big Question"
 nf_event_fp.100.d:9 "Our nations have grown closer and closer in recent times and we have danced around a particular topic for a while now. Should we jump over our own shadows and become one nation and one people? While it would make us a force to be reckoned with in the area, there are not only upsides to it. Even with our already close cooperation, it will still be a while before the new nation would run as effective as the individual ones. And some might argue that some things that make our people unique will get lost in the shuffle.\n\nWhat do we vote?"

 nf_event_fp.200.t:9 "Visions d'une Femme Inconnue"
 nf_event_fp.200.d:9 "We received a report that last night two hunters received what they called 'a vision'. \nAfter a rather unsuccessful hunt they were prepared to head home when they heard strange noises seemingly coming from everywhere at once. Looking for the source of that noise they spotted a woman that suddenly appeared 'like an illuminated shadow' a few dozen meters away from them. She was wearing loose robes and carrying bundles of grain. Cautiously the hunters approached her. Before they could get too close she only said the words \"Come to me.\", pointing westward. At this point a map appeared next to her in thin air, looking similarly ethereal to her. The hunters said they were certain that it showed a location at the end of the Arkansas River. Then the woman disappeared again in a flash of light. The hunters ran back to their outpost as fast as they could to report what they have seen.\n\nThere has already been a lot of discussion what this 'vision' means. The Choctaw storytellers say that this event bears a striking resemblance to one of our ancient legends. The Cherokee Council of Scientists and Engineers says the 'vision' could be reasonably easily achievable giving the right technical know-how and resources. But all of this means that someone went to great lengths to bring this message to us. Too much effort for this to be a simple trap. Even if it would be somewhat of an undertaking to make the trip, chances are the result will be worthwhile, even if just to satisfy our curiosity."

 nf_event_fp.201.t:9 "Calm Beginnings"
 nf_event_fp.201.d:9 "The first stretch of our journey has been rather calm so far. The weather is fine and we are making good time towards our goal on the Arkansas River. Though we barely left Federation lands, so this is to be expected. And even beyond that, the influence of the Last Patrol can still be felt, even if they are not as powerful as they once were. but soon we will travel into mostly unknown territory and who knows what will happen there."
 nf_event_fp.201.a:9 "Onwards"

 nf_event_fp.202.t:9 "Getting the Hell out of Dodge"
 nf_event_fp.202.d:9 "We knew the calm couldn't last forever. We were roughly a third of the way to our goal when we encountered what we think are the ruins of Dodge City. Not only were we slowed down by ruins of buildings having crashed into the river, we also noticed several corpses hanging from the few intact bridges we crossed under. This put the guards already on edge, people mentioning spotting movement on the river shore didn't make it any better. Nothing happened for a while until a shot from a ruin took the head of a guard on the starboard side. The crew started to hunker down, guards went into cover and exchanged fire with an enemy they couldn't actually see. The captain put some strain on the engines to get out of the area as fast as we could."
 nf_event_fp.202.a:9 "Faster!"

 nf_event_fp.203.t:9 "Forging New Paths"
 nf_event_fp.203.d:9 "The river clearly went some new (or possibly old) paths in the years since the war. We came across a partially flooded village that it now snaked it's way through. The local wildlife was not particularly fond of us passing through it, but didn't pose any real threat to us. Mirelurk are hard to kill due to their thick shells, but their pincers could not pierce our ships hull. The Mirelurk Kings were a different thing all together, but they were scarce enough among the regular mirelurks that we could pick them off early, before their sonic attacks could harm anyone. While nobody was injured, we were happy to get past this area and into more open water again."

 nf_event_fp.204.t:9 "Restocking"
 nf_event_fp.204.d:9 "We spotted some untouched looking buildings on our port-side, including a supermarket and a hardware store. We decided to stop and look if we could find some useful supplies in it. We indeed found some. We also found out that what we thought were a couple of dead bodies were instead a mass of feral ghouls in their resting state. The noises of our shopping trip woke them up and they began shambling towards us. We decided on a hasty retreat with way less loot than we planned on getting out of the market."
 nf_event_fp.204.a:9 "Better hungry than dead."

 nf_event_fp.205.t:9 "The Audience"
 nf_event_fp.205.d:9 "We finally arrived at what we thought was our destination. We were greeted by a group of tribals seeming to have expected us, surprisingly enough accompanied by a mister handy robot. They accompanied us to a grand hall that housed a giant woman. She was resting on something obscured by smoke and strange lights, but it was clear that if she would stand up she would tower over many a building. This was definitely the woman that our hunters saw in that night. Some of the scientifically minded people in our group quickly pointed out the projectors placed in the corners of the room. We could assume that the 'vision' we received was done in a similar vein, though it is not quite clear where the origin of the projection was from during that event. The talk with the 'Goddess Diana' as the tribals called her was pleasant but we could not shake the feeling she expected us to be more deferring and awed by her presence then we were. What we were impressed by was the reason she brought us here.\nHorses. Honest to god horses. We were pretty sure there weren't any around anymore. She basically confirmed that suspicion by saying that these horses were specifically 'produced' to survive in the wasteland by some machines hidden away in a secret place. And they were a gift to us.\n We had to quickly figure out the logistics of putting them on our boats somehow and keeping them safe on the long trek back home. Also some doubts became loud among crew and expedition members about why she would gift us something like this. What were her motives? We are not sure and hope she won't ask for a favor in return at some point."
