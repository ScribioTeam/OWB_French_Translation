The TAA is built upon the idea of a "Contractual Society"; one that's ideally based purely on voluntary action, entirely unhampered by violence or threats. While a high degree of power is wielded by corporations and wealthy families, the system of government itself has come to be known as Todd Howitzer's "Contractualism".

Having grown up in an influential family, Todd's greatest challenges were his siblings; the many other heirs to the influential Howitzer family's name and property. With a little preferential treatment from his father Todd had managed to secure a hegemony on the family's assets, name, and titles; this wasn't the end to his ambition however, as it didn't take long for him to cut right through the bottom line. His most successful endeavor was peddling as many weapons as he could to neighboring raiders, mutants, and just about anybody else in the wasteland who could afford TAA prices. Todd now stands at a precipice in his company's history, with hard work —and a little luck— he could very well carve out a heaping part of the wasteland for himself."

When the baron demanded to see a warrant and drew a pistol, the officer shot her in the hand. For the past six hours since the happening, there have been calls all across the territories calling for the end of rule from Gloria.

There was a general air of confusion on what exactly what happened. Legionary Raids? A Sunset Invasion? Nuclear attack? It all became clear when reports started piling in; this was a coordinated attack from multiple barons across the Estate's territories. The same barons that had been causing such a huge fuss over the RRG's new regulations have decided that they'd be better off free than paying taxes, and that they wanted the Howitzers to call the shots. \n\n Now, one of the most important rules of business is such: If the waters are calm, don't rock the boat. So naturally, the notion of bombing their neighbors just to get around a few regulations they could bribe their way out anyway of seemed like something of a poor reaction. It didn't much matter now, if the RRG was allowed to come back across the river it'd dismantle the whole system from top to bottom, so Todd now longer had a choice in the matter; the Militias were raised, barricades built, and plans were drawn for the coming war."

Guerra treated any of our criticisms like treason, claiming on one hand that they were an existential threat, and on the other nothing more than a band of raiders!

Further, Guerra pointed out, if the rumours to the south were true, there might be more opportunities down Mexico Way in the near future... opportunities which would require access to Rio's territory.
