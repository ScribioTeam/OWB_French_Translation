 tribal_starter_tech:9 "Organized Military Society"
 tribal_starter_tech_desc:9 "Our tribal society integrates conflict into its culture, interwoven deeply into civilian life itself. Many member of our tribe know how to hunt and fight, and that from a young age. Focusing our efforts towards additional firearm training as well as basic tactics will allow us to have parents and mentors do the job of officers and drill sargeants, drastically reducing expenses."
 tribal_enforcer_defense_tech:9 "Military-Purpose Changes"
 tribal_enforcer_defense_tech_desc:9 "Enforcers are traditionally deployed to keep the peace and pacify any region that is particularly unruly, but our lack of heavy infantry is making itself known. We would do well to adapt them to better strategical use. Military training, reinforced armor, and integration in warrior squads will do just that."
 tribal_enforcer_hard_attack_tech:9 "Specialized Weaponry"
 tribal_enforcer_hard_attack_tech_desc:9 "Our heavy infantry currently is only equipped with a standard LMG, making them ineffective against hard targets. To solve this problem, we can instead mount cut-down automatic rifles under their right arm, while the left arm mounts a crude "lascannon" using an entire energy cell's capacity per shot to pulverize armor."
 tribal_enforcer_soft_attack_tech:9 "Ammunition Backpack"
 tribal_enforcer_soft_attack_tech_desc:9 "The heavy armor that Enforcers wear make it hard to properly wield a firearm, much less reload it. To rectify this, we can modify their weaponry to a belt-fed design, and allow them to carry an ammunition canvas backpack from which to feed from. Not only will this resolve the problem of unwieldy reloading, but also vastly increase their firepower."
 tribal_enforcer_speed_tech:9 "Heavy Armor Mastery"
 tribal_enforcer_speed_tech_desc:9 "Refining the design of the Enforcer's armor, with council from veterans, let them take advantage of its unpowered nature to a surprising degree. The level of training of our heavy infantry allow them to even follow our warriors on paths and trail that no power armor could take, striking where no forces would suspect."
 tribal_enforcer_org_tech:9 "Unpowered Armor Doctrine"
 tribal_enforcer_org_tech_desc:9 "While they may seem crude compared to true power armor, our heavy armor is more mobile, better armed for sustained conflicts, and able to operate with as much resources as our warriors. We must take advantage of that fact, and integrate them with light infantry to a degree no power armor could ever hope to achieve, surprising the enemy with thick plating and guns blazing."
 tribal_infantry_defense_tech:9 "Explosive Proficiency"
 tribal_infantry_defense_tech_desc:9 "While having the lay of the land is all well and good, a massive amount of explosive will never hurt. Integrating warrior sappers into our ambush squads, able to set surprises in the enemy's way just before a hail of gunfire, will surely improve our defensive capabilities. Even the most isolated of detonation will surely put our enemies on edge, destroying morale."
 tribal_infantry_hard_attack_tech:9 "IED Training"
 tribal_infantry_hard_attack_tech_desc:9 "Further training and supply given to our sapper warrior can let them now plant anti-tank IEDs around possible areas of operation, as well as traveled road. Using weight-sensitive plate allows them to detonate only in the presence of enemy armored assets, destroying treads and, for some of the craziest sapper, entirely gutting the vehicle in the blast."
 tribal_infantry_soft_attack_tech:9 "Covered Volley Fire"
 tribal_infantry_soft_attack_tech_desc:9 "Endurance training given to our warriors can make them able to easily scale obstacles in the terrain, and use the most treacherous of locations as ambush points. The main point is to use our light elements as frontline skirmishing units behind well-placed cover, while our heavier weaponry is brought to bear from unexpected angles, cutting down enemy infantry."
 tribal_infantry_recovery_tech:9 "Military March"
 tribal_infantry_recovery_tech_desc:9 "By refining our endurance training for stamina management in addition of rough terrain climbing, we can make our warriors more physically fit and allow them to be on the move more often. Keeping them in peak conditions can help increase their strategical mobility, and get them to recover from tactical movements faster."
 tribal_infantry_org_tech:9 "Informal Militia Formation"
 tribal_infantry_org_tech_desc:9 "Encouraging the formation of town guards and militia in our villages will not only help keep the peace, but also give our youngest members an early taste of what military life is like. Formation training and basic combat tactics alongside marksmanship training is thus taught in civilian life, giving us disciplined and organized warriors once they join our army."
 tribal_construction_tech:9 "Infrastructure Standardization"
 tribal_construction_tech_desc:9 "Moving away from free-form designs and random building placement, we can standardize such structures as housing, factories, trails and other such infrastructures. The benefit of it is the fact that it is much easier to improve, build and maintain them, as they are now considered the new norm."
 tribal_aa_building_tech:9 "Aerial Harassment"
 tribal_aa_building_tech_desc:9 "Innate knowledge of the terrain and its features allow us to place our anti-air weaponry in hidden locations that few pilots would ever suspect. Every cave could hide a machinegun, every mountain could be a stronghold, the enemy will never be allowed to fly unopposed."
 tribal_production_tech:9 "Scavenging Efforts"
 tribal_production_tech_desc:9 "Our recon and hunting parties more often than not stumble upon old-world ruins, ripe for the taking and full to the brim with resources, but they rarely touch them out of superstition or lack of knowledge. Educating them on scavenging techniques as well as providing a reward can give us regular influx of material to study, and supply to use for manufacturing."
 tribal_occupation_tech:9 "Soft Occupation"
 tribal_occupation_tech_desc:9 "If we wish to keep occupied nations content, we should first and foremost seek a more delicate approach. They think of us maybe as savages, but we should prove them otherwise, or at least keep our suppression operations on the down low. Propaganda operations such a food distribution and infrastructure construction will let the public opinion turn in our favour."
 tribal_political_power_tech:9 "Integrated Tribe Elders"
 tribal_political_power_tech_desc:9 "Who knows better what our people need than our revered tribe elders? Aware of many problems in our society, as well as ways to resolve them, we should seek to apply said solution as quickly as possible to improve the situation of our brothers and sisters. With our tribe unified, having better living conditions and taking a more important part in our decisions, they will more readily support our actions."
 tribal_bomb_protection_tech:9 "Deception Tactic"
 tribal_bomb_protection_tech_desc:9 "To protect our infrastructure from bombardment, we must be ingenuous and go beyond what the enemy would ever expect. Constructing a wide network of cheap and quickly-built fake factories, imperfectly camouflaged to attract enemy recon, will deceive and distract from our actual activities, allowing us to proceed with impunity while the enemy wastes bombs on our decoys."
 tribal_construction_tech_2:9 "Communal Projects"
 tribal_construction_tech_2_desc:9 "With the tight-knit culture of our tribe, we can easily convince most of our brothers and sisters to willingfully give their time on communal projects, making the village participate in the construction of infrastructure for their defense, or well being. Higher manpower can thus be organized efficiently to let us build structures faster than our teams could hope to achieve."
 tribal_construction_tech_3:9 "Civilian Education"
 tribal_construction_tech_3_desc:9 "For the members of the tribe willing to go even further in helping our effort, we will organize classes directed by our engineers, teaching them the basics of repair and construction. While they wouldn't by any mean be able to operate by themselves, rudimentary knowledge in these matters will give our construction team educated labor, needing less direction and working efficiently."
 tribal_production_tech_2:9 "Artisan Villages"
 tribal_production_tech_2_desc:9 "By separating and categorizing our needed production and assigning them on a village per village basis, we can build in those location a pool of general knowledge and proficiency, vastly increasing our ability to manufacture anything we could want. With time, these villages shall become known for their masterful work, as generations share their knowledge."
 tribal_production_tech_3:9 "Equipment Study"
 tribal_production_tech_3_desc:9 "While we could never hope to match more advanced nations in term of industrial capacity, we can, however, steal or buy some of their technology and blueprints. Studying them should allow us to apply their knowledge and lessons to our own equipment, removing unnecessary parts and smoothing manufacturing procedures."
 tribal_production_tech_4:9 "Local Innovation"
 tribal_production_tech_4_desc:9 "Integrating both external lessons and internal innovation, we could achieve production capabilities few nations of our kind are capable of. The members of our tribes are now educated, intelligent, and able to constantly improve anything from the design of our equipment to our manufacturing methods."
 tribal_aa_unit_tech:9 "Anti-Aircraft Projector"
 tribal_aa_unit_tech_desc:9 "An ad-hoc anti-air weaponry relying more on fear and suppression than actual firepower, it function as a mortar would, projecting a high-explosive shell at low altitude where a timed fuze makes it detonate into an impressive puff of black smoke and shrapnel. The simple design combined with a breach-loading system allows an extremely high rate of fire, saturating the airspace with explosions."
 tribal_climate_tech:9 "Adaptation Doctrine"
 tribal_climate_tech_desc:9 "Our warriors are hardy, and used to living off of the land. To make use of this, we will organize multiple hunting and scouting parties as soon as we arrive in a location, letting them get a lay of the land, supplement their own rations, and adapt quickly to new conditions. This should make them much more effective in any type of terrain, as well as help with future operations."
 tribal_resistance_tech:9 "Resistance Cells"
 tribal_resistance_tech_desc:9 "To relieve the task of resistance operation from the untrained member of our tribes, we will form and train specialized resistance cells, organized and armed with hidden weapon caches scattered throughout the terrain. Warrior training and sufficient weaponry will allow them to be much more effective when conducting operations, and to protect our brothers and sisters even under enemy occupation."
 tribal_command_power_tech:9 "Local Command Staff"
 tribal_command_power_tech_desc:9 "Integrating warriors and elders into our command staff will let us direct our forces more efficiently. Indeed, our soldiers tend to know best when it come to local tactics and movements, while our elders can provide wisdom and council to our decisions to know what is best from their vast experience. All this will let us structure our army around an effective and experienced command staff."
 tribal_recovery_tech:9 "Improved Field Rations"
 tribal_recovery_tech_desc:9 "For generation our tribe has been able to feed off of the wasteland, hunting and gathering with ease. But now that we field a proper army, one of the most important thing is to keep them fed. Adapting our techniques to provide tasty and easily preservable field rations such as lifestock jerky, trail mix or pemmican will drastically improve moral. A well-fed soldier is also a motivated and energized one."
 tribal_reliability_tech:9 "Inherent Mechanical Knowledge"
 tribal_reliability_tech_desc:9 "Instilling into our population a sense of mechanical knowledge as well as curiosity from a young age is a good way to build up cohesion, along with better understanding of our equipment. With time and outdated firearms to experiment with, our soldiers can become able to field strip and clean their weaponry more efficiently."
 tribal_attrition_tech:9 "Terrain Knowledge"
 tribal_attrition_tech_desc:9 "From the desert to the marches, and even to the mightiest ruins of the old world, our forces have attained a level of knowledge unmatched by any other army. Where others would waste time, supplies and even men to the harshes of the wastes, we thrive, and easily avoid such troubles. Being able to find sustenance anywhere also reduces our supply need, allowing us to fight much farther from our lines."
 tribal_recon_tech:9 "Civilian Reconnaissance"
 tribal_recon_tech_desc:9 "An effective way to easily gain intel on enemy movement is to "grease some palm" as some would say. Paying merchants and hunters around the area to provide information to our troop will let us easily discover enemy movement in the area. After all, if you pay a merchant enough he might just give you that nice military map he snatched at the enemy command post during his last supply run."
 tribal_reinforce_tech:9 "Militia Skirmishers"
 tribal_reinforce_tech_desc:9 "Posting militia squad around low-threat area of our frontline let us tie up and delay any enemy element. Instructed to engage only in favorable conditions and to immediatly fire off flares, they are trained as skirmishers first and foremost, using the terrain to their advantage to only take light casualties until our tribesmen can engage the enemy properly."
 tribal_hard_attack_tech:9 "Combined Arms AT Doctrine"
 tribal_hard_attack_tech_desc:9 "Coordinating our existing AT rifle crew with raider units is an effective way to improve our capabilities against hard targets. With the rifles immobilizing tanks or herding them into minefields, the raiders are easily able to storm their position and destroy them, be it in a huge explosion from a demolition charge, or with the satisfying sound of a breached hatch."
 tribal_piercing_tech:9 "AT Rifle Mastery"
 tribal_piercing_tech_desc:9 "Extensive training and internal knowledge of our anti-tank rifle by their wielder has made every one of them deadly combatant. Able to use the terrain more effectively than any other, and possessing unmatched precision and familiarity with their weapon, this let's them attain impressive fire rate while still being able to splatter enemy tank crew through viewports and weakpoints in a single well-aimed shot."
 tribal_coring_cost_tech:9 "Citizen Concern"
 tribal_coring_cost_tech_desc:9 "Contrary to what many seem to think, in no way do politicians and officiers matter when stabilizing a region. Indeed, the most important part of any pacification is the people. Focusing first and foremost on changing their lives as little as possible, as well as providing for their needs and concern whenever possible, will give us the support of the common citizen, and allow us to integrate regions more efficiently."
 tribal_bucket_o_bolts_tech:9 "Tribal Pride"
 tribal_bucket_o_bolts_tech_desc:9 "While we have learnt a lot from the foreigners, we must never forget we are entirely different from them. We cannot match them, yet we are superior. Our knowledge of the waste is unparalleled, our weaponry proficiency is unmatched, and the trust in our brothers and sisters is a bond that no battle could ever hope to break."
