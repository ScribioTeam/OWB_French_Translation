Indeed, American propaganda was so strong that it still has a lasting effect on the ghouls of Bellingham some 200 years later. The emphasis on liberty, and American world dominance, have become key to Bellingham's fiercely independent culture."

However, there was nowhere near enough houses to accomodate the influx of people, and instead everyone had to become used to a more nomadic lifestyle. As knowlegde of their past withered away between successive generations of apocalypse survivors, the importance of constantly moving and adapting remained core to the tribe."

  vip_legacy_of_great_snake_desc:0 "Decades before the Vipers were forced to flee California by the Brotherhood of Steel, the Vipers worshiped their Great Snake god. Their entire lives and cultures revolved around the Great Snake, and its poision: sacrifices were made to it, its poison was ritually cosumed and weapons were made smothered in its venom. While the \"Pit\", where the Great Snake resided, was destroyed by the Brotherhood when they finally drove the Vipers from California, fragments of the Vipers' old religion remains. One of the most important lessons that has survived the hard years the Vipers have wandered in the wasteland is regaarding survival of the fittest. Sure, some half-decent cannon fodder may die before their time, but this way the Vipers are strong."

  vip_a_broken_tribe_desc:0 "When a band of Vipers set upon a patrolling group of the Brotherhood of Steel in 2155, they had no idea who they were making enemies with. In the resulting fight the leader of the small Brotherhood patrol group, a certain Maxson II, was struck and fatally injured by a poisoned arrow. Unfortunately for the Vipers, Maxson II was none other than the Brotherhood's High Elder: his death stirred the Brothehood up into a genocidal fury. By 2261, after 6 years of being hounded relentlessly by the Brotherhood, the Vipers finally shattered. Bands fled across America, with some settling in the Mojave, some in Nevada and some as far afield as the Hounds of Hectare. The Vipers are a mere shadow of their former selves."

Blessed by their proximity to the Rio Grande river and the large cattle herds that grazed the area before the Great War, Pecos has survived and thrived through a heavy focus on cattle rearing. Their wealth of knowledge when it comes to post-apocalyptic animals makes them skilled hunters and influential brahmin herders: the Colony hosts almost as many Brahmin as it does people."

  sho_outcasts_once_again_desc:0 "For centuries after the arrival of European colonists in America, the Shoshone made their home in the rough terrain of the west. Of the many Shoshone groups, a significant number settled in Utah and southern Idaho, and achieved federal recognition in the late 1900s. Like many other Native American Nations and Tribes, the Shoshone fared resonably well in the post-apocalytic wasteland: their ancestoral teaching proved useful in an era of hunting and gathering, and the reservations the USA threw many native groups in were remarkably undamaged by nuclear hellfire. However, trouble began for the Shoshone in the decades after the nuclear ash began to settle. Utah and Idaho became stricken by religious wars: a huge variety of neo-christian groups, all with their own twisted interpretation of the bible, decided Utah should be theirs. Between the zealouts in Heavens Gate, the \"pious\" in High Chapel and the schism between Murtagah and the Lord's Annointed, the Shoshone found themselves being persecuted from all sides. Eventually the Shosone were forced to flee west, away from their ancestral land, where they remain plotting their next move."
