  flw.1.d: "Reports from the front tell a worrying tale, Enemy troops are being relocated to the border of [?Global.flw_defender_state.GetName]! This is far too close to our borders to just be routine training exercises, our treacherous neighbours must be preparing for an attack!"

  flw.2.t: "Political Repercussions"
  flw.2.d: "Despite our best efforts to ignite a small scale conflict for [?Global.flw_defender_state.GetName], it seems that we've simply failed to create the momentum needed to justify an attack like this; in light of such circumstances we're forced to step down, lest we risk a full scale conflict."

Time will tell whether or not what border forces we do have will be able to win the day."

Instead, the two powerful factions of the Aztlán Empire are at each other's throats, and rumour has it that the Itzan War Council are begging [ITZ.GetLeader] for intervention.

 flw.7.t:9 "Our Drugs are Spiked!"
