 # Focuses
  tla_sysinit:0 "Booting Up"
  tla_sysinit_desc:0 "Tlaloc was one of the many innovations of prewar America's military industrial complex.

  tla_war_emergency_desc:0 "Scouting bots from the front have returned with unfortunate news; one of Chico-net's many sworn protectorates has been attacked by an outside aggressor! Bound by programming —and something approaching sympathy— he, and his closest followers are roused to war."
  tla_restore_factories:0 "Restore Factories"

  tla_pacification_subroutines:0 "Pacification Subroutines"
  tla_pacification_subroutines_desc:0 "Tlaloc's Pacification subroutines have gone unused for years now, briefly seeing service against the Aztlan, and never since.

  tla_awake_and_angry:0 "Awake and Angry"
  tla_awake_and_angry_desc:0 "A dormant God has woken from his slumber, with his people, domain, and bounty all under threat, he is angry. Across Tlalocan factories shift into heavy industry, and eyebots hover around populated areas, distributing notices of conscription to confused wastelanders. Tlaloc was the Aztec god of rain, hopefully his foes brought an umbrella."
  tla_victorious_protector:0 "Victorious Protector"
  tla_victorious_protector_desc:0 "The people of Mexico rejoice today! As their protector Tlaloc announces to the world that the war is won, and once more they are safe.

  tla_agriculture:0 "Sowing the Seed"
  tla_agriculture_desc:0 "We do not age, we do not sleep, we do not hunger, and yet, we are dying.

  tla_economic_industrial_repairs_desc:0 "Non-Chico-net and Chic-not subsidiary based infrastructure has long been ignored by our reconstruction bots, due to its obviously inferior and non-proprietary construction.

  tla_extraction_centres_desc:0 "Tlalocan employees are responsible for the majority of our post-extraction material processing, but are unable to extract these resources themselves, we should therefore stockpile all resource extraction centres so that our plants can continue to operate past the cessation of automated functions."
  tla_worker_recompensations:0 "Worker Recompensations"
  tla_worker_recompensations_desc:0 "It is true that we have not always been as...aware of our employees basic needs and functions, as we are now.

  tla_feeding_the_people:0 "Feeding the People"
  tla_feeding_the_people_desc:0 "Zapata has done well, and ensured that the people of Tlalocan will be warm, furnished, and fed on our departure. His talk of revolution is strange, and inefficient, but we can rest well, knowing he truly cares for the people of Mexico."

  tla_recognising_service:0 "Recognizing Organic Services"
  tla_recognising_service_desc:0 "The lands of central Mexico are littered with little enclaves of humanity clinging to life alone, unaware of Tlaloc and his power.

  tla_reconciliation_awareness_workshops:0 "Reconciliation Awareness Workshops"
  tla_reconciliation_awareness_workshops_desc:0 "Though Tlaloc tries his best to protect and please the people of Mexico, his stunted speech corporate attitude means that at some point or another he's done something to upset just about everybody in the wastes.

  tla_organising_the_people:0 "Organising the People"

  tla_preemptive_compliance_actuators_desc:0 "With conscription comes the occasional issues of draft dodgers, or citizens just flat resisting government efforts to bolster the army.

  tla_consumer_pacification_protocols:0 "Consumer Pacification Protocols"
  tla_consumer_pacification_protocols_desc:0 "Though great evil lies to the north in what used to be the lands of "Arizona" and "New Mexico", it would border neglect to ignore the dormant threat to our south.

  tla_gift_itz_desc:0 "We do not share much common ground with the Itza, even at a glance they look no better than any other warmongering blood tribe of the south.
