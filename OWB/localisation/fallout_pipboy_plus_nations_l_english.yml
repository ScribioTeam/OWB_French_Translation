  PIPBOY_PLUS_NATION_TEXT_ANT: "Nestled within the National Antelope Refuge north of New Reno, The [ANT.GetName] live out their lives in peace. Surrounded by mercantile and aggressive entities alike, they prefer to keep to themselves and live simple lives. They roam throughout the Black Rock Desert and beyond in search of salvage and prey. Their scrap of land is largely undesirable and desolate, like much of the wasteland, keeping conflict to a minimum.  The little conflict they've faced has been with the neighbouring Cyclops Tribe. Despite their isolationist and peaceful nature, their heated relations with the Cyclops have continued for generations. Few pleasantries are exchanged between their hunting parties. Relations are warmer along their southern border with New Reno. Antelope hunters often make the trip to New Reno to sell furs and crafts if they've strayed far south of the Black Rock Desert. Although trade with Chemult station is preferred, the capital of sin offers many luxuries and services the former cannot provide.  Recreational drugs are often bought en-mass from New Reno, alongside ammunition and tools.\n\nAlthough the tribe's name originated from their location alone, centuries later antelopes have become a central part of their cultural identity. Mature antelopes are ritualistically butchered, and their components used for many crafts. Antelope horns are often used to create elaborate headdresses worn by hunters; with hunters expanding upon their design as they become more seasoned. Antelope hide is an essential part of clothing and identity within the tribe, seen as more valuable than the hide of other animals. To own an antelope coat, let alone a bedroll, is a high honour. The meat of their livestock is perhaps most valued of all, used in large community stews for great events. Antelopes are sacred to the tribe, and are killed sparingly. Hunters and foragers have special importance to the Antelope Tribe because of this.  Livestock rearers, those who raise and protect the antelopes, often hold religious authority.  Outsiders who are permitted to enter the lands of the tribe often share stories of their rich culture far beyond their borders. On rare occasions, outsiders are presented with talismans of carved antelope horn. These talismans are important protective charms to the tribe, and are imparted with great religious and emotional significance. It is said the Desert Buck eternally safeguards those who carry its icon."
  PIPBOY_PLUS_NATION_TEXT_ARM: "Occupying the northern portion of Mexico's east coast, the [ARM.GetName] lives up to its name. Comprised of unwilling conscripts enslaved by the robotic serfs of the army's leader, it strives for the reconquest of Texas. Every day, the \"citizens\" living under the Army's control work, willingly or not, in its factories and dockyards. Its robotic taskmasters leave no room for error, ensuring the entire working population is productive. Workers are rewarded with a paltry amount of ration tokens, the bare minimum for a wage. Construction, salvaging, resource extraction, and farming are roles staffed by humans and overseen by robots. Escape from this draconian society is nigh impossible due to the nature of its ruler. The watchful eye of the ever-present A.I. Santa Anna will mercilessly hunt down those who dare to go against its grand vision. Escapees are regularly dragged back to their housing blocks, or for repeat offenders, publicly executed.\n\nThese extreme methods are employed not to be cruel, but due to a fundamental error with the overlord itself. Human lives are considered a valuable resource by Santa Anna, but a resource nonetheless. Resources are collected to be spent after-all. No one citizen of working age should go unused either, for wasting resources is wasting time, and time is something Santa Anna doesn't have. Its central authority, Tlaloc, is rapidly dying. Refusing to accept the inevitable fate ahead of itself, the A.I. will continue to charge ahead into the future; preparing for a war that may never come. The Army of Mexico is an army with a nation, not the other way around."
  PIPBOY_PLUS_NATION_TEXT_ARR: "Founded in 2167 by the Vault Dweller and their followers, the city of [ARR.GetName] has a turbulent history. Its location on the very edge of the N.C.R.'s sphere of influence has lead to many problems. In spite of this, its sheltered position in the great canyons has shielded it from most harm. Although originally consisting of relatively few people, Arroyo's population has blossomed into one of the most diverse found on the West Coast. Generations of warm external relations have contributed to the village's growth and prosperity. Arroyo has emerged as one of the Wasteland's most advanced and forward-thinking cities. Its sphere of influence extends beyond its own city limits, extending out into the vast wasteland beyond. Because of this, Arroyo holds notable sway over major players, such as the N.C.R., New Reno, and Vault City.\n\nArroyo has suffered many hardships despite its success in the modern age. In 2242, the Enclave attacked the city of Arroyo, capturing its residents to bring back to the Poseidon Oil Rig. Those who refused to surrender lost their lives, and only one man survived, the Chosen One. Returning to find his village in ruins, the Chosen One would eventually find and free his people; as well as put an end to the Enclave's sinister plan. Arroyo's long lost relatives, the residents of Vault 13, were also on the Poseidon Oil Rig. After their rescue, they decided to stay and rebuild Arroyo rather than travel hundreds of miles back home. Their technical expertise, combined with the tribe's survival skills, ushered in a new era of prosperity for Arroyo. As for the Chosen One, his actions forever immortalised him, and he went on to become the next Elder of Arroyo. He continues to lead his people to this very day, and will no doubt chart a path through the troubling times ahead."

Cartel was one one of the greatest empires of illicit trade in the old world, but now exists as little more than a shell of its former glory, clinging to what territory they have left in §YCore Region§!. Operating out of the once prosperous city of port city of §YMazatlan§!, while supporting territory that reaches up the coast and into the mountains as far north as §YNuevo Ideal§!. Their territory is a largely lawless region that has been built to be a fortress over the last few decades, focused heavily around key mountain passes and routes that they use to smuggle goods between the §YRepublic of the Rio Grande§! To their northeast and the §YViceroyality§! to their direct south. Along their longest, northern border, the enforcers of §YBeltran-Levya§! fight an unending battle with the zealous tribes of the §YFree Fighter Federation§!, which now holds the vast majority of their former territory. \n\nThe §YBeltran-Levya§! Cartel once had a fairly in depth organizational structure that allowed them to control much of the §YSinaloa§! region's trade, but failed to hold onto it in the face of the onslaught that was the rise of the masked luchador cults. Falling back into their own territory at an ever increasing rate, the cartel nearly crumbled inward during the last hundred years, and has only been propped up by a handful of brutal leaders and vicious policies. As a result, until recently cartel was a largely decentralized institution with innumerable gangs and sects vying for control of their scattered territory, often at the cost of profit and land. All of this changed with the rise of the §YBandido Sangriento§!, or as he'd be called in English, the Bloody Bandit of §YBeltran-Levya§! \n\nThe §YBandido Sangriento§! started as a simple enforcer for one of the leaders of the then crumbling §YBeltran-Levya§! Cartel, and quickly gained a terrible reputation for his overwhelmingly brutality towards the communities of his enemies. After a strike gone too far, in which the §YBandido Sangriento§! wiped out a small farming community for what was widely considered to be a minor slight, he was sentenced to death by the cartel. After being shot several times and thrown into a pit in the middle of, the §YBandido Sangriento§! returned as a mutated ghoul, claiming that his hatred was too great to let him die. Within a decade, he had wiped out the old guard of the §YBeltran-Levya§! cartel, and centralized them into a personal army, with which he intends to reclaim all of his lost lands."

  PIPBOY_PLUS_NATION_TEXT_ITZ: "The §!Chichen Itzan Empire§! originates from a small tribe on the Yucatan peninsula. These founders worshipped the old gods, those of the Mayan civilizations millennia before them, and based their activities around the Chichen Itza, a huge step pyramid that survives to this day. Over the next century, the Itza gradually spread their influence, consuming the entire Yucatan peninsula and spreading northwards along the coastline. It was during the initial ascendancy of the empire that the Itza's focus on the sea began. The Itzan navy, beginning from a few small fishing boats, rapidly grew to become the terror of the Gulf of Mexico. During these years the fleet mainly operated a piracy policy, choosing to raid settlements on islands or on the coast for their wealth, which then passed back to the capital. \n\nAs a result, the Chichen Itza and the town that sprang up around it flourished in the first century of the Itza's existence. Other major coastal towns also did very well for themselves, enjoying strong naval trade links with each other. These cities in turn paid the agricultural workers inland for their labour, creating an efficient network of commerce that relied on raids and conquest to keep itself sustained. \n\nHowever, in the year 2102, a new foe was sighted by the Itzan army. They wore cloaks like eagles, and seemed to observe similar rituals to the Itza themselves. The first exchanges with this new civilization were friendly, but in 2139, things got hairy. Both the Itza and the Aztlan, unbeknownst to the other, had launched an invasion of [TDT.GetName], a large inland tribe following similar customs to both groups. Both sides were met with initial success against the [TDT.GetNameDef] forces, but a fatal clash occurred in October that would set the tone of the relationship between the Aztlan and the Itza forevermore. Both sides mistook the other for [TDT.GetName], and in the bedlam that ensued some 40,000 troops were killed or seriously wounded on each side. The first formal war soon followed, a three-way struggle for control of [TDT.GetName], and lasted for three years as each side vied for control of ridges and rivers. The war ultimately ending inconclusively, to the great embarrassment of both the Itza and the Aztlan. \n\nThe war proved to be the first of many, and from 2139 to 2228, the Itza and the Aztlan were locked in a perpetual border conflict. Hundreds of thousands of lives were extinguished in the jungles and hills of the borderlands, and thousands more were extinguished on the temples across the Itza to appease the war gods. Whilst the fighting was inconclusive, one thing was becoming apparent—the Aztlan were gaining the upper hand. At every major battle from around 2190 onwards, the Aztlan were able to field more men and, crucially, their feared Jaguar warriors. Slowly but surely, the Itza were being beaten back by the Aztlan war machine. \n\nThe Aztlan's war machine reached its zenith in 2228. Under brilliant generals, the Aztlan were conquering territory on an unprecedented scale, and once the Aztlan's northern foes had begun to crumble they turned their hungry eyes on the Itza. For two years, fierce fighting scarred the jungles. A war the Itza initially thought was just another clash swiftly became a war for survival. The bleak situation was none the more apparent than at the Battle of the Balsas River, where an entire Itzan army was outnumbered, outmanoeuvred and subsequently thoroughly routed. More than half the force was killed or captured in the battle alone. The remaining Itzan forces began a headlong retreat to the Yucatan peninsula, hounded continuously by the Aztlan forces seeking to destroy them once and for all. \n\nOn the 12th of March 2232, the routed Itzan forces reached the Papaloapan River. By the orders of the current monarch, Gustavo Fontirroig, the bridges across the river had been destroyed. Whilst this temporarily protected the Yucatan peninsula from the advancing Aztlan forces, it also trapped the remnants of the Itzan forces on the wrong side of the river. Desperate and all but broken, they tuned and faced down their foe one last time. The Battle of the Papaloapan River ensured. \n\nItzan forces, tired and underequipped, initially crumbled against the Aztlan's Jaguar vanguard, but then destiny rolled the dice once more. A young general named Sebastián, no more than 19, climbed to the top of the hill on which the Itza seemed doom to die on. Upon reaching the top, he found chaos. Most of the Itzan commands structure had either retreated or been killed by a stray artillery shot. Sebastián knew that order had to be wrung from the chaos, or the Itza were doomed to die. At first nobody listened to his ideas, but soon a single unit of the Ejército, the elites of the Itza, followed his orders. Under his leadership, the unit succeeded in breaking a weakly defended portion of the Aztlan line, breaking out of the encirclement. Whilst the Itzan force was too disorganised to capitalise on the breakthrough, Sebastián's forces succeeded in snatching much-needed medical supplies and ammunition before falling back. Seeing his bravery and tactical brilliance, more and more units of the Itzan forces pledged to follow his lead, until the entire army, or what remained of it, was under his command by the early evening. \n\nTired and bloody, Sebastián ordered his men into defensive positions for what he thought would be the last stand of the great Itza Army. The Aztlan, spearheaded by a seemingly endless quantity of Jaguars, began their charge. Fighting ensured into the early morning, as the Itzan forces continuously retreated up the hill, reforming their defensive circle in an organised fashion. The circle, according to Sebastián's orders, was composed entirely of Itzan militia-infantry. Behind this front line, Sebastián placed units of the Ejército at regular intervals, ready to plug any gaps that may appear in the line, or exploit any gaps in the enemies. Whilst the plan was simple, it proved to be deadly effective. Not once was there a serious break in the Itzan line, and when the number of Itzan militia-infantry defenders began to become too thin to hold the line, Sebastián ordered a retreat up the hill, reducing the line's circumference. \n\nAs dawn crept over the battlefield an unexpected sight greeted Sebastián. Dead Jaguars scattered the ground, packed densely in front of the defensive positions he himself had devised. Ejército units still manned their posts, though most had passed out from tiredness, as the last Aztlan crumbled. Sebastián was adored by the soldiers who's lives he had saved. Over the following days the rest of the Itzan army, scattered across the Papaloapan River, rallied under him. It was clear Sebastián's army was now both the largest and finest fighting force in the jungle. \n\nThe dominance of Sebastián's force was shown once and for all two months later. The Itzan force advanced to the Balsas river once more, this time perusing rather than being pursued by the Aztlan forces. On the banks of the Balsas, Sebastián delivered a decisive defeat to the Aztlan once more, a crippling blow that ensured the Aztlan forces would never again threaten the Itzan homeland. \n\nSebastián's next move, however, was not to march into the Aztlan heartlands, as he was urged to do by the Itzan monarch. Instead Sebastián turned his army around, marching swiftly to the Papaloapan River before utilising his army to repair bridges and trade links. Three months later, he struck out again, this time marching into the Yucatan peninsula. There he and his army were met with widespread support, and men flocked to his banner. However, Sebastián refused to stop and regiment these willing recruits, telling them to return to their fields and ensure the country resisted any famine, whilst he marched on the Chichen Itza itself. When he got there, he purged the political elite that resided there as a form of revenge for cutting the bridges over the Papaloapan River. In a personal act of revenge, he killed the Kalomte Gustavo personally and publicly, before declaring himself the new Kalomte of the Itza. The King of Kings. \n\nOver the next 43 years, from his coronation in 2232 to 2275, the Kalomte Sebastián led the Itza from victory to victory. Of note was his decisive defeat of [TDT.GetName], driving them back over the Usumacinta River, as well the strengthening of trade and diplomatic links between the Itza and [GRH.GetName]. Now, at the dawn of 2275, the Kalomte is drawing up plans cement Itzan dominance across the entire Mexican coastline. "

This attempt was foiled by the Chosen One of Arroyo, which had been sacked by the Enclave in pursuit of test subjects for the biochemical weapons to be used in this scheme. The oil rig was sabotaged by the Chosen One and destroyed in a nuclear explosion, killing Richardson and many of the Enclave's leadership. Following this, some years later the Enclave base of Navarro was captured by an alliance of the NCR and Brotherhood of Steel, leaving nothing but shattered groups of remnants, hunted and persecuted throughout the wastes, incapable of rising up again.

In 2186 they declared themselves a republic and took on their eponymous name: electing a democratic council to write up a constitution and lead the nation. After 3 years the §YN.C.R.§! had grown from a small city to a federation of cities comprised of several prominent trading hubs. The §YN.C.R.'s§!

  PIPBOY_PLUS_NATION_TEXT_RRG: "The §YRepublic of the Rio Grande§! is a democratic nation founded on the principles of liberty, freedom from oppression, and equality for all. Originally a collection of American occupation troopers and the Mexican nationals under their boot, the early years of the nation were fraught with tension and strife. The R.R.G. was not always a democracy, however, and first existed as a self-imposed military dictatorship. After thirty years of preparation and rebuilding, the dictatorship was phased out for a fully fledged democracy which still functions in 2275."

  PIPBOY_PLUS_NATION_TEXT_SCR: "The §YScorpions§! are no different from any other raider gang: a motley crew of misfits, petty upstarts, and morally bankrupt punks. Unlike other raider gangs, however, they have managed to turn their small-time petty chem peddling gig into a fully fledged occupation of the south east of the §YCore Region§!. How exactly they managed to go from a gang of wannabee dealers to a large outfit of gun-toting gangers strong enough to threaten the region is unclear: but the cracks are already beginning to show.\n\nWhat is readily apparent however is that the §YScorpions§! have capitalised on one of the precious few trade routes into §YNew Vegas§!, harvesting the cap rich caravans heading east along the §YI-15§! for all that they're worth to prop up their failing operation. While control of the highway gives them a constant supply of fresh targets, it also puts them in constant conflict with well-armed caravan guards, and adds more unnecessary strain on their already stretched military.\n\nTheir large swathes of territory are in-of-themselves a problem due to the §YScorpion's§! inherent inability to effectively subjugate and control the population under their boot. The small towns within their occupied turf frequently arm militias and clash with the under-trained and disorganised raiders, causing tension within the already unwieldy ranks of the gang. In response to this they've spread even thinner: and the result has so far been a drop in combat performance, rampant factionalism and infighting, and mass desertion.\n\nAlthough this situation is fixable on its own, the looming threat of imminent §YN.C.R.§! involvement has effectively doomed the future prospects of the gang. Unless the §YScorpions§! can gain control of their own territory for long enough to fend off the impending §YN.C.R.§! clean-up operation, there is no doubt that they will not live to see 2281 as any more than a petty gang squatting in the §YMojave§!."

  PIPBOY_PLUS_NATION_TEXT_TAA: "The §YTexan Arms Association§! live by a simple creed: armed and dangerous. Throughout history, their ancestors armed themselves for independence, and to uphold the §YSecond Amendment§!. In 2275, the §YT.A.A.§! arm themselves not out of a sense of moral obligation, but as a way to survive and exert power over others. For centuries the §YT.A.A.§! has harnessed their wealth and knowledge to gain a leg up in the §YWasteland§!, and in the present day their manipulative presence is as maleficent as ever.\n\nThe §YT.A.A.§! can trace its origins to arms factories of old, its numerous \"families\" all descended from a plant or gun shop of some kind. The largest, wealthiest, and most influential of the families within the §YT.A.A.§! are those who hold numerous patents and have the workers to produce them: while the smallest are either mere vendors or specialist manufacturers being kept down by their competition. Fictionalisation is rife within the §YEstates§!, and many smaller families are beginning to cause trouble for the ruling hegemony\n\nFor decades the §YT.A.A.§! have had a stranglehold on the §YRepublic of the Rio Grande's§! politics, utilizing tools such as lobbying, bribery, and outright blackmail to get their way. This issue is compounded by the fact that the §YT.A.A.§! is a major supplier for most of §YMexico§!, regularly sending trade caravans deep into the §YLand of Titans§! to arm the conflicts of tomorrow. Tensions between the §YRepublic§! and the §YAssociation§! have never been higher—and that's just how they like it.\n\nNot all is well for the oligarchs, however. Their habit of selling quality arms to raiders for high prices has come back to haunt them, as numerous gangs are beginning to harass their northern settlements relentlessly. Meanwhile, profits are declining as the cost of hiring soldiers rises dramatically. Each family wants a slice of the pie, and none of them want to share. The §YT.A.A.§! must carefully consider how long it can afford to let current affairs carry on as they are, else they risk bankruptcy and dissolution."

  PIPBOY_PLUS_NATION_TEXT_UMB: "§YUmbra§! is a small, insignificant tribe on the western coast of the §YCore Region§!. They occupy a long strip of the coast north of §YNavarro§! up to §YArroyo§!, at which point their territory transitions to that of their closest ally. Their territory spans the valleys, passages, and plains between the §YBrotherhood of Steel§! and §YArroyo§!. Despite their precarious position, the lack of important settlements, resources, or pre-war facilities within their borders has left them relatively untouched by even the §YN.C.R.§!\n\nThe §YUmbra Tribe§! has a rich and complex culture centred around animistic beliefs. §YUmbra§! believe that the world is inhabited by and filled with spirits, who act as free agents and also as inhabitants of the body. They have various forms, but the kind you may most commonly find would be; stupid, evil, anger, and chaos spirits. The §YUmbra§! attribute characteristics like mental disabilities or amoral beliefs, and actions like wrath and violence to these sorts of spirits. They believe that spirits see things differently from how they communicate them, which forms a central belief in the §YUmbra§! that spirits must be interpreted to be understood even marginally.\n\nOf the many members of the §YUmbra tribe§!, a man named §YSulik§! is their most famous. Formerly a companion of the §YChosen One§!, the tribe maintains close ties to §YArroyo§! to this day due to their shared bond of camaraderie. §YSulik§! is the only known member of the §YUmbra§! to know of and communicate with a unique, named spirit: §YGrampy Bone§!. He communicates with his ancestor like all §YUmbra§! communicate with spirits⁠—by using the bone piercing in his nose. Through his otherworldly connection, he offered cryptic yet useful advice to the §YChosen One§!. §YFollowers of the Apocalypse§! regularly make the journey all the way up to §YUmbra§! just to observe the tribe, and attempt to uncover the strange truth behind their prophetic connections."
