ncr_puppet_subduing_warchiefs_desc:0 "While we may have pacified the majority of the region, the remaining raiders have yet to recognise their new lot in life. By making an example of the most rebellious of the warchiefs, we can convince the rest of the raiders to integrate peacefully."

ces_puppet_bull_victorious:0 "The Victorious Bull"
ces_puppet_bull_victorious_desc:0 "We couldn't stop them. We failed. They came in like the thunder and slaughtered us like cattle. Put our women and children in cages, conscripted the able men, maimed and butchered the unable ones. Years and years of culture and history, destroyed. How did it happen?"

ces_puppet_capital_siege:0 "The Burning of [Root.Capital.GetName]"
ces_puppet_capital_siege_desc:0 "Caesar wanted to set an example. After our empire fell, he marched his army all the way to our capital. He set it ablaze, burned it and locked innocent people inside of the buildings. The only comfort we can have for them is that they died free..."

ces_puppet_administratio_imperii:0 "The Administratio Imperii"
ces_puppet_administratio_imperii_desc:0 "The occupation arm of the legion, those ruthless men want first and foremost to make us slaves in service of their masters. They will use any mean they can to reach that goal, but what is their precise intention with us?"

ces_puppet_via_romana:0 "Via Romana"
ces_puppet_via_romana_desc:0 "A lot of work has been done to improve the roads leading to Caesar's empire, and our people has regarded such things with curiosity and weariness. We must warn them, there is little doubt that they only do this to increase the output of slaves and plundered resources. "

ces_puppet_roman_justice:0 "Roman Justice"
ces_puppet_roman_justice_desc:0 "More and more, criminals are executed and made an example of in gruesome ways. Public firing squad, decapitation, Crucifixion. And while some of these criminals were murderers and bandits, most of them were petty thiefs or intellectuals."

ces_puppet_new_nobility:0 "Ave! Duci Nova"
ces_puppet_new_nobility_desc:0 "The legion has been rebuilding small cities destroyed in their advance, but they are... different. They are dedicated to fueling their entrenchment efforts, and worked by enslaved populations. They are trying to chain our people to their factories."

ces_puppet_romano_tribalism:0 "Romano-Tribalism"
ces_puppet_romano_tribalism_desc:0 "Legion propaganda has been massively spread accross our lands, threatening and persuading our people to support their rule. They make wild claims of grandeur and huge promises, yet... some make sense. Their horrible tactics did indeed clean our territory from bandits and raiders. Could they have a point?"

ces_puppet_lingua_franca:0 "Lingua Romana"
ces_puppet_lingua_franca_desc:0 "Working to the base of our culture now, they teach our children and our youth the way of the legion and it's language. We cannot do anything but yield, and knowing some of their language will surely appease them in their cleansing, right?"

ces_puppet_when_under_rome:0 "When Under Rome"
ces_puppet_when_under_rome_desc:0 "They seem to have a saying over there, something about acting the same as the people of the city you are in. To lessen the massacres and crucifixions, we should heed those words, and act like legion citizens, as much as it pains us."

ces_puppet_decimatio:0 "Decimatio"
ces_puppet_decimatio_desc:0 "Huge ethnical cleansing spread throughout our lands. Any small clan or community that doesn't yield is annihilated, and any person caught talking negatively about the legion is either whipped or even crucified in the worst cases. How far did we fall..."

ces_puppet_punishing_profligates_desc:0 "Profligates, that's the name they give to degenerates. But for them, anyone not serving the legion and enslaving their family is one. As men refuse to take the cultural tradition of the legion, they receive whippings, savage beatings, and are even executed as an example."

ces_puppet_disenfranchisement:0 "Disenfranchisement"
ces_puppet_disenfranchisement_desc:0 "Little by little, they erode our rights. Already, we cannot choose, we cannot vote, and we cannot do anything but submit. They feed us less and less as time goes on, saying the rest will go to the legion to pay for it's /"protection/". Our people cannot withstand this much further..."

ces_puppet_separating_the_children_desc:0 "They've come during the night, in raids. They took our children away. So many of them. From what we can gather, they will be trained to become legion soldiers, or cannon fodder. Some people tried to fight back, they were... made an example of..."

ces_puppet_dissolute_become_whole_desc:0 "It is done, our will is broken, our hopes are dashed to the ground. How can we resist such might?

ces_puppet_the_evil_of_technology:0 "the Evils of Technology"
ces_puppet_the_evil_of_technology_desc:0 "As their influence spread, so does their doctrine. They talk about the evils of technology, how it destroyed the old world, how it will destroy the next. There is some wisdom in their words, and our population begins to heed their culture. Books are burned, machines destroyed, and engineers or scientists ostracized"

ces_puppet_roman_conscription:0 "Roman Conscription"
ces_puppet_roman_conscription_desc:0 "Press gangs of soldiers have been scouring the countryside, looking for anyone fit enough to serve the Caesar. Little attention is given to their situation, or condition, for as long as they serve, they will live."

ces_puppet_para_pax_bellum:0 "Para Pax Bellum"
ces_puppet_para_pax_bellum_desc:0 "He gave us the power to enact revenge! Before Caesar's rule, we were afraid, and we were powerless, but look at us now! Mighty, our ranks filling with soldiers, our lands clean of degenerate filth. We will retake what is rightfully ours! To war! Ave Legio! Ave Caesar! "

ces_puppet_the_new_pax_romana:0 "The New Pax Romana"
ces_puppet_the_new_pax_romana_desc:0 "Caesar is right, about everything. Out there, without his protection, we would be savages and profligates. Look around us, degenerates, raiders, tribals. Their lands are lawless and their people undisciplined. But now? We are those things. We will protect our lands from the savages, whatever the cost."

ces_puppet_aeternit_imperi:0 "Aeternit Imperi"
ces_puppet_aeternit_imperi_desc:0 "The eternal empire. This is what we have become. Caesar will lead us to victory, and so will our might.

Ave Caesar! Imperium Aeternum!"

bos_puppet_ad_victorium:0 "Bound by Steel"
bos_puppet_ad_victorium_desc:0 "Defeated by the monsters of steel, we can do nothing but submit and wait for their judgements. We fought valiantly, but their advanced technology gave them the edge, and now we must endure. Our population is weary and fearful, little is known about them. Will they be sadistic conqueror?"

bos_puppet_capital_siege:0 "Liberation of [Root.Capital.GetName]"
bos_puppet_capital_siege_desc:0 "The Brotherhood has decided to march on our capital. Our citizens lock their door and stare out of their windows, afraid of those hulking soldiers clad in power armors. What do they want? To they seek to gloat after our defeat?"

bos_puppet_hall_of_initiates:0 "Hall of Initiates"
bos_puppet_hall_of_initiates_desc:0 "They apparently seek initiates, new recruits for their army, and we can only oblige. Yet it is strange, it cannot be said it is conscription, they seem to want to uplift us. But what will their teachings be?"

bos_puppet_initiate_education:0 "Education for Service"
bos_puppet_initiate_education_desc:0 "Their auxiliary militia need men, soldiers willing to walk beside their armored silhouette. Already we have chosen our most hardy citizens to give to the invaders, for we thought of it as drafting. But they seek willing soldiers, and in exchange they will give us the gift of knowledge."

bos_puppet_drilling:0 "Drills"
bos_puppet_drilling_desc:0 "Our army, surprisingly, hasn't been disbanded once the country went under. If anything, it increased in size! Brotherhood advisors have watched our military drills as well as training programs, and have offered vast amount of improvements to them. This should make our forces into a more capable fighting machine, but what is their goal?"

bos_puppet_ideological_strength:0 "Brotherhood Propaganda"
bos_puppet_ideological_strength_desc:0 "Pamphlets, public speakers, humanitarian aid campaign, The Brotherhood is clearly looking for good PR. Yet can we fault them? They bring food and shelter to our population, it is only fair they gain some amount of trust in return."

bos_puppet_reintroducing_technology:0 "Reintroduce Basic Technology"
bos_puppet_reintroducing_technology_desc:0 "Out of every technology reintroduced by The Nrotherhood into our nation, air conditioning is the most appreciated one. While functioning terminals and working laboratories are all well and good, they displayed a certain bewilderment at seeing us more interested by fresh air than science. What do they know, their suits have integrated ventilation after all..."

bos_puppet_earning_our_place:0 "Earning Our Place"
bos_puppet_earning_our_place_desc:0 "The Chapter calls, and for their efforts toward improving our lives, we answer. We cannot idly stand by as they work for our benefit, we will warrant this privilege, and we will merit their respect! Let it be known we form exceptional auxiliaries, for we will earn our place alongside them!"

bos_puppet_scribe_initiation:0 "Scribe Initiation"
bos_puppet_scribe_initiation_desc:0 "For our efforts, we have earned the privilege to receive scribe initiation, in the same way any aspiring initiates would. Our military as well as people stands ready, we will pass this test!"

bos_puppet_learning_from_the_ancients:0 "Learning From the Ancients"
bos_puppet_learning_from_the_ancients_desc:0 "Our people seek more knowledge, and so they seek the relics of the old world. Scavenging teams are put in place, with every finding minutiously cleaned and studied for future use. The Brotherhood seeks those objects as much as us, and they could prove useful in the future."

bos_puppet_tutelage:0 "Tutelage"
bos_puppet_tutelage_desc:0 "With our army following the new training regiment to the letter, armored soldiers see that we seek to fill their ranks. The advisors have already requested to act as military advisors and drill supervisors, a request which we can only accept. How could we pass the opportunity for such a good example to strive toward?"

bos_puppet_old_world_medicine:0 "Old World Medicine"
bos_puppet_old_world_medicine_desc:0 "Arguably, what determines the level of a civilization is how well it's citizens are taken care of. As such, and to prevent any avoidable military casualties, a huge scavenging campaign of every clinic, hospital and medical facilities in our lands should improve our knowledge and let us developp new technologies."

bos_puppet_new_discoveries:0 "New Scientific Discoveries"
bos_puppet_new_discoveries_desc:0 "Our scientists have made a breakthrough! After such a long time improving our knowledge and expanding our technological operations, we have managed to make a new scientific discovery!

bos_puppet_power_armour_maintenance:0 "Power Armour Maintenance"
bos_puppet_power_armour_maintenance_desc:0 "As a symbol of trust, our nation has been assigned a small amount of salvaged power armor.

bos_puppet_art_of_war_desc:0 "If we are to become a fully fledged chapter, we need to be the very best, the cream of the crop. Our power armors have served us well, but what is needed is training and tactics. We will be fearless, strike fast and hard, destroy our enemies before they can even react."

bos_puppet_power_armour_training:0 "Power Armour Training"
bos_puppet_power_armour_training_desc:0 "Specialized power armor drills dealing with proper handling, maintenance procedure as well as battlefield repair will let us streamline our current design, accounting for the superior training of our troops, which can easily compensate. We need to focus on both quality as well as quantity, for if we manage to combine both, surely our enemies are doomed."

bos_puppet_wasteland_missions:0 "Wasteland Missions"
bos_puppet_wasteland_missions_desc:0 "New recruits, new auxiliaries, new initiates, we need all those and more. If we are to defend ourselves and strive, we must have more forces. Recruiting missions will be sent throughout the wastelands, asking for hardened soldiers to become knights. This should bolster our troops enough for us to take most foes head on."

bos_puppet_new_bunkers:0 "New Bunkers"
bos_puppet_new_bunkers_desc:0 "Fortifications are required for any military headquarters, and our allies have been kind enough to provide us with some of their low-level bunker designs.

bos_puppet_technology_raids:0 "Technology Raids"
bos_puppet_technology_raids_desc:0 "It's time to put all this practice and training to use. The Brotherhood has sighted dangerous technology around our territory, and tasked us with capturing them, as well as taking out any hostile asset. We will not disappoint, Ad Victoriam."

bos_puppet_paladin:0 "Paladin Initiation"
bos_puppet_paladin_desc:0 "Finally, we are deemed worthy. Our armed forces are to undergo official paladin initiation, and that will mean the hardest test for them.

bos_puppet_visit_from_the_elder:0 "Visit From the Elders"
bos_puppet_visit_from_the_elder_desc:0 "Elders from the [ROOT.OVERLORD.getName] have graced us with their presence, and as such we have been deemed worthy. A visit from them had widespread consequences amongst the population. Our people is now proudful and hopeful again, for they have given us water, electricity, and the opportunity to prove ourselves. We reiterate our pledge of allegiance, and promise our support toward the cause."

bos_puppet_new_chapter:0 "A New Chapter"
bos_puppet_new_chapter_desc:0 "All our efforts and training, all the people we lost, the people we met, the friends we made, the enemies we crushed, all lead to this.

Created from the ashes of the apocalypse, we rise to secure and protect our people, as well as contain dangerous technology. We pledge loyalty to The Brotherhood, now and forever!"

bos_puppet_semper_invicta:0 "Duty, Honor, Courage"
bos_puppet_semper_invicta_desc:0 "Those values are instilled in us since training. Our pride is well deserved, for we have served our chapter beyond expectation.

Never again will technology be allowed to destroy our world, our elite armored soldiers will make sure of this."

bos_puppet_the_art_of_rifle_maintenance:0 "The Art of Rifle Maintenance"
bos_puppet_the_art_of_rifle_maintenance_desc:0 "Proper field stripping and cleaning is indeed an art. Every soldier worth of this name should be able to strip their laser rifle, clean the lenses and the battery receiver, as well as check alignments and electrical conduits. Those rifles must be an extention of ourselves, and taken care of as well as we take care of our own body."
