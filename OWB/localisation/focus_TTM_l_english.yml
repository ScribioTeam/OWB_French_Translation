This will make them able to more easily find defensible positions and entrench faster."
  ttm_fire_ant_dna: "Fire Ant DNA"
  ttm_fire_ant_dna_desc: "The Fire Ant's genetical sequence and its potential application mostly pertain to its intrinsic understanding of its fellow ants, as well as organization in group. And while it would be horrifying to try and integrate a hive-like mentality, we can still splice more common trait like intrinsic body language understanding and pheromone dispersion."
  ttm_gecko_dna: "Gecko DNA"
  ttm_gecko_dna_desc: "Analysing and decoding the FEV-tainted genetical sequence of the Gecko was an extremely hard process that we thankfully managed to complete. It seems like it went through several rapid mutations during multiple generations, because of the virus. Splicing its DNA would make our people taller and faster, but also a lot more fertile."
  ttm_brahmin_dna: "Brahmin DNA"
  ttm_brahmin_dna_desc: "The hardy Brahmin which, from our analysis, seems to be a post-war descendant of the Brahmin cattle breed that could help in our early efforts for human experimentation. While we wouldn't go as far as integrating its eight-compartment stomach into our population, we could make do with its lessened need for water and improved digestion."
  ttm_advanced_specimens: "Advanced Specimens"
  ttm_advanced_specimens_desc: "The amount of sample we've collected is truly staggering, but our current splicing and sequencing capabilities can only do so much. Additional facilities shall be constructed and dedicated entirely to genetical experiments, as well as the storage of additional DNA sequences to further enhance our population."
  ttm_mirelurk_dna: "Mirelurk DNA"
  ttm_mirelurk_dna_desc: "Mirelurks have a much better natural understanding of the waves and aquatic environment that we could ever hope to. Its acquired DNA can still, however, be spliced and integrated into the population for better aquatic mobility as well as the ability to see correctly during dives even without goggles."
  ttm_radscorpion_dna: "Radscorpion DNA"
  ttm_radscorpion_dna_desc: "The Radscorpion's natural resistance to the direct light of the sun, as well as the heat or dryness of the air, makes its sequence perfectly suited for low-level splicing into all our citizens. Doing so will make them more hardy in desert-like climates, and have them enjoy increased comfort in most circumstances."
  ttm_wanamingo_dna: "Wanamingo DNA"
  ttm_wanamingo_dna_desc: "The mystic Wanamingo has its history surrounded by stories, tales and fables. The only thing we can be sure of, is that whatever that thing is, it definitively was engineered. We have found traces of biological weaponry manipulation pertaining once again to the FEV virus. Whatever the case, its strength and endurance could be spliced into our citizens."
  ttm_rumble_in_the_jungle: "Rumble In The Jungle"
  ttm_rumble_in_the_jungle_desc: "The corrupted G.E.C.K. has massively upset the ecological balance of The Nursery. If we are to restore order, we must make a choice, and do it fast. Shall we preserve the legacy of the old world, or take on the opportunity that Reese has given us?"
  ttm_old_world_wildlife: "Old World Wildlife"
  ttm_old_world_wildlife_desc: "We must never forget our original purpose, and the heritage of the old world. We shall destroy every trace of Reese's vile experimentation, and restore balance to The Nursery by helping the existing pre-war wildlife that has been there since time immemorial."
  ttm_new_world_fauna: "New World Fauna"
  ttm_new_world_fauna_desc: "Adapting to the new world and potential wasteland was always the prime directive of The Nursery since its idea was first dreamt up. We will move old-world fauna into more appropriate and contained areas, then direct our focus toward studying the wildlife the corrupted G.E.C.K. has created."
  ttm_avian_preservation: "Avian Preservation"
  ttm_avian_preservation_desc: "Particular care must be taken in preserving the fragile avian ecosystem of the nursery, threatened by the aggressive new flora created by the corruption. Cleansing any traces of it inside The Nursery should be enough to ensure their survival, and set us back on our path of study into their physiology."
  ttm_simian_preservation: "Simian Preservation"
  ttm_simian_preservation_desc: "The hideous fauna created by Reese's creation kit threatens even the simian preservation section of The Nursery to an extent we cannot tolerate. Our robotic divisions will relentlessly hunt down and incinerate any traces that those biological abominations ever existed, then resettle said simian into their habitats for study once again."
  ttm_strength_of_the_wild: "Strength of the Wild"
  ttm_strength_of_the_wild_desc: "Our continuous analysis of pre-war DNA sequences and its possible applications in genetical manipulations have led us to an extremely interesting breakthrough. It seems like the sequence of the common wasteland dog is close enough to the pre-war tiger to allow splicing! If done, this would make them considerably more effective in combat."
  ttm_new_world_fauna: "New World Fauna"
  ttm_new_world_fauna_desc: "Adapting to the new world and potential wasteland was always the prime directive of The Nursery since its idea was first dreamt up.

  ttm_dionaea_muscipula: "Dionaea Muscipula"
  ttm_dionaea_muscipula_desc: "Dionaea Muscipula, most commonly known as the Venus fly-trap or the 'spore plant', is the result of Reese's insanity, and have mutated into an hyper-aggressive as well as gigantic state. Their genetical sequence is interesting, as it shows heightened levels of poison and radiation resistance. This could certainly be useful for our agricultural research."
  ttm_victims_of_the_geck: "Victims of the G.E.C.K."
  ttm_victims_of_the_geck_desc: "Poor humans present when the corrupted G.E.C.K. was unleashed have been twisted into horrendous abominations, half-human and half-plant. We must take care of the least affected, and contain all that we can. Studying the changes induced in their physiology could potentially produce a cure, and help advance our medical studies considerably."
  ttm_strength_of_the_spores: "Strength Of The Spores"
  ttm_strength_of_the_spores_desc: "With the decoding of both wasteland flora and the corrupted strands originating from the G.E.C.K., we have managed to fully sequence the mutation the latter has inflicted upon biological elements. We could use this to our advantage and expose plants in a controlled environment for military use, providing support in marshes or jungles where they would thrive."
  ttm_advanced_cloning_research: "Advanced Cloning Research"
  ttm_advanced_cloning_research_desc: "The sample of Jurassic biological material we have acquired has been absolutely fascinating to analyse!

  ttm_memory_of_the_traveler_desc: "§MI remember now; he was a fun one to converse with, and throughout all of the hardship he endured, he never lost his wit. Over the years he's made a bit of a name for himself, but I haven't seen him in quite some time. I'm glad to have met him and I hope he is well.§!"
  ttm_memory_of_the_silver_tongue: "Memory of the Silver Tongue"
  ttm_memory_of_the_silver_tongue_desc: "§MIn hindsight, this one was more unpleasant to converse with. Deft with his tongue, they manipulated me like he did so many others and took something from me. If only I had known then what their intentions were§!"
  ttm_memory_of_the_prisoner: "Memory of the Prisoner"
  ttm_memory_of_the_prisoner_desc: "§MI remember now; when the Nursery was on the brink of collapse, they came to help. Demanding nothing in return, they simply restored the Nursery back to full health, out of the goodness of their heart. For that, I am forever grateful to them.§!"
  ttm_memory_of_the_student: "Memory of the Student"
  ttm_memory_of_the_student_desc: "§MI remember now; before the fighting, before the bloodshed. They were my student, and I taught them the ways in which we could heal the wasteland and its people.

All I can remember is their name and yet...I feel as if this is someone close to me.§!"
  ttm_the_factory: "The Factory"
  ttm_the_factory_desc: "A fully automated wonder able to manufacture even the legendary G.E.C.K., it is connected to every corner of the Nursery via an expensive system of trucks, trains and even AI-manned Vertibirds. Bringing it back online is essential to our efforts, and would let us even terraform the waste into its pre-war state with enough time!"
  ttm_a_paintbrush_for_the_wastes: "A Paintbrush For The Wastes"
  ttm_a_paintbrush_for_the_wastes_desc: "Sadly, it seems that the G.E.C.K. manufacturing line has fallen into a state of disrepair. Some of its capabilities such as the adaptational enhancement matrix could, however, be brought back online in each device with proper care. But unfortunately, the damage has been done, and its exact function would become... utterly random."

  ttm_refractoring_radiation_compression_device_desc: "Our knowledge of genetic engineering allows us to, with some effort, reactivates the R.R.C.D. sub-routine of the Creation Kit. A powerful genetic scanner, it automatically tracks corrupted DNA strands in fauna and flora, then purges said corruption and restores their original sequences. Its algorithm is extremely powerful, and could be put to good use."
  ttm_mass_relay_grassland_expander: "Mass Relay Grassland Extender"
  ttm_mass_relay_grassland_expander_desc: "Our existing agricultural research could allow us to reactivate the M.R.G.E. sub-routine of the Creation Kit. Its intended use was to supplement existing food production facilities with grassland prioritization during terraforming procedures. If we are lucky, it will activate and make the region more efficient in its food use, increasing water reserve as a byproduct."
  ttm_industrial_hillside_reforesting_network: "Industrial Hillside Reforesting Network"
  ttm_industrial_hillside_reforesting_network_desc: "The I.H.R.N. procedure is a general mass seeding program, possibly reactivated by our study of wasteland flora to calibrate it with. Intended for use in the centre of a nuclear blast to quickly terraform the centre of the blast, it makes heavy use of efficient power generation to fuel its operations, which we could recuperate after use for our own purposes."
  ttm_geologic_crystal_growth_prism: "Geologic Crystal Growth Prism"
  ttm_geologic_crystal_growth_prism_desc: "Applying our existing research into automated gathering systems could reactivate the G.C.G.P.'s sub-routine, pertaining to the creation of mineral deposits for resource-starved territories. While the activation would be random, it would still create additional deposits for us to mine, and increase our output of alloy in consequences."
  ttm_exponential_humidity_amplifier_system: "Exponential Humidity Amplifier System"
  ttm_exponential_humidity_amplifier_system_desc: "The E.H.A.S. terraforming package was integrated into the Creation Kit to help desert-like ecosystem recover from radiation waves. Its activation can be done with some efforts by using our wasteland soil study, and the infrastructure used to amplify humidity made to be rendered permanent, able to be scrapped once its purpose has been served."
  ttm_powering_production: "Powering Production"
  ttm_powering_production_desc: "Little by little, The Factory comes out of its slumber. Auxiliary generators come back online and manufacturing lines roar to life once again.

  ttm_power_of_the_atom: "Power of the Atom"
  ttm_power_of_the_atom_desc: "A simple solution would be to bring back online the integrated nuclear generators inside The Factory. But to do so would be... problematic to say the least. Should we really try to harness once again what brought humanity's end so many years ago? The benefits are enormous, but it would take considerable efforts, and the Twin Mothers tribe would surely disapprove"
  ttm_power_of_the_wind: "Power of the Wind"
  ttm_power_of_the_wind_desc: "Further study into wind-based power options could not only give a natural alternative to the many industrial generators barely keeping The Factory on, but would also make it much easier to design aerial design from our multiple aerodynamic studies. Shall we try to harness the power of the wind?"
  ttm_harnessing_heat: "Harnessing Heat"
  ttm_harnessing_heat_desc: "Geothermal sources can be found throughout the blasted hellhole that is the wasteland, and even within our own territory many areas have been designated as hazard zone because of the scorching heat. Installing geothermal generators over those areas could power The Factory further, and bring back some of its many additional functions."
  ttm_rising_waters: "Rising Waters"
  ttm_rising_waters_desc: "The power of steam might be the answer to our problem. By harnessing the tides of the Rio Grande river, and using steam generators placed alongside the coast, we could further power The Factory while still having only minimal disruption in the local fauna."
  ttm_natural_power_generation: "Natural Power Generation"
  ttm_natural_power_generation_desc: "The wind is a natural resource easily harnessed to produce energy, but it is inefficient, and as such we would need to gain considerable territory to be able to have a decent yield. Once it would be settled, we could construct massive frictionless wind farms to power The Factory, and bring back its mighty industrial capacity to life."
  ttm_renewable_energy_doctrine: "Renewable Energy Doctrine"
  ttm_renewable_energy_doctrine_desc: "Our already existing study into efficient energy cell recycling could be applied to existing infrastructure inside The Factory, improving its auxiliary generators into an hyper-efficient state closing in to the level of a breeder reactor.

I will honour your memory, and when the wastes has been freed from its horrors, the people shall forever say your name in reverence. Rest well, old friend.§!"
  ttm_console_his_family: "Console His Family"
  ttm_console_his_family_desc: "While Tlaloc's sacrifice is deeply honourable, and an example to us all in this hopeless wasteland, his children seem to all want to gain control of Mexico for themselves. As horrible of a choice it is, if we are to ensure its people is treated decently, we must choose who to throw our weight behind."
  ttm_protect_his_legacy: "Protect His Legacy"
  ttm_protect_his_legacy_desc: "We won't dare soil Tlaloc's memory and his last wish by engaging in the spiteful civil war his children have sought to wrought. To truly honour his legacy, we will fight for a better, more just world, and never forget his teachings for as long as we live. May you rest in peace, old friend. We will carry your torch from now on."

  ttm_wasteland_amazons: "Wasteland Amazons"
  ttm_wasteland_amazons_desc: "As sad as it is, if we are to keep our territory safe we must train even the tribe in the matter of warfare. For now they are uninitiated, but we could teach them and train them under the new regiment we have developed specially for human troops. Reforming the Twin Mothers into a competent military able to defend themselves should be a priority."
  ttm_keeping_our_girls_fed: "Keeping our Girls Fed"
  ttm_keeping_our_girls_fed_desc: "Guerilla training could be taught to the hunters of the tribe, to improve their effectiveness in all terrains and make sure they can provide a surplus of sustenance to the villages. As training, and under our supervision, they will go into the Forbidden Land, and report back with their prey."
  ttm_moon_light_runs: "Moon Light Runs"
  ttm_moon_light_runs_desc: "If our human auxiliaries are to be able to support our robotic forces, they must know how to move swiftly and quietly in formation. Organization training supervised by our tactical Robobrains will give them the experience needed to form an effective fighting force to help our cause."
  ttm_a_healthy_tribe_is_a_happy_tribe: "A Healthy Tribe is a Happy Tribe"
  ttm_a_healthy_tribe_is_a_happy_tribe_desc: "The tribe is now trained, equipped, and secure in the knowledge of their might as well as ability to defend their loved one. With Twin Mothers now transformed into the Amazons of the wastes, its warriors have become happy and healthy, able to feed and protect themselves. We can now set our sights further, and concentrate on advanced equipment research."

  ttm_building_a_society: "Building a Society"
  ttm_building_a_society_desc: "Now that our influence spreads across vast stretches of land, we must take great care in providing for the citizens of our land. A nation can only be considered such if it cherishes its citizens deeply, and so we shall enact vast reforms to the quality of life in our territory. Maslow's hierarchy shall be our guidance."
  ttm_automated_healthcare: "Automated Healthcare"
  ttm_automated_healthcare_desc: "The foundation of the Hierarchy pertains to physical needs, and sadly the state of healthcare in our land is pitiful. Our factories shall begin immediate production of vast numbers of medical robots, programmed to assist town physicians but not replace them, and provide sanitary, advanced medical care to all people under our rule."
  ttm_local_syndicate_councils: "Local Syndicate Councils"
  ttm_local_syndicate_councils_desc: "The second level of the Hierarchy deals with safety and security. By establishing local governance made by, and for the people, we are able to deal much more closely with the need of our people, providing reassurance that we are here for them, and shall always keep them secure against the horror of the wasteland."
  ttm_guns_for_caps: "Guns for Caps"
  ttm_guns_for_caps_desc: "The third level concerns the sense of belonging, the trust in a community, the warmth of friendship. With our forces having purged our land of most threats, we can now enact a vast information campaign. Our towns and villages shall be shown it is safe to once again live together, without the fear of the unknown. May they all put down their weapon, and never have to touch them again."
  ttm_moonlight_schools: "Moonlight Schools"
  ttm_moonlight_schools_desc: "The fourth level is about accomplishment, pride in oneself. To all that want it, we shall teach them the ways of life. People that never knew any better will have the opportunity to become engineers, physicians, scientists, and none shall be barred from achieving their dream by their conditions anymore."

  ttm_writing_a_constitution: "Writing a Constitution"
  ttm_writing_a_constitution_desc: "The final level is self-actualization, the full realization of one's potential. None of our citizens shall be held back, we will restore the light of democracy and human rights to the wasteland. With no need to defend themselves or fend for their lives, all shall be able to become their best self, and never shall this constitution protecting them be trampled!"

  ttm_create_a_codex_of_faith_desc: "It is under Diana's watchful and caring eyes that we have been saved, and it is because of her guidance that we have been able to prosper in the face of adversity and despair. It is time that we create a compendium of her deeds and how we may best show our appreciation for her as her devoted children."
  ttm_national_education_program: "National Education Program"
  ttm_national_education_program_desc: "Nations of old prioritized the education of their younger generations so that once their forefathers passed them the reigns, they would be ready to lead the way into the new age. We must educate our youth in Diana's ways and teachings so that when we pass, they will be able to carry on our work of restoring the land."
  ttm_dianas_voice_nationwide: "Diana's Voice - Nationwide!"
  ttm_dianas_voice_nationwide_desc: "§MAlthough many methods of communication were lost or destroyed during the Great War, many wastelanders still somehow have access to radios or devices that can pick up radio waves. To spread awareness of the Twin Mothers, I should create a radio station for Diana to reach out to those outside of our borders. I'm sure it's a novel idea; nobody else has a radio station made exclusively for an AI, right?§!"
  ttm_central_taxation_office: "Central Tax Bureau"
  ttm_central_taxation_office_desc: "As the old saying goes, the only things that are certain in life are death and taxes. The Twin Mothers doesn't explicitly promote death, but in order to promote the life and well-being of our citizens, we must levy reasonable taxes upon them in order to keep our administration and its programs functional."
  ttm_robotic_citizenship_act: "Robotic Citizenship Act"
  ttm_robotic_citizenship_act_desc: "The minds of artificial intelligence and autonomous robots are just as capable, if not more so, than those of humans, but very few societies past and present have recognized the disparity in rights between man and machine. It's time we passed some legislation that rectifies this issue."
  ttm_rebirth_of_the_EPA: "Rebirth of the EPA"
  ttm_rebirth_of_the_EPA_desc: "In the Old World degeneracy that was the highest levels of American government and academia, the Environmental Protection Agency and its efforts to preserve what remained were lights in the darkness. In this grim and terrible world, it can and will once again be such a beacon with us leading the way."
  ttm_rethink_greenways_vision: "Rethink Greenway's Vision"
  ttm_rethink_greenways_vision_desc: "Greenway's vision of building a new society from the radioactive ashes of the Old World was noble, but not ambitious enough. With Diana at the helm, we will not only create a new society for our people, but for all peoples of the wasteland. Our soldiers, with this goal in mind, will be better prepared to fight any evildoers that would dare oppress innocents."

  ttm_iron_rivers_tribe_desc: "Even the most narrow of rivers can pose a formidable obstacle to safe travel, and in the absence of reliable infrastructure such as bridges, we can only traverse these treacherous bodies with flimsy, small boats. The Iron Rivers tribe has the right idea of creating a select few, large steam-powered vessels for transport. Given the lack of alternatives, the idea is worth pursuing."
  ttm_iron_rivers_tribe_tt: "§gWhile our tribe tends to prefer smaller river boats to travel up and down the rivers the Iron Rivers tribe are known for their larger steamboat vessels. The many voyages across the river will be much easier using these safer vessels.§!\n"
  ttm_full_control_of_the_nursery: "Full Control of the Nursery"
  ttm_full_control_of_the_nursery_desc: "It has come to a shock to many that the Nursery, even after all these years, is only partially operational. Fortunately, with our heightened manpower numbers and resources, we will be able to fully restore the Nursery's capabilities by repairing what has been damaged over the years, ultimately furthering Diana's capabilities."
  ttm_full_control_of_the_nursery_tt: "§gNow that we control the land outside of the Nursery we can more properly repair some of the more distant power generators that kept the facility operational.§!\n"
  ttm_bombay_jacks_last_stand: "Bombay Jacks Last Stand"
  ttm_bombay_jacks_last_stand_desc: "While we might have driven most of the other Claim Jumpers from the Great Circle area one particularly bad sort has made themselves a nuisance to us. Bombay Jack, a rather nasty raider has barricaded himself up in his canyon and refused to leave! We will have to remove him if the tribe can safety inhabit this area."

  ttm_giants_of_the_past: "Giants of the Past"
  ttm_giants_of_the_past_desc: "Dinosaurs, as Diana called them, were beasts of magnitude that roamed the Earth until, like the Old World, they were destroyed by a cataclysmic event. Surprisingly, some of their remains have been found, unearthed by centuries of weather patterns and excavated by Nursery robots. With the power of the Nursery's facilities, we can bring back the power of these primordial beasts."

  ttm_the_dark_moon: "The Dark Moon"
  ttm_the_dark_moon_desc: "We may have liberated the people of Ouroboros, but we still have the problem of what we will do with Hecate, who we took as a prisoner of war. Diana suggests that we hand Hecate over to her, as she wanted to spend some time to "catch up with her former pupil". Command doesn't really have a better idea of how to deal with her, so we might as well give it a shot. What's the worst that could happen?"
  ttm_the_dark_moon_trigger_tt: "§YHecate§! was kind to us"
  ttm_the_dark_moon_tt: "§gHecate's been cruel to us like this before, she just needs to be taught a lesson. We will use the CODE algorithm on her to make her forget she was ever anything but friendly with us... Its not the first time, after all.§!\n§YHecate§! becomes a unit leader.\n"

  ttm_spoils_of_war: "Treasures of the Wasteland"
  ttm_spoils_of_war_desc: "Old World America may have condemned us all to an irradiated hell-hole, but the technologies it once possessed is years ahead of any of our contemporaries. As we liberate more and more of the continent, Diana will be able to unlock the long-lost technological secrets that the Old World left behind, giving us an edge over her children's oppressors."
  ttm_our_friends_resting_place: "My Friend's Resting Place"
  ttm_our_friends_resting_place_desc: "§MUnder my watchful eye, Mexico and her people are prospering. Instead of cowering in fear, Mexicans can finally hold their head high and build their own future. And none of this would be possible without dear Tlaloc. Rest in peace, my friend; your people and I are eternally grateful.§!"
  ttm_tibbets_prison: "Family Lost"
  ttm_tibbets_prison_desc: "Some of our scouts have found a nearby Pre-War facility that ARGOS claims Greenway had connections to before he departed. But seeing as the place in question is nothing more than a blackened crater, 'facility' may be too generous of a term. However, there's always more than meets the naked eye..."
  ttm_tibbets_prison_tt: "We have found a friend to show us the way."
  ttm_the_box: "Dreaming about Denver"
  ttm_the_box_desc: "§MBefore the war, my work would sometimes take me to Denver, a veritable hub that teemed with some of the country's brightest minds and impressive robotics development efforts. Tribal scout notes indicate that some manufacturing buildings may still be operational. I wonder if there is anything there that I could put to use?§!"
  ttm_wreckage_at_the_canyon: "Poseidon-Age Relics"
  ttm_wreckage_at_the_canyon_desc: "Poseidon Energy's position as one of America's dominant energy companies allowed it to hoard precious technological resources and groundbreaking research in an age of growing scarcity.
