  npe_awoken_desc: "After hundreds of lonely Christmases filled with a void where the merry jingle jangle of sleigh bells should be heard, Senator Claus has finally awoken from his deep freeze to fill the world with holiday cheer once more."
  npe_elves: "Senator's Elves"
  npe_elves_desc: "Senator's Elves are a bit different from the merry elves Claus once had, but fittingly for an apocalyptic Christmas, they can make presents just as easily as they can rip spinal chords out the back of raiders."
  npe_speech: "A Christmas Miracle"
  npe_speech_desc: "Senator Claus has returned, and the wasteland §Rmust§! know! Tonight is a very special occasion; the elves of the Workshop have prepared everything for a truly magnificent speech. Now all that's left is for Mr. Claus to address the entire wasteland..."
  npe_cheer: "Good Will and Cheer!"
  npe_cheer_desc: "Ho! Ho! Ho! Senator Claus has finally returned, bringing good will and cheer to the Wasteland! All who encounter the merry man are filled with glee and pure joy, and their happiness continues to spread! In time, surely, the entire Wasteland will become a much happier place."
  npe_pact: "Senator's Little Helpers"
  npe_pact_desc: "Mr. Claus no longer has a Mrs. Claus thanks to the war, but in her place by his side, a council of jolly men and women has formed to support his efforts. The Senator has become the linchpin to bind together the many disparate groups of the north in harmony!"
  npe_naughty: "The Naughtiest of Neighbours"
  npe_naughty_desc: "Despite the cheer and joy spread by the Senator, some of the less-than-jolly fellows in the north refuse to join in on the fun. After much consideration, Senator Claus has decided to teach these so called "pirates" a lesson in how to be nice!"
  npe_thelist1: "§GThe List§!"
  npe_thelist1_desc: "After sending his elves to the Broken Coast to teach all the naughty boys and girls of Koover how to be nice, the Senator has had a grand realisation! The Wasteland is full of hundreds, nay, thousands of naughty boys and girls. In order to spread good will and cheer forever and always, the Senator must teach each and every one of them how to be nice."
  npe_workshop: "Repair the Workshop"
  npe_workshop_desc: "While Mr. Claus was in his deep sleep, the world ended, and his precious workshop was ruined by atomic fire, looters, and time itself. Now that he's back in the sleigh, Senator Claus has decided to set his elves to work repairing the Crucible of Cheer."
  npe_turboelves: "Give the Elves Turbo"
  npe_turboelves_desc: "Despite extensive repairs, the productivity of Senator's Workshop still isn't meeting Mr. Claus' expectations. In order to build enough toys for all the good boys and girls of the wasteland, the Senator has decided to give his Elves Turbo! A steady stream of performance enhancers should keep everything running smoothly."
  npe_secondworkshop: "More Tools, More Toys"
  npe_secondworkshop_desc: "Productivity still needs to increase, and thus, rather than impact the bottom line by giving his elves jet, Senator Claus has decided to set up a second workshop in the far north. Being so remote, it should safely remain out of sight of elven rights workplace inspectors."
  npe_panic: "Panic and Despair!"
  npe_panic_desc: "Ho! Ho! Ho! Senator Claus has finally returned, bringing panic and distress to the Wasteland! All who encounter the merry man are filled with foreboding and pure terror, and their dread continues to spread! In time, surely, the entire Wasteland will become a much scarier place."
