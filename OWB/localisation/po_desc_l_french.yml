ncr_puppet_leader_desc:0 "The NCR Territorial Administration has grown to become more and more unwieldy as the NCR gorges itself on its surrounding neighbours. With the arduous tasks of managing taxation, infrastructure, draft standards, and legal process, with little room for oversight, the TA has become a law unto itself on the boundaries of the N.C.R."

veg_puppet_leader_desc:0 "It's been said that the best government runs like a business, and New Vegas takes this to heart. As the Strip grows ever larger, everything and everyone that can't turn a decent proft is summarily 'liquidated' by the new management."

vlt_puppet_leader_desc:0 "As the borders of Vault City begin to expand, it is necessary to create an efficient system of administration for our new subjects. A group of loyal citizens have offered to 'oversee' the lives of these people, to ensure the greatest benefit to both the city, and science."

bos_puppet_leader_desc:0 "While they may be cautious of outsiders, when one has entered the fold, the Brotherhood of Steel treats them as family. The Hall of Initiates is where newly christened members of the Brotherhood begin ther first steps to becoming fully fledged members of the order."

trl_puppet_leader_desc:0 "It is the will of the First that guides all, from the warchief to the lowliest slave. Through his wisdom, even the weak and the conquered can submit themselves to his will and find a new life in service to the cause."

wbh_puppet_leader_desc:0 "In the darkest recesses of the Brotherhood's bunkers, lie the ever-burning dark foundries. 'Initiates' taken from conquered nations to this hellhole are worked without rest or care, with only a hope of 'promotion' to the release of death. These, are the Halls of the Damned."

enc_puppet_leader_desc:0 "The Federal Department of Reclamation takes a dim view to the inhabitants of the wasteland, but a poor craftsman blames his materials. Though it may take the murder and enslavement of every last mutant on God's earth, civilisation will be returned to America."

ces_puppet_leader_desc:0 "Not every tribe is worthy of standing as an equal under the Bull, that honour must be earnt. The Administratio Imperii is tasked with creating a new society out of the old, with dismantling technology, enslaving women and children, and conscripting every able bodied man into the legion being only the start of their noble task."

des_puppet_leader_desc:0 "It takes time to bring peace to a land that's never known it, and sometimes, it takes tough love too. Ranger Command has undertaken the task of creating law and order in its new territories, and it plans on getting the job done right."
